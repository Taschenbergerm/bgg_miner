Allied with an ancient Deep Ones tribe, the Cult of the Black Sun is preparing a dark ceremony to summon the great Cthulhu.&#10;&#10;Shadows over Normandie is a squad/platoon sized game based on the Heroes System and is totally compatible with the Heroes of Normandie board game. The game features three opposing armies controlled by the players. These forces include the German Cult of the Black Sun, the ancient Deep Ones, and the U.S. Rangers. Each force is made up of infantry, tanks or creatures and of course, heroes and villains. Each unit has its own set of unique characteristics and skills depicted on the high quality chunky tokens.&#10;&#10;Players use order tokens to determine initiative and to bluff. While a single six-sided die determines combat, action cards are played to spice things up. Secretly plan your attacks and outwit your opponent. Block the opposing strategy and surprise the enemies. Deploy your units and don't turn back!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Street Dice is a 2 - 4 Player game. Players all start with a car and use the dice to race each other. If you lose your car in a Race you must Borrow, Earn, or Steal another.&#10;&#10;GAME SET UP:&#10;&#10;Separate the dice and the cards and place them on the table like in diagram 1. Deal 1 Car card to each of the players in the game. Place the other 3 with the pink side up in the middle of the table like it shows on the diagram.&#10;&#10;GAME PLAY:&#10;&#10;3-4 Player:&#10;&#10;All players roll 2 of their qualifying dice for a chance at  the 1st turn. The player with the highest total will get the first turn. In the case of a tie, the players tied will re-roll.&#10;&#10;After the order is decided the game play begins.(Turns will continue as the game progresses to the left.)&#10;&#10;RACING:&#10;&#10;Setting the Qualifying Combo: On the player&rsquo;s turn they are automatically in the dig(the race). Player 1 rolls their 3 qualifying dice to set the combo for the others to get into the race. After the combo is set, player 1 says, &ldquo;On your mark, get set, go!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Qualifying: The other players roll their 3 qualifying dice as quickly as they can to qualify for the dig. Once someone rolls the right combo they yell out that they have it. If there is a tie Player 1 re-rolls another combo and the tied parties re-roll.&#10;&#10;Only 2 players race in a dig. Once the qualifying is done the 2 players each draw a Start Stage Card ad place it face down in front of them. They also get the 9 start stage dice (Red, Yellow, &amp; Green) and place them in front of them.&#10;&#10;Start the Race: One of the other players not in the race will start the race by saying, &ldquo;On your mark, get set, go!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Starting Stage: Both players then flip over the Starting Stage card and begin to roll the combo&rsquo;s associated with the card. The dice can only be rolled with the same color. Players roll the 3 red dice first and try to roll the combo shown on the card. If the player rolls 1 of the three dice in the combo they move the correct die to the side and continue rolling the other dice until the combo is rolled correctly. Then the player moves onto the yellow dice and finally the green dice.&#10;&#10;Fast Start Bonus: The first player to finish the Stage Combo draws a Fast Start Bonus Card. Fast start bonus cards work in two ways, but always help the one that draws the card. The bonus card will either have a plus or minus symbol on the card. If it has a plus it will also show 1 or 2 dice that need to be rolled by their opponent after they have finished rolling their 10 race dice. If the card has a plus the player places the card face up in front of their opponent. If the card has a minus then the player removes 1 or 2 cards from their necessary 10 race dice.&#10;&#10;Race Dice: After the players finish rolling the stage dice they move onto the 10 black race dice. As they finish the stage dice the players draw a race dice card and flip it over to reveal the combo they must roll to advance. Just like the starting stage if the player rolls any number of the ten dice in the combo correctly they move the correct dice to the side and continue rolling the other dice until the combo is rolled correctly.&#10;&#10;Finish Line Bonus:  Just like the Fast start bonus this card works 2 ways. There is only a plus 1 or a minus 1. If it is a plus one the extra die is shown on the card and their opponent must roll that extra die after they have rolled their 3 finish line dice to win the race.&#10;&#10;Finish Line Dice: There are 3 checkered finish line dice. Each player draws a finish line card after they finish their combo on their 10 race dice. The combo for victory is on the card and who ever finishes that combo first wins the race and wins their opponents car and pink(title).&#10;&#10;PLAYER WITHOUT A CAR: If a player does not have a car they cannot qualify to race until it is their turn again and they get a car.&#10;&#10;NEXT TURN:&#10;&#10;After the race play moves to the next player to the left. If they have a car they roll their qualifying dice to initiate qualifying for the next race. If they do not have a car they have one of three chances to get another car. If they get a car they then roll the qualifying dice to initiate a race. If they are unable to secure a car it is the next player&rsquo;s turn.&#10;&#10;Borrow a car from Leg Breaker Lou: His car is in the middle of the table face down with his die on top of it. To borrow the car the player must roll the die and land on any number except for Lou&rsquo;s face. If the player rolls Lou&rsquo;s face they are not allowed to borrow the car and their turn is over. However, if they do borrow the car they immediately roll the qualifying combo to initiate a race. Moving forward in the game with Leg Breaker Lou&rsquo;s car; each time the player qualifies for a race they must roll the Leg Breaker Lou die before the race begins. If they roll Lou&rsquo;s face they get their legs broken and must forfeit the car and qualifying is started over for the other players. They must wait until their next turn to get another car. If Leg Breaker Lou takes his car back it is placed face down on the table under his die again.&#10;&#10;Steal a Car: The car is in the middle of the table with the Popo die on top of it. To steal the car the player must roll the die and land on any number except for the Popo&rsquo;s face. If the player rolls the Popo&rsquo;s face they are caught and can&rsquo;t steal the car and their turn is over. However, if they do steal the car they immediately roll the qualifying combo to initiate a race. Moving forward in the game with a stolen car; each time the player qualifies for a race they must roll the Popo die before the race begins. If they roll the Popo they get arrested and must forfeit the car and qualifying is started over for the other players. They must wait until their next turn to get another car.&#10;&#10;Earn a Car: The car to earn is in the middle of the table face down with 2 dice on it. To earn the car the player must roll the 2 dice and roll 7, 11 or double $. If the player rolls the dice correctly they earn the car and they immediately roll the qualifying dice to initiate a race. If they don&rsquo;t get the correct roll, their turn is over and it is the next player&rsquo;s turn.&#10;&#10;&#10;    IF A PLAYER ALREADY HAS A CAR THEY CANNOT TRY TO EARN ONE OF THE CARS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE. &#10;&#10;&#10;Special Ability:&#10;&#10;Each car has a special ability that can be used once in a game. When the player decides to use the special ability, they turn the card sideways. The move is valid for that turn only and cannot be used again by that player during the game. If another player wins the car and uses it in a race they can use the special ability once as well.&#10;&#10;WINNING THE GAME:&#10;&#10;To win the game a player must hold 4 cars in their garage at the same time. After you have 4 cars you are the Street Dice Champion.&#10;&#10;",

They'll have a bit of time to create a simple plot, mixing the panels they have and creating a full comic page, following the theme of the story. The fun part comes when those crazy stories get actually told...and reviewed!&#10;&#10;Co-Mix tests players' imagination and creativity, putting them in the shoes of comic writers with a strict schedule. They need to think quickly, get inspiration by the panels in their hand (with hundreds of panels included in the game), craft their story, and expose their creations to each other.&#10;&#10;Co-Mix is a game for everyone. The inspirational illustrations, with their varied set of characters, actions and settings, guides the players through the creation of short, fun and (more often than not) crazy stories that are sure to cause more than one laugh.&#10;&#10;",

There are 132 tiles each being in one of the four board colours and players each start with 12 of these and top up to 12 after their turn.&#10;&#10;The first player must play a legal word through the Start square and thereafter players must play a word that intersects orthogonally with at least one existing word in crossword fashion. Intersection may be achieved by playing a word that adds a letter at the beginning or end of an existing word except the adding of a plural &quot;S&quot; is not allowed.&#10;&#10;You score for every letter in the word(s) created. Basic scoring is by tile colour, blue=1, yellow=2, green=3 and red=4.&#10;However, if you play a tile that matches the board square tile you have made an ACE. Each ACE initially scores a bonus or 10 in addition to normal score. After a player has made ten ACES, future scores are doubled, after 15 ACES trebled etc.&#10;&#10;There is a bonus of 25 if you form a word with all the letters of the same colour (a Colourword).&#10;&#10;The games ends when a). Players can no longer form words, b). when a player can no longer top up to 12 or c). when a player plays a word that goes over one or more of the Finish squares where they will earn the finish square bonus(es).&#10;&#10;",

Because of their locations and wealth, some of these territories will be important and powerful, while others will be insignificant and weak.  The rich ones contain &quot;resources&quot; such as Gold, Horses, Iron, Coal, or Timber, which you will work to acquire because of the powerful weapons and cities they can buy.&#10;&#10;The action in Lords of Conquest takes place in yearly cycles.  Each year has four of five phases.  During each phase, you will have an opportunity to make decisions in preparation for that year's action.  The first phase is Development, during which you can invest in new weapons and cities.  Development begins during the second year, and is the first phase of all subsequent years.  The other phases are 1. Productions, in which your resource-bearing territories produce wealth; 2. Trading; 3. Shipment, in which you have an opportunity to move either your wealth or some of your forces to a more strategic location; and 4. Conquest, in which you relentlessly assault your neighbors' territories.&#10;&#10;Battles between territories are decided on the basis of the number of supporting territories and forces (in the form of weapons, horses, boats and cities) held by each side.  During the year, all the players will have a chance to expand their territories and wealth at the expense of their neighbors.  Ultimately, you become strong enough to start building cities. The first player to build three cities, and successfully defend them for a year, is the winner.  One last word of advice, show no mercy, and expect none!  Not everyone has what it takes rules the world.&#10;&#10;",

Characters have Stats, which represent their physical body, and Skills, which represent their learned behaviors. As the Game Master plays out the Timeline of the adventure, the players must creatively apply their powers, try to avoid using the dice to check against their Stats, and increase their Skills, as they navigate the past and meet the goals set for them by Time Corps Supreme Command. But the window into the past is quickly closing - if you don't accomplish your mission in time, you never will!&#10;&#10;This game is available for FREE DOWNLOAD as a PDF off of the Time Wars Universe website.&#10;&#10;",

In Robot Deputies in Outer Space, you are a robot competing to become the new sheriff in town. With the help of an assistant, robots work to collect batteries, a valuable commodity on the planet Scyprus. Batteries are traded to upgrade robot's software, weaponry and disguises. When a robot is equipped, they may choose to venture into space in pursuit of wanted criminals. Once an outlaw has been captured, deputies must decide to take the honest route and put the outlaw behind bars, or free the outlaw and collect bribe money. Taking bribes may allow for bigger upgrades to nail more notorious criminals, but the residents of Scyprus are watching. The deputy who makes the most impressive arrests will be elected Sheriff, while the remaining robots remain deputies.&#10;&#10;Robot Deputies in Outer Space is a 2-4 player strategy/ worker placement game.

Can you be the first to lay claim to the island of Ibyron?&#10;&#10;Develop your land from farm to city and be the first to build your civilization from the resources the island of Ibyron offers... Come, discover a new world...!&#10;&#10;Ibyron: Island of Discovery is a two-tiered worker placement game wherein players all work the land of a newly-discovered island to build their city the biggest before the other players. Using resource gathering, building construction, exploration and movement mechanisms for the Wilderness Phase, supported by an additive Worker Placement mechanism during the Village Phase, each player will design their own city; each building adding to options in game play.&#10;&#10;Each player will start out in the Wilderness phase each round. Actions will consist of using workers tokens on the island tiles, some actions requiring 1 or more workers to be used to perform that action. Players will continue in the Wilderness phase until they run out workers to perform said actions. But if a player finishes their wilderness actions before others, they don't just sit around; they head into the Village phase and may get better placements for their workers on the Village board.&#10;&#10;In the Village phase the players will use the same workers that worked for them in the Wilderness phase in this phase as well, but will instead perform money-making, shipbuilding, hiring horses, taxing, and farming actions. Each space in the village requires 1 more worker for each additional use, no matter the player. After the workers are again spent, they go into the rest box to wait to be paid to work again in the following round, in cash or food.&#10;&#10;Each building that is constructed will require permanent residence i.e. worker tokens will be used as the building itself. Using worker tokens as buildings will cut down on a player's supply of workers available in following rounds, so knowing when to construct buildings is an important timing constraint.&#10;&#10;There is a race to the end game, but getting there will support many strategies. The first player to build a complete working city (all but 1-3 worker tokens used in buildings), wins.&#10;&#10;It was heavily inspired by the Splotter games: Roads &amp; Boats and Antiquity. It was not designed to replace those games, but to deeply entrench you for a good 2 hours. A shorter beginner game can be played in around an hour, missing a few buildings and the entire Village Phase; found in the files section along with solo/co-op rules as well.&#10;An advanced game is available using the same components. The second edition of the game uses tri-hex tiles.&#10;&#10;",

Too many tomatoes and you'll lose the game!&#10;&#10;- Each Act (player) takes a score card.

All Show requirements must be completed before moving on to the next stage.&#10;&#10;- Each turn is a Performance. On a Performance, an Act will roll six of the custom Performance dice. Set aside any 'keepers'. You can end your Performance to score at any time. To re-roll, a die must be discarded from the remaining dice.&#10;&#10;- Show requirements are checked off the scorecard when they are completed.&#10;&#10;- If an Act fails to Perform a Show requirement by the end of their Performance, they must collect a tomato and roll the Technical Difficulties die.

It has a Euro-influenced, worker placement mechanic where you have two types of workers: the lowly henchmen that you use to claim a room, and the boss that can command henchmen to activate the ability of the room. You spend Work Tokens to command a henchmen, but if you command another player&rsquo;s henchmen, you have to give that player the Work Token. It also has an expanding score track that doubles as the elevator shaft, which affects your build options and game strategy in interesting ways.&#10;&#10;It is a small-box strategy game that plays more like a big-box game. The game is highly thematic, from the tongue-in-cheek art style, to the streamlined gameplay that rewards villainous actions.&#10;&#10;Command your workers and make judicious use of scant resources to build an optimum lair, and gain the boss's favor.&#10;&#10;",

By using artists, merchants, politicians, and spies at crucial moments, you can raise your family's reputation among the city's key factions, securing council positions for those loyal to you.&#10;&#10;The game takes place over 9 to 11 rounds.  In each round, a few of the 15 council seats are emptied.  For each empty seat, a specific faction (guild, church, academy...) will eventually choose who fills it.  Before that, however, players can use cards (artists, merchants, clergy...) to influence their reputation with these factions.  Each card, however, has more than one way to be used, and cannot be used again for several rounds.  Do you seize power now, or bide your time?&#10;&#10;An event deck starts each round, emptying council seats and bringing additional cards into play.  When the critical &quot;Vote&quot; event comes up, the house with the most seats on the council wins.&#10;&#10;",

You could be in the Mafia, whose goal is to gain majority in the town by eliminating the townspeople. You could be one of those townspeople, attempting to rid their beloved city of all dangerous and malicious folks. Or, you could have your own goals, and be one of the several different 3rd party roles present in this game.&#10;&#10;The game runs between cycling day and night rounds. During the night rounds, the Mafia wakes and chooses one person to kill off, and some other roles wake up and prowl the night. Then, everyone wakes up and a day round starts. During the day round, people discuss the recent happenings in the town, and try and see if there is someone suspicious enough to vote off. Once the voting happens, it's back to a night round until someone wins!&#10;&#10;",

Or you can choose those that have sworn their lives to protect their Daimyo; the brave guards of the Prefecture of Ryu.&#10;&#10;The ninjas play cooperatively discovering weapons from shuriken to poisoned rice, dispatching guards as they seek to complete their goals.&#10;&#10;The guard boss player employs all the resources at hand to bring their deadly foe to a halt. If they can hold them off until sunrise or raise the alarm then all will be safe for another night.&#10;&#10;Ninja or guards, players face difficult decisions. Do the ninja recklessly force their way through their opponents whilst undoubtedly raising the alarm level, go too slowly and stealthily though and they face losing the advantage that night brings, dawn ultimately bringing an unreckonable force down upon them. Do the guards throw themselves in the way of their more deadly rivals or strategically attempt to slow them down? Rise of the Kage offers a great blend of sneaky skills and gobsmacking kills.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Pro Bionics League Robots (PBL ROBOTS) is a card &amp; dice rolling game for two players (variant rules for multiplayer, expansions to support multi-player and other game variations are also in the works) who draft and build decks to build up (upgrade) a super powered robot while blasting apart their opponent's robot. Once you blow off all 4 limbs (head, left arm, right arm, legs) of the opposing robot, you win the game. A unique stacking mechanic makes building your robot visually appealing and functions as an important part of the gameplay. Attacks and defenses are determined by die rolls. Years of playtesting with multiple teams across the country (Maine, Minnesota, Wisconsin and North Dakota) has developed the game into a highly competitive format that is appealing for hardcore gamers and still very fun for the casual gamer. Rule variations support new players and tournament rules for more hardcore players.&#10;&#10;",

Depending on the kind of worker and the field the worker gets placed on, they get different advantages, such as improvements of their skills, the possibility to build stands or money and equipment. Also there are different regions on the board in which the majority of workers gives the players special bonuses.&#10;&#10;Besides placing workers the player also have cards to play which can give you an advantage or spoil your opponent. Since the game is about a medieval tournament, there sure are some fights. These fights are resolved with custom fight dice. In the fights, the players use their collected equipment to gain advantages.&#10;&#10;Another important part of the game is building stands for the crowd that is going to watch the tournament. There are different stands that will provide space for different kinds of supporters. The more supporters one knight has at the end of the game, the more victory points he will get.&#10;&#10;&#10;In &quot;Das Turnier&quot; versuchen die Spieler mit ihrem Gefolge die meisten Anh&auml;nger zu gewinnen, um ihren Ritter zum Sieg zu f&uuml;hren.&#10;&#10;Das Spiel verl&auml;uft &uuml;ber mehrere Runden, in denen die Spieler ihre Gefolgsleute auf den Spielplan setzen.

Da es um ein Ritterturnier geht, d&uuml;rfen auch kleine Scharm&uuml;tzel nicht fehlen, die durch spezielle Kampfw&uuml;rfel ausgetragen werden. Dabei kommen den Spielern die im Spiel gesammelten Ausr&uuml;stungen zu Gute.&#10;&#10;Au&szlig;erdem k&ouml;nnen alle Spieler Trib&uuml;nen erbauen, was zum einen Punkte bringt und ihnen zum anderen erm&ouml;glicht, eigene Anh&auml;nger in die Arena zu locken, die ihnen wichtige Punkte bringen.&#10;&#10;",

A world where the right germ could fall into the wrong hands and wipe out a nation; Where shadows and computers control our money; and mankind has learned how destroy himself with the press of a button.&#10;You can see the writing on the wall&hellip; Things are escalating, but you've got a plan, and you&rsquo;ll be ready&hellip;&#10;&#10;Collapse is a deck building card game for 2-4 players set in the final months before the end of the world. Players can choose to play one of four world-ending Collapse scenarios, including: financial, biological, natural, or nuclear; Or they can play at random where any combination of events may occur.&#10;&#10;When playing Collapse, you will need to stock up on supplies such as food and weapons, as well as build fortifications on your home to earn months of survival time. Just remember, time is running out, and you and your neighbors are competing for the same resources. If you are going to survive, you will need a healthy mix of strategy and flexibility as available supplies change and events unfold.&#10;&#10;The cards are down, and everything is on the line&hellip; How will you survive the impending Collapse?&#10;&#10;",

During your journey, you need to achieve your scenario objective, then return to the king's castle in the middle of the board.&#10;&#10;Each turn starts with bidding to see who will first use magic and who will first move on the board. During the magic phase, players take turns trying to harm opponents with nasty magic tricks or enhance their own character's abilities. Movement takes place on a game board divided into three continents, and the two inner continents can be moved via magic stones to hinder an opponent's movement or allow a player access to blocked areas. During the journey, players need to combat opposing figures, destroy monsters, find treasures that might boost character abilities, and gain or invade resource pools to fuel a player's economy.&#10;&#10;Realm of Wonder mixes area control, dice rolling, and bluffing. The game is beautifully drawn with a set of miniature figures for each character. Random elements can be minimized with an alternative rule set that makes this a great game for both younger people above 9 and hardcore gamers alike. Playing time with six players should be less than an hour.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Welcome to Sri Lanka in the late middle ages. This small island to the South of India is well known for its gemstones. And welcome to Ratnapura, the city of gems and the seat of king Parakkamabahu II. The royal treasurer died and the king is looking for a suitable successor to take care of his vast collection of precious stones and to grow the king&rsquo;s richess. Any suitable candidate has not only to know everything there is to know about gems, but also has to be a cunning business man who understands how to manipulate the market so that he can triumph over all the others.&#10;&#10;In the game of Ratnapura the players have a hand of gem cards which they play in order to win tricks. The trump values of several of the suits are determined at the start of the game and can be influenced by the players by winning &ldquo;grand tricks&rdquo;. Changing the value of those suits is crucial for improving your chances of winning tricks, but all the other players will try to do the same. A number of special suits can be used to secure especially valuable tricks or to dump worthless glass marbles into other players treasure vaults.&#10;&#10;Ratnapura uses a specially prepared deck for all player counts and thus plays as well with 2 players as it does with the full complement of 5.&#10;&#10;Cool Factors:&#10;- A trick-taking game that actually plays equally well with 2 or 5 players;&#10;- Adjustable trump values.&#10;&#10;",

Face the challenge and emerge victorious in the end!&#10;Don't let your rivals outwit you!&#10;&#10;Heroes is a dynamic real-time game for 2-4 players, in which players become true heroes of a magical fantasy world, possessing great powers related to different elements: air, water, fire, etc. and leading powerful fantasy armies. They send their creatures &mdash; such as dragons, elementals, ifrits, hydras or gnomes &mdash; to a battle against the opponent's troops. The aim of the game is to defeat the opponent's hero and army.&#10;&#10;In each battle you will summon the mighty forces of nature and the beasts which were born from them. You will chose on your own which of them will accompany you in tides of battle.&#10;&#10;Using magic dice you will cast spells or dispel those belonging to your enemies, activate your foes or learn new magic incantations. Perceptivness, reflexes and a well-thought-out strategy are the keys to victory.&#10;&#10;One of key tasks for each player is to properly use of any cards that he own and creatures that he controls. He must quickly analyze scores on his dice because only given sets of symbols will allow him to use abilities and cast spells.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In the early 21st century the Rytell Corporation created the first androids, vat-grown, speed aged, altered humans with a shortened lifespan. These androids, and the cheap disposable labor they represented paved the way for the exploration of space and Earth&rsquo;s first &ldquo;Off World Colonies&rdquo;. Mining corporations soon began to exploit the riches of the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. In Off World Colonies players pilot mining ships in the asteroid belt finding resources needed for a depleted, desperate Earth. Players will use androids for labor and defensive armies on their mining claims. Beware the new generation of Androids - Naxos 7 - resent their lower class status and have begun to revolt.&#10;&#10;Off World Colonies is a game for 1 to 3 players lasting 20-30 minutes.&#10;&#10;Players have 3 action points (AP) to spend each turn in the game (in a 2 or 3 player game, the 2nd and 3rd player each get one additional AP for their first turn). Players may earn more APs as the game progresses.&#10;&#10;A player can land on an asteroid, orbit the comet or dock at PKD Station and remain there for multiple turns if they desire. Only one player may mine any one asteroid at any one time. Multiple players may be orbit the comet or be docked at PKD Station.&#10;&#10;On a player&rsquo;s turn they may do one or more of the following, spending their AP:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Stake a Claim&#10;    Mine an Asteroid&#10;    Refuel&#10;    Refine Fuel&#10;    Defense&#10;    Claim Jump&#10;    Attack&#10;    Process Resources&#10;    Buy Upgrades&#10;&#10;&#10;During the game androids are blind drawn from the game bag by players. If all players have completed a single turn and none have purchased any androids during that time, the first player must blind draw an android from the game bag and place it on PKD station.&#10;&#10;Once all the number of white Naxos 7 Androids have been drawn from the bag (3 - 1 player, 4 - 2p, 5 - 3p), the androids begin their revolt and take over the asteroids and the comet, preventing players from using them.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a specific number of tiles have been flipped over either due to being mined out or take over by the Naxos 7 Androids.&#10;&#10;For 1 player = 5 tiles&#10;For 2 players = 6 tiles&#10;For 3 players = 7 tiles&#10;&#10;The player with the highest number of credits is the winner. In the case of a tie, the player with the greatest number of androids (in the Cryopod and on any asteroids) is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

No Zones of Control, per se.&#10;&#10;Combat results are unusually unpredictable, making the game good for solitaire play.&#10;&#10;There is an abstracted, mini version of the units - order of battle - which I personally prefer.&#10;&#10;Because the combat is hex-side, the map should be made at least 22&quot; wide.&#10;&#10;It is corps-army level - also with air and naval fleet and air units - having monthly turns with Blitzkrieg/breakthrough possibilities, initially for Germans in Good weather.&#10;&#10;It includes the Finnish front, although it is up to the Axis player whether or not Finland becomes active.&#10;&#10;The Operation Barbarossa scenario is typically 2-3 hours long - shorter with 4 players. Darkest Crusade can go longer if players wish to continue the game past April 1942&#10;&#10;",

And the others can&rsquo;t just sit there and listen. One thing beats the next, and the alcohol helps them exaggerate. In the end, the mayors end up having a match for who&rsquo;ll be the next mayor. Whoever has the best developped village, whoever uses their resources best will be the winner! And as you know, that&rsquo;s your village. You just have to show the others!&#10;&#10;",

The Priestess can pretend to be part of the Minister's team, all in the name of helping the Princess.&#10;&#10;Team Princess wins if the Minister is captured or the third round ends.

If correct, they reveal their card. Otherwise, reveal yours.&#10;- Hide/protect: defend yourself or another player for the rest of the round. (Cannot be done in third round)&#10;- Disrupt: cause another player who hasn't taken their turn yet to lose their turn this round. You are then captured. &#10;- Capture: &quot;capture&quot; a revealed character. A captured character is out of the game, but still wins if their team wins.

        "description": "Perfect Earth Explorer is a card game in which 2 players (ages 7+) get to introduce a rich variety of animals to their own Rainforest, which they first have to grow from a diversity of habitats.&#10;&#10;At the start of each game, every player draws an explorer card with a unique mission. Players take turns, which typically consist of drawing a card and playing a card. Players will have to play Rainforest habitat cards before they can start to introduce animals to their Rainforest.&#10;&#10;Certain habitat cards allow only certain animal categories to be introduced, whereas other habitat cards will allow any animal to be placed.&#10;&#10;That brings us to the animal cards. We have included 36 animal cards in the game. There are 6 animal categories, each of which feature 6 animal cards. The category is specified with the help of a small icon.&#10;&#10;12 of the 36 animals are in fact threatened animal species, indicated by the red circle behind the animal. Each animal card is worth a certain amount of points. Threatened species typically generate more points than common species. But placing an animal in its favorite habitat will also trigger bonus points, etc. To add some charm, we have included short facts on every animal card.&#10;&#10;There is one more card type we have to introduce to you. We have included 12 event cards to make the game less predictable and to help balancing of the game. We believe the event cards are also a great way to add some extra emotion to the game.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one of the players introduces a 10th species to his or her rainforest, at which time the point total of both players is calculated.&#10;&#10;",

All we have now is Dust.&quot;&#10;&#10;Sovereignty of Dust is a post apocalyptic strategy card/dice game for 2-5 players.&#10;&#10;Featuring a sandbox day/night system and both free-for-all and team based play, players take on the role of one of five factions vying for control of the ruins of a once-great metropolis now known only as &quot;Dust.&quot;&#10;&#10;Capture your enemies, meet trade caravans and vicious gun runners, collect useful items and resources in the wasteland, gather intel on your opponents and undertake missions to carve your place in a crumbling world.&#10;&#10;Players begin by selecting their faction:&#10;&#10;    &quot;The Staten Island Resistance&quot; - A ragtag group of soldiers fighting for what's left of humanity.&#10;    &quot;Brothers of Dust&quot; - Though most would view them as a fanatical cult, the Brothers of Dust see themselves as the only light left in the world. &#10;    &quot;Long Island Greasers&quot; - Bikers influenced by the mentality of mid-20th century anarchist punk rockers. Their only goal is to reduce the city to smoldering ash. &#10;    &quot;Pax Americana&quot; - The scientists and intellects who survived the fall of the civilization. They consider themselves true patriots, fighting for the American way.&#10;    &quot;The Ward&quot; - Beneath the ruins of Dust, an army of monstrous human experiments is growing by the day, led by a crazed asylum doctor.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Each faction has a preconstructed deck of cards, and a unique ability.&#10;At the beginning of each turn, players will discard any cards they have in play and draw three new character cards to the field of play. One action may be taken per turn by each of these characters. Actions include:&#10;&#10;    Combat against another player's character or a city landmark.&#10;    Scouting the wastelands for supplies, or undertaking a mission on behalf of their faction.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Victory points are awarded for capturing enemy units, conquering landmarks, and completing missions in the wasteland. Once the day/night deck has been depleted - the player with the most victory points wins the game!&#10;&#10;",

It is designed to help children learn basic arithmetic calculations, while encouraging them to learn how to gradually  speed up their mathematical calculations. The game is designed to enable players to use strategy to play efficiently.  Players will need to know when to play a high tile or when to play a low tile, when to take risks and when not to.  This will help to give players that preparation to analyze and make informed decisions based on their evaluations. Most importantly the game is designed to include the whole family.&#10;&#10;&#10;    Promotes family bonding &amp; team-building&#10;    Teaches sportsmanship&#10;    Promotes socialization &amp; Improves self-esteem&#10;    Teaches interpersonal &amp; communication skills&#10;    Teaches arithmetic and analytical skills&#10;    Develops thinking skills and enhances decision-making&#10;    Develops cognitive and spatial abilities.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game plays a lot like Dominioes except instead of number tiles there are addition, subtraction, multiplication and division tiles.  Tiles are added to the end of other tiles just like in Dominoes except that points are gained based on the tile played.  Players will then call out the correct answer to the math equation that they made and gain points if they're correct or possibly lose points if they're wrong.  Special lock tiles will make it where other players can't play on that end unless they have a special unlock tile.  The player whose points are closest to the target number that is rolled at the beginning of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

Or, your opponent&rsquo;s row contains all of the pyramids, in any legal arrangement and in any or all cells.  In either case, the arrangement of pieces must arise as the result of using all of your allocated movement points.&#10;&#10;On each turn a player takes two actions:&#10;&#10;1. Make a *controlled roll* of the die&#10;&#10;2. Move some number of pieces some number of squares orthogonally&#10;connected squares in the game arena&#10;On each turn the player to move is allocated a certain number of movement points as shown on the top of the die.&#10;&#10;A *controlled roll* is a method of choosing the value of the movement die by twisting, or manually tumbling it along the cells in a 3x4 grid.  This action allows players to plan for certain numbers occurring in the future or to prevent certain numbers from occurring that might benefit their opponent.  By using a *controlled roll* mechanism, Pungo eliminates chance entirely, but still maintains the feel of a dice-driven game.&#10;&#10;",

Take one deck, shuffle, then deal out 22 cards[.]&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to sort out the four suits and get them each into order. There are only six rules that you need to know [...]:&#10;&#10;Rule 1:    You can move any card from the top of one pile onto the top of another pile if the suits match and the card being moved is of a lower number (Aces are low).&#10;&#10;Rule 2:    When there are no more face-up cards on a pile, turn the topmost face-down card face-up.&#10;&#10;Rule 3:    Any card can be placed in an empty pile.&#10;&#10;Rule 4:    A descending run of cards in the same suit can be moved as a block.&#10;&#10;Rule 5:    At any time you may deal out the next 6 of the left-over cards:&#10;one onto each pile.&#10;&#10;Rule 6:    The game is won if each of the four suits is gathered together into a run from King down to Ace. If such a position cannot be reached, then the game is lost.&#10;&#10;&quot;Finally, you may wonder why the game is called Autumn Leaves. It is because of the way that the cards flutter back and forth between the piles during play. For me, this adds a sense of peace to the game. I find it strategically and tactically interesting, and yet at the same time I find it rather peaceful and meditative. I hope you do too.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

The military forces of Queen Victoria gather to repel an attack by the diabolical Martian forces under the command of the evil Martian overlord.&#10;&#10;The Martians have huge, mechanical tripod walkers, flying saucers, death rays, missile bases, and giant monsters at their disposal. They can also elicit help from sympathetic (read gullible) human proxies.&#10;&#10;The humans rely on conventional infantry, cavalry, and artillery, and perhaps a hero, for their main defense. Fortunately, the human player may get assistance from a mad scientist who can field an Infernal Machine that the Martians won't find amusing.&#10;&#10;The Martians have a choice of five different victory conditions. Part of the challenge for the human player is to determine the Martian overlord's true objectives so they can be best thwarted.&#10;&#10;",

It can thus play as a form of solitaire, or as a competitive game, depending upon how many wish to be involved. Players take turns in placing cards on the table forming an elaborate hierarchy that must obey a few strict rules. The aim is to place all of your cards, while preventing your opponents from doing so.&#10;&#10;Use two suits from a deck of playing cards, one red, one black. Place an Ace in the centre of the table, and place the other Ace crossed over it. Shuffle the other 24 cards.&#10;&#10;Connecting Cards:&#10;The main gameplay consists of connecting cards to form hierarchies. To connect a card in your hand to one in the tableau, the following conditions must be met:&#10;1. It must not overlap any of the cards in the tableau.&#10;2. It must not touch any card other than the one it is connecting to.&#10;3. Its short side must be placed flush against a side of the card in the tableau.&#10;4. The touching sides must touch in their centres.&#10;5. The two cards must be of the same colour.&#10;6. It must be at most three cards distant from the Aces. (It must connect to the Aces, or connect to a card that connects to the Aces, or connect to a card that connects to a card that connects to the Aces.)&#10;7. A single hierarchy (a tree of cards connected to the the Aces) cannot contain both ascending sequences of cards and descending sequences of cards.&#10;&#10;",

There will be 4 cards left over: these are simply discarded.&#10;&#10;The value of each card is as follows:&#10;&#10;- Aces are worth 1&#10;  - Number cards are worth their face value&#10;  - Jacks are worth 11&#10;  - Queens are worth 12&#10;  - Kings are worth zero&#10;&#10;",

There's not a registered CPU remaining it doesn't access. Everything is known, everyone is known. If the Grid isn't burned, it will control everything and our humanity will be lost.&#10;&#10;I've got the coordinates. It does have a physical mainframe we can strike, burn every program in it. We can show the world the danger complacency created, that we almost gave up our liberty for convenience.&#10;&#10;I've got Drone2004 and E-Terrier ready, but we can't do this without you. We lose, and humanity's freedom is gone. Of course, we do this, we'll be heroes. I figure we've got zero chance anyways, so let's call this Zero Day.&#10;&#10;In Zero Day, you are a hacker in a civilization built on technology. Your commensurately useful skill set will allow you to write code or reverse engineer it from ...other sources... and piece it together to find exploits that can be used against the oppressive Mainframe. The first player to inject enough exploits into the Mainframe to bring it under their own control wins &mdash; but be warned as the Mainframe will not sit idle when it detects intrusions!&#10;&#10;Every round you get three hacker action markers that can be used for one of three things:&#10;&#10;     Building up programs by &quot;writing&quot; them using appropriate sets of code cubes.&#10;     Running your programs to acquire exploit discs.&#10;     Reverse engineering other programs by swapping your resources for what's already there (which is also how you inject exploits into the Mainframe).&#10;&#10;&#10;You may retain action markers from round to round, but they (as well as your unused code and other discs) count against your limited total resource capacity. As a result, you must manage your actions and available space, and balance it with the risk that comes with having programs available to others.&#10;&#10;",

Each player gets a hand of three cards. The start player places a card face down &mdash; either in front of himself or in front of another player &mdash; and states its color. Each other player must play a card of this color if possible, either in front of himself or in front of another player; if you already have a card in front of you, then you must play it elsewhere.&#10;&#10;When a card is placed in front of you (except for the start player placing in front of himself), you can decide to fight by leaving your card in a vertical orientation or flee by turning it horizontal. Once each player has a card, those who fight reveal them, with the high value card winning the fight and leading to the next round. Those with the lowest-valued cards lose the round and gain one point. (Off-suit 2s and 4s reverse the trick to make the low card win, with multiple reverses being possible.)&#10;&#10;If the trick had a single loser, that player can charge someone who fled. The fleeing person can take points equal to the number of cards in front of him or reveal his card and fight, with the winner losing one point and the loser gaining one point.&#10;&#10;If players still have cards in hand, they play another round. Those who fled in the previous round will now have two cards in front of them, and the values of those cards are summed in a fight. Should a player's cards sum to three, then those who fled must fight in the round. When players have no cards in hand, players pick up cards in front of them, then deal out the discards until everyone has three cards.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player has five points. Whoever has the lowest score at this point wins.&#10;&#10;",

On each turn, players draw a small hand of Action cards and roll 5 custom dice. The symbols on the dice will shape what cards, gladiator skills and movements the player can make. The player with the most Glory at the end of the match wins.&#10;&#10;The tactical decisions are simple but deep: how best to use you&#10;positioning, cards and gladiator skills to maximize your Glory each turn. You also have to be aware of the NPC enemies, other players, and traps in the arena. Using the dangers of the arena to your advantage is key to your survival.&#10;&#10;There are multiple match formats, including standard (anyone can attack anyone), coop, grudge match, and more. A single match takes around 30 minutes, but you can also play a full tournament. Tournaments are 3 matches in a row, tweaking decks between each match.&#10;&#10;To win, players must pay attention to the crowd.  A deck of Crowd cards provides new ways of earning Glory as the match goes on, and the rewards are often far higher than those for simply killing your foes. Completing special objectives earns you Crowd Favor, which is worth a huge chunk of Glory at the end of the match. Favor will go back and forth between players during a match, and it is often the favorite who ends up winning.&#10;&#10;In the end, only Glory matters. Even if your gladiator dies, you can still win if you had a glorious death.&#10;&#10;",

The mayor hires several companies to build the network as a joint project, including yours! Naturally, you&rsquo;re trying to take the most credit for the network&rsquo;s success. Complete routes with a variety of buildings to earn credit! Achieve your secret objectives to win extra credit at the end of the game. The player with the most credit wins!&#10;&#10;How to Play:&#10;Each player has their own personal color-coded deck of Rail Cards. Each Rail Card features two lines and two terminals in various combinations, thus all presenting six different outlets with varying connections or dead ends amongst them. Each card also features two different buildings, each situated on either of the two lines. (There are five different types of buildings.)&#10;&#10;Players take turns laying down one card at a time, adjacent to existing cards, to build the map of the city. Cards must be placed in a &quot;brick&quot; pattern. If placed so that the short sides are adjacent to one another, the cards must be in a straight line. However, if placed so that the long sides are adjacent to one another, the cards must be off-set. In this manner, a single card may have up to six adjacent cards.&#10;&#10;There is another limit to placement: Cards may not be placed outside of the city limits. This is a final shape of the city determined by the number of players. Though you know what shape the city will take at the end of the game, there is no &quot;board&quot; which predefines the &quot;center&quot; of the city. The city grows and shifts with each new card played. Controlling the growth and logic of the city is fundamental to strategic play.&#10;&#10;Scoring and Victory:&#10;Score &quot;credit&quot; by having the most segments of your color comprising a complete route. A route is complete when it is capped at both ends by a terminal or when it is made into a loop. Score 1 credit for each different type of building on a complete route. Extra credits may be scored by completing secret objectives, most of which require the city to meet certain configurations.&#10;&#10;",

The Axis forces realized the Pedestal Convoy could very well be the battle for &quot;all the marbles&quot; and mobilized tremendous air, submarine and surface fleet assets to contest its passage. The Allied convoy was savaged but enough ships made it through, including the tanker Ohio whose ordeal was a true epic of wartime heroism, to enable Malta to hold out.&#10;&#10;Can you do better?&#10;&#10;",

Games people Play is a board game that dares you to go on a quest within the self to uncover your spiritual path. It will take you into the cycles that you encounter in your life and help you to understand how you have evolved. In this world of duality, the system created separation and disconnection within the people. It happened over and over again. Soon, people stopped be-living in themselves and an inner battle began. Chaos, destruction and sadness came into being in the outside world as the human beings became more disconnected and dysfunctional within themselves. Human beings got caught in the cycles that created turmoil within them and peace was no where to be found, until now.  Now the human beings are ready to reach themselves by embracing and uncovering the cycles within the self. They are ready to integrate their hearts and birth a higher perception of themselves.&#10;&#10;How to Play :&#10;&#10;This is an ancient game of serpents and arrows. The arrows make your energy go up and the serpents take your energy down.&#10;&#10;Role a dice and use your marker to move across the board. Read about the number you land on and meditate why you are there and where you are going, and where the synchronicity of the dice will take you. You can start if you throw a one on your dice. Then, the game begins! Use as a board marker something personal that has your energy. It could be a ring, a stone, a crystal etc. As you proceed in the game, you are led to different houses  and  the meaning of each house that you enter into during the game is written in the book that comes with the game.&#10;        &#10;     You win when you became a God-Goddess, the number 68, having perfect control of yourself and using your feminine power with all its divine implications. Meditate on this. Meditate in your circle. You will find this game a beautiful tool to knowing yourself.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

You can also try to get ahead of your rivals, by going further than any other into the sea and getting the biggest catch. But don&rsquo;t forget, that sea weather often changes and the storm can cause damage to your ship!&#10;Moreover, in those old times, the only way to keep the catch was to salt fish in barrels. So, along with fish, the Pomors need salt. If your options are limited at the moment, you can stop fishing and sell your salt to the other fishermen. If you correctly set the salt price, you will not only repair your broken ships but also get good earnings.&#10;&#10;",

She kept her hand resting on the familiar weight of her dagger's pommel. Someone here was a traitor... if only she knew who.&#10;&#10;Doppelg&auml;nger is a hidden role game designed by Steve Avery and Robert Burke. Each player takes the role of an intrepid adventurer who will help the group overcome great perils. However, some among them are conniving doppelg&auml;ngers who work against the party to bring their downfall.&#10;&#10;Each turn the players confront a challenge that requires teamwork.  The party leader selects which adventurers will help him win the encounter. Everyone selected contributes a card to the pool, and others are added from the draw pile. The party leader then distributes one item to each party member to help them in their quest. Success brings rewards and moves the party closer to uncovering the hidden truth. Failure brings pain and moves the doppelg&auml;ngers one step closer to victory.&#10;&#10;Doppelg&auml;nger feels like a fast, co-operative dungeon delve, but with the added tension of significant distrust.&#10;&#10;Game Overview&#10;&#10;Each round, the players confront a new Quest that requires teamwork, and a rotating Party Leader selects which adventurers go on that Quest. Every player selected contributes one Item card to a common pool, and other items are added randomly from the draw pile. These cards can be helpful, non-helpful, or even harmful. The Party Leader distributes one card to each party member, and the Quest commences, with each player taking a turn using the item they were given, if able. To use the items given, each player uses dice that are secretly pulled and rolled, but beware, doppelg&auml;ngers may choose to roll cursed dice! If the party succeeds, the Party Leader may search for an Artifact of Light. Find three of these, and the loyal adventurers win the game. However, if a Quest fails, an Artifact of Darkness may be found, and if three are uncovered, the doppelg&auml;ngers win. Players must also take care to watch their health, because if any player dies, the game ends, and the dead player's loyalty determines the winners and losers.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Cities of Darkscorch is a, decidedly adults-only, fever dream of a game in which players take on the role of ambitious rock bands, traveling from city to city and battling both the other players and a deck full of rival bands for supremacy. If a player can defeat a band in each of 16 cities, they can then move into the center city, and attempt to win one last battle to score a record contract, and win the game.&#10;&#10;The band names and logos, printed onto the old-school wooden 45rpm record adapters that are used as the player pawns, the board, and the card art and text combine to portray a world out of the school notebook of some mid-1970's Led Zeppelin loving, Dungeons and Dragons obsessive teenager.&#10;&#10;Players take turns moving around the board a number of spaces determined by the roll of a standard die, either fighting a band battle, rolling for movement again, or passing play depending on where they land. Each player holds a hand of five &quot;Fate&quot; cards, which might be one of four kinds of band members that can be played in front of the player, and persist from turn to turn; bonus cards that can help the player in battle; and cards that can be played to penalize other players. During a battle, the player draws a &quot;Foe&quot; card, representing a band they will battle, rolls a four-sided die to determine which band member will battle, and plays Fate cards to boost their chances. The result of the battle is found by rolling a twenty-sided die, plus whatever bonuses from the players own Fate cards, penalties from cards played by other players, versus a score on the Foe card. If the player wins the battle, they collect the &quot;banner&quot; for the city, tracked by each player on a card reminiscent of an auto-bingo card. Play passes around the table until a player collects all 16 of the banners, allowing them to finally enter the center city, &quot;Numenor&quot;, and battle one last time in a bid for victory.&#10;&#10;",

There are Orcs and thieves and wizards about causing all manner of mischief and mayhem!&#10;&#10;You start out with 15 gold coins and you must spend these when you first visit a tavern. There are 5 taverns in a game but each one has its own price and exit condition. This means that you could have a cheap night or an expensive one! There are challenge cards and chance cards, some that give you gold and others that take it away!&#10;&#10;(1) In a turn you enter a tavern &gt; pay for a drink &gt; take an    event card and follow its instruction &gt; end your turn.&#10;(2) On your following turns in a tavern you roll the die &gt; if it matches the number on the tavern you exit and repeat (1)&#10;(3) On your following turns in a tavern you roll the die &gt; if you fail to match the number on the tavern you stay in the current tavern &gt; take an event card and follow its instructions &gt; end your turn.&#10;&#10;If you run out of gold and you can't afford to pay at a tavern then you must steal gold until you have enough to continue, but don't get caught or you'll be kicked out and must go back to the previous tavern!&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to buy a drink in all of the taverns on the street and be the first player to leave the final tavern. However be warned that your fellow players can buy you a round if they can afford it and keep you in the final tavern a little longer!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Genpei Kassen (&#230;&#186;&#144;&#229;&#185;&#179;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#230;&#136;&#166;) is part of the 'historical' division of Bandai's 'if' series of games. It is translated as 'Genpei War'. The 'Gen' is the Chinese pronunciation of the character for Minamoto, one of the two main combatants. 'Pei' (or 'Hei) similarly refers to the Taira, so it's the 'Minamoto-Taira War'. A strategic simulation of the 1180-1185 conflict in Japan involving the Minamoto and Taira warrior houses, it reflects the fact that fighting was not done strictly along 'clan' lines by including as other factions the Kiso (a branch of the Minamoto), the Fujiwara, and the Imperial Family. The war is still a popular subject in Japan today, being immortalized by period literature such as the Heike Monogatari ('Tale of the Heike') and live performances by blind biwa (lute) players.&#10;&#10;The game is designed for 2-4 players taking the part of one of the four main combatants-the Taira (SW Japan), Kiso (a Minamoto branch, central Japan), Minamoto (SE Japan), and Fujiwara (N Japan). There are rules for a 5th player to operate abstractly as the Insei (retired Emperor) Go-Shirakawa, meddling with the plans of the four warrior houses. There are several different scenarios involving different numbers of players and levels of conquest. Gameplay features area movement of generic land and naval forces. Armies are generic and all have the same value, and are boosted by the values of leaders accompanying them. None of the leaders are named but each has a different skill level (if you're familiar with the history, it's easy to figure out the names that go with each leader counter). Naval warfare and sea movement of troops is somewhat abstract and confined to the southern areas of the map. Cardplay has a big effect on gameplay as cards can lead to possession of the Emperor, abundant crops, famine (denying victory points), access to independent naval forces, and other events. Victory is determined by both provinces held each turn (each province is worth a varying number of points) and enemy units destroyed.&#10;&#10;Starting positions for the game are somewhat historically inaccurate; this was done for play balance as the Kiso are facing a two front war with the other combatants initially only having one. Factions are differentiated by their leader and naval pools. The Fujiwara have no navy, three overpoweringly wealthy provinces, and have the strongest leader in the game (and an extremely strong sub-leader). The Kiso have a middling leader, no navy, 23 relatively poor provinces, and a small pool of back up leaders. The Minamoto have a solid and large leadership pool but no navy and start with 14 provinces worth a moderate amount. The Taira have the misfortune of having an excellent leader being a subordinate of the worst leader in the game, but start off with naval forces and 20 moderately valuable provinces. There are also 3 neutral provinces that can be invaded during the game. Overall, the game has a good feel for the war it seeks to recreate and the difficulties faced by each faction.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Dem Gems is a quick play micro game and the theme of Dem Gems is rather abstract, you're collecting gems in a stoney looking labyrinth as a small coloured cylinder.... Basically you are there to collect as many gems as possible in an ever changing maze while you try to avoid holes, bombs and other players.&#10;&#10;The cards are narrow domino cards which are first shuffled and then 8 of them are laid out face up to make a 4 x 4 square board. The remaining cards are then dealt out equally face down to the players, any remaining cards are put to one side. Each player puts their piece at a corner (not on the board yet) and rolls the die to determine who goes first. &#10;You roll the die and you MUST move your piece that number of spaces even if it means losing gems! After you have moved you then place one of your cards from your hand onto the board to change the layout. This can be to your advantage or to sabotage another player.&#10;&#10;Keep track of your scores with a notepad and pen to make it easier and once all players have played their cards and had an equal number of turns you count up the scores. The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

The better they do during training, the easier they catch cattle in the field. Be smart and get in your opponents&rsquo; way with mean tricks by snatching the most valuable cattle from under their noses, or swing your lasso to abduct one of their animals. At home, sort your cattle by race and assemble them in herds only to sell them later for as many Pesos as possible.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to collect sets of cattle tiles and sell them. Each cattle tile has a value and a race. A set contains only tiles of the same race, ordered in ascending or descending value. For each race, your cattle tiles are arranged in a line. New cattle tiles are added to the end of the line. When you add a tile that doesn't match the ordering of the existing set, that means that set ends and a new set is started.&#10;&#10;Obtaining cattle is done through a worker placement system. Each player has seven Gauchos which can be placed on various action spaces. The most important of these is the Pampa, where Gauchos can catch cattle (which means the player gains a new cattle tile). Other actions include stealing cattle from other players and sorting your cattle (to optimize your sets).&#10;&#10;Placing the Gauchos on an action space requires dice. Each action requires a specific value. These dice are taken from the Dice Rodeo. At the beginning of each round, the dice are rolled. During his turn, a player takes two dice from the Dice Rodeo and uses them to place his Gauchos.&#10;&#10;At the end of the round, each completed set of cattle is sold. The game ends when the cattle tiles draw pile runs out. When this happens, one more round is played, and then all cattle tiles are sold. The player who made the most money wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Toplshteyner (Yiddish for dice) Is a new dice game from the mind of Christopher Bush. Fun and fast paced, Toplshteyner can be played for money or just for fun.&#10;&#10;Object of the game: To be the last man standing!&#10;&#10;&#10;    Each player starts the game with three lives. Each life is represented by an amount of money agreed upon before the start of the game (50p or 50c a life for example). If playing for fun, just exchange the money for three of anything you can get your hands on. Poker chips, matchsticks etc.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Determine who is going to roll first by each rolling a die. The highest number rolls first.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    The first player rolls the dice. They will have either rolled a &ldquo;point&rdquo; or a &ldquo;consequence&rdquo;. All double rolls (1-1, 2-2, 3-3 etc.) are consequence rolls. Every other combination, except those that equal seven, acts as a point roll.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Consequence rolls have different effects on the game. See the &ldquo;List of Consequences&rdquo; section for full details.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    If a player rolls a point, they must attempt to re-roll that point before they roll a seven. If they manage to re-roll their point, their life is safe and the dice go to the next player. If they roll a seven, they lose a life and the dice goes to the next player. Note: Seven NEVER acts as the point. If a seven is the first number rolled, the player must continue to roll the dice until a valid point or consequence has been rolled.&#10;&#10;&#10;List of Consequences&#10;&#10;&#10;    1-1 &ldquo;Snake Eyes&rdquo; &ndash; Player loses a life. Valid only once per turn. If rolled first the player will lose a life then their point will be two. Rolling double one for the second time will save you a life, not cost you one.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    2-2 &ldquo;Saving Grace&rdquo; &ndash; Players life is safe and their turn is over. Play moves on.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    3-3 &ldquo;Threes&rdquo; &ndash; Even if a point has already been set, if 3-3 is rolled, the point is changed to six. The player must then attempt to re-roll a six before they roll a seven, but if they do so by re-rolling 3-3, ALL lives are lost and they lose the game entirely.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    4-4 &ldquo;Crazy Eight&rdquo; &ndash; Point is set or reverted to two. The player will not lose a life by rolling 1-1. But their odds of re-rolling their point before rolling a seven have vastly decreased.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    5-5 &ldquo;High Fives&rdquo; &ndash; Elect a player to lose a life. If rolled first it acts as both the point AND the consequence. Valid only once per turn.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    6-6 &ldquo;Trick Sixes&rdquo; &ndash; Extra Life to a maximum of four lives. Extra lives earned can be reclaimed from the pot if the player has less than three lives. The fourth life is optional because it must come out of the players own pocket. Note: If playing for fun, the fourth life can be taken from the pot also.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "I, Spy&nbsp;is an exciting contest of disguised intentions, political manipulation, and spy games spanning an espionage-wracked pre-war Europe. Deceive your opponents as an agent secretly working for a European power, recruiting key assets, buying off politicians, and instigating sabotage against foreign capitals. However, you will need the reluctant (or unwitting) support of your opponents to position your homeland for European domination, so tread carefully and do not reveal your true identity.&#10;&#10;Game Overview:&#10;At the start of the game, you receive an Alignment Token, which tells you which one of the competing European nations you secretly work for.&#10;&#10;The rest of the game unfolds over the course of 14 rounds, with each player (spy) performing 3 Actions per round. These actions include moving around the map, acquiring resources in the form of Supply Tokens, improving your abilities by recruiting Assets, manipulating the otherwise-random Politicians to your advantage, or even directly harassing opposing spies.&#10;&#10;But any action you take will directly affect at least one Nation, in the form of gains or losses in Influence points. Your mission during the game is to generate Influence for your own Nation, while at the same time preventing your opponents&rsquo; Nations from gaining too much&mdash;if you can deduce which Nations they are!&#10;&#10;Influence is tallied and compared during Scoring Phases, which take place at set intervals throughout the game. In a Scoring Phase, each Nation receives Power points based on how much Influence it has accumulated so far.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, players reveal their Alignment Tokens, and the player whose Nation has the most Power is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Miniature Rules for Jet Combat Over the Korean Penisula 1950-1953. Air War-Korea is the third in a line of introductory air combat games designed by David Child-Dennis. Air War-Korea is designed for 1/600th or 1/300th miniatures, although 1/144th can be used by doubling all measurements. Air War-Korea is hopefully the first in a series of games that will focus on specific eras with the second game being set in the skies over Vietnam. Theoretically this game could be played outside with 1/72nd scale models on stakes (with flags replacing the counters. This is my intention for this as it is less complex than other systems of it's kind.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;Air combat rules for 1/600, 1/300 and 1/144th miniatures for the Korean war 1950-1953.&#10;&#10;Although jets were used in WW2 and most major powers had developed them by the end of the war, there were no jet vs. jet dogfights. After the war the U.S., England, and Russia frantically improved their engines and airframes, setting the stage for what would be a continual arms race for the next forty or so years.&#10;&#10;The Mig-15 came as a shock to Western air forces when it made its debut over the skies of Korea at the start of the Korean War. The first jet to jet dogfights took place with P-80s, F-2 Banshees, and F-84s dueling it out with Mig-15s as North Korean forces attacked down the Korean peninsula, then during the disintegration of those same forces with the UN counterattacks.&#10;&#10;When the F-86 Sabre entered combat it completely changed the game and set in motion the classic duel between the Mig-15 and F-86 for the next few years.&#10;&#10;Airwar Korea is an introductory level air combat set of miniatures rules that recreates these legendary duels. Players can use F-86s, Mig-15s, carry out ground attacks, and basically any type of mission that was used in the Korean War.&#10;&#10;Airwar Korea enables gamers to read through some basic rules, set up a game, and conclude the game in a few hours without having to learn 50+ pages of rules and dozens of charts.&#10;&#10;",

The chief lieutenants of Satan, the Aspirants, have put aside all pretenses of unity and now engage in open warfare upon each other, sending forth hordes of demons and damned souls to slaughter the forces of other Aspirants, paving the way to Hell&rsquo;s throne with blood, bone, and those fiddly little pink bits that&#10;always hang off the entrails.&#10;&#10;The ultimate prize is, of course, the throne of Hell, and the license to continue Hell&rsquo;s insidious cold war against Mankind and the forces of Heaven. But only if there&rsquo;s anything left after the fighting&rsquo;s done&hellip;&#10;&#10;A 15mm/28mm skirmish game.&#10;&#10;",

A general description follows, and this will offer an overview of what actions a tabletop game covers.&#10;&#10;The Book and The Gun is a realistic small unit action war game that is easy to learn and relatively quick to play, while containing the depth needed to meet the players' desire for a realistic tactical tabletop miniatures game. Vehicles and aircraft rules have been abstracted as support for the infantry fight and to that end players should not attempt to recreate large scale mechanized actions with these rules as you will be disappointed.&#10;Players should look at how the rules can be modified to accommodate armies of these periods.&#10;&#10;There is no reason, with proper modification, why these rules cannot be used to portray small-scale infantry actions in Vietnam, Korea, and WW2. Indeed, these rules can portray small actions such SWAT rescues and police actions.&#10;&#10;So, it is present day, and anywhere in the world you want to take your fire team or squad and fight is up to you and your imagination. Collecting a large army is not necessary in order to play. All it takes is a minimum of 3 soldiers per side and a little bit of model terrain to enter the firefight of your life.&#10;&#10;1 full turn equals 2 minutes game scale. Each player turn is one minute in real time.&#10;&#10;Troop scale is basically 1 figure represents one man and one vehicle model represents one vehicle.&#10;&#10;",

Typical mats, such as those available from Hotz (Sea Blue felt mat) with 2 inch hexes generally work very well.  Alternately, players could utilize 1/600th scale ships (such as Xyston Miniatures) on an 8&rsquo; x 6&rsquo; mat with 3 or 4 inch hexes if they choose to do so.

        "description": "Lightning War is a game of warfare during the age of machinery. It is a game of strategy and tactics where battles (of perhaps more than one day) are able to be played in a few hours.&#10;The basic unit of control is the battalion (or national equivalent). This is a unit of individual bases (usually around four), where each base represents a company (or squadron of tanks). This battalion-sized unit is called a combat unit. A group of these combat units, usually two to four, is called a battle group.&#10;An example of a battle group is a British armoured brigade, where the individual armoured regiments are the combat units. The four bases within each represent the squadrons within the regiments.&#10;The focus of Lightning War is not on detail (for instance, range bands and armour penetration tables) but on troop types, the training of the soldiers involved and command control.&#10;&#10;All troops and commanders have a quality rating from one (worst) to five (best). This is not the valour of the individual soldier, but a measure of how effective they are in combat.&#10;A turn is two hours and a combat unit (battalion) can perform one or two actions a turn depending on the quality of the troops and a die roll.&#10;Battle groups move sequentially between sides &ndash; not one side after the other &ndash; depending on the quality of the troops and headquarters involved.&#10;Combat units can become fatigued once they suffer casualties and commands can become exhausted (once half the units within them are fatigued). The effects of fatigue and exhaustion are to slow or even stop advances.&#10;Bases are usually 30mm by 30mm for micro armour, but other sizes can be used. Place as many infantry figures on a base as desired (four or five seems a good number). A vehicle or gun base has one model on it.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In the most distant reaches of the world, magic still exists, embodied by spirits of the land, of the sky, and of every natural thing. As the great powers of Europe stretch their colonial empires further and further, they will inevitably lay claim to a place where spirits still hold power - and when they do, the land itself will fight back alongside the islanders who live there.&#10;&#10;Spirit Island is a complex and thematic cooperative game about defending your island home from colonizing Invaders. Players are different spirits of the land, each with its own unique elemental powers. Every turn, players simultaneously choose which of their power cards to play, paying energy to do so. Using combinations of power cards that match a spirit's elemental affinities can grant free bonus effects. Faster powers take effect immediately, before the Invaders spread and ravage, but other magics are slower, requiring forethought and planning to use effectively. In the Spirit phase, spirits gain energy, and choose how / whether to Grow: to reclaim used power cards, to seek for new power, or to spread presence into new areas of the island.&#10;&#10;The Invaders expand across the island map in a semi-predictable fashion. Each turn they explore into some lands (portions of the island); the next turn, they build in those lands, forming settlements and cities. The turn after that, they ravage there, bringing blight to the land and attacking any native islanders present.&#10;&#10;The islanders fight back against the Invaders when attacked, and lend the spirits some other aid, but may not always do so exactly as you'd hoped. Some Powers work through the islanders, helping them (eg) drive out the Invaders or clean the land of blight.&#10;&#10;The game escalates as it progresses: spirits spread their presence to new parts of the island and seek out new and more potent powers, while the Invaders step up their colonization efforts. Each turn represents 1-3 years of alternate-history.&#10;&#10;At game start, winning requires destroying every last settlement and city on the board - but as you frighten the Invaders more and more, victory becomes easier: they'll run away even if some number of settlements or cities remain. Defeat comes if any spirit is destroyed, if the island is overrun by blight, or if the Invader deck is depleted before achieving victory.&#10;&#10;The game includes different adversaries to fight against (eg: a Swedish Mining Colony, or a Remote British Colony). Each changes play in different ways, and offers a different path of difficulty boosts to keep the game challenging as you gain skill.&#10;&#10;",

This spectre does not distinguish between gods and men, all are crushed beneath the feet of what can only be called...The Cataclysm. Five great beings have formed a Covenant to halt the devastation. Battle rivals to prove that you&rsquo;re a commander that The Five need in order to stop The Cataclysm and earn your place amongst their great champions.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;The Game&#10;&#10;Phoenix Covenant is a tactics battle card game that fans have called &quot;like Magic meets Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; - and yes, you can believe them. It's far more than &quot;cards on a board;&quot; there's real strategic depth and you're not subject to mere dice rolls at every critical moment.&#10;&#10;In this universe, you are a great commander trying to prove yourself as the best of them all in a battle of wills. Outmaneuver your foes and create tactical formations by turning your cards, outwit others with well-timed unit abilities, combos and spells, and outplay opponents by taking advantage of our unique special-summoning Commander cards, directional armor and attack system, and built-right-on-the-field structure cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;More Details&#10;&#10;Commander Units allow players to forward-deploy units against opposing forces. While you can use them for their native abilities or attack power, forward-deploying can turn the tide of a battle. Position-based mechanics augment keyword-based and event-based mechanics seen in card games up to now. Some cards grow in power based on their position on the board, others might protect units next to them, and others might deflect enemy attacks.&#10;&#10;The unique square (80mm x 80mm) card units come with a combination of armor and weakpoints. Damage is reduced when a unit is attacked on an armored side, while a unit suffers a critical hit (extra damage) when hit in a weakpoint. You'll need to maneuver and turn your units to attack your enemies' unarmored sides and weakpoints while protecting your own in deadly tactical duels across the game board.&#10;&#10;In the Player vs. Player (PvP) head-to-head mode, you test your tactical and strategic might against everyone at once. Choose your army well, learn spells, and consider constructing powerful structures to support your forces. There is also a 2v2 team battle mode for all out there who want to test their skills while bringing a friend along for the fight!&#10;&#10;A Player vs. Environment (PvE) cooperative mode is under development, and multiple scenarios are being tested. With it, you will play alongside friends and take on missions that The Five require you and other great commanders to complete. You may even be able to design your own scenarios.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Each turn, players simultaneously select one card from their hand of seven cards. The player with the winning card advances the soccer ball on the play field, with the ball moving back and forth until one player scores. After a duel, each player draws back up to seven cards.&#10;&#10;This game is a reimplementation of Reiner Knizia's other soccer-themed card-game, Tor, with many important differences:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Instead of 13 cards (values 1-13), both players have 15 cards (with numerous differences from the original game). These include one &quot;Tor&quot; (goalkeeper) card that blocks movement of the ball, one &quot;0&quot; card that beats a &quot;7&quot;, and 12 cards with the values 2-7 (two of each). The &quot;5&quot; card has a special power: when they are played, the lower card wins.&#10;     In the original, players had all their cards in hand. In this version they only have 7 cards in-hand and refill their hand back to 7 once their turn is over.&#10;     If two equal cards are played, the ball is not moved, but the given duel is not resolved yet. Both players choose another card until one player wins and then the ball moves in the winning direction as many fields as the number of cards played by the player.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

They arm mighty weapons to bases and set out cheese to attract different mice ranging from the mundane to the fantastic.&#10;&#10;The first hunter to catch all the mice on his list wins.&#10;&#10;During their turn a hunter rolls a die to determine, which mouse they attracted. A second die roll will determine, if the trap trap is strong enough to catch the mouse. Weapons, bases, bait and location will modify the attraction and catch rolls. Catching a mouse will get you a bounty, but if you miss other hunters at the location will have a shot at catching the same mouse.&#10;&#10;Use the bounty to buy improved weapons, better bait and travel the kingdom to complete your hunting assignment.&#10;&#10;",

The premise is that in this period, Colonels were, in effect private military contractors to the state &ndash; contracted to provide a battalion for the King.&#10;The game is a development of an original idea developed by Brian Cameron and Jim Wallman in June 1996 and subsequently played by the enthusiastic members of the Chestnut Lodge Wargames Group.&#10;&#10;Background&#10;&#10;The British Army in this period (the date is deliberately not specified, it is &ldquo;Seventeen forty-something&rdquo;) consists of a variable number of regiments (usually 50 - 60) each of which is normally a single battalion.&#10;&#10;For administrative purposes each battalion consists of 10 companies, 9 centre and 1 grenadier. In effect the colonel owns the regiment and is paid by the government to recruit and maintain it.&#10;Each player makes up a character name for their Colonel. This is, in many respects, a roleplaying game, so players are encouraged to define such things as age, marital social status, background and previous military experience (which is not required to hold a colonelcy). If in doubt about what the period was like watch the film Barry Lyndon.&#10;&#10;The colonel should be regarded as being the player in person &ndash; so risk to the colonel in battle is risk to the player.&#10;&#10;",

These include:&#10;&#10;    The use of a standard pack of playing cards to determine the order in which units are able to move, fire, and take part in close combat;&#10;    The use of Special Event Cards that the players can use to gain extra movement, firepower, close combat effectiveness, or to rally troops that have failed a morale test and have fled from the battlefield;&#10;    The use of the Jokers to determine:&#10;        When players have to hand back any unused Special Event Cards.&#10;        When the battle will end.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Ultimate Werewolf is an interactive game of deduction for two teams: Villagers and Werewolves. The Villagers don't know who the Werewolves are, and the Werewolves are trying to remain undiscovered while they slowly eliminate the Villagers one at a time. A Moderator (who isn't on a team) runs the game.&#10;&#10;Ultimate Werewolf takes place over a series of game days and nights. Each day, the players discuss who among them is a Werewolf and vote out a player. Each night, the Werewolves choose a player to eliminate, while the Seer learns whether one player is a Werewolf or not. The game is over when either all the Villagers or all the Werewolves are eliminated.&#10;&#10;Ultimate Werewolf: Deluxe Edition features all new artwork, a great new design, totally rewritten and more comprehensive rules, and an even better moderator scorepad. What's more, it supports more players than ever: 75 of your closest friends can converge on one or more villages using the components in this box.&#10;&#10;Ultimate Werewolf: Deluxe Edition For Kickstarter adds 20 bonus cards unlocked during the Kickstarter campaign beyond the retail deluxe edition - Deluxe Edition versions of all the existing Ultimate Werewolf expansions to date (except Artifacts), including the new Wolf Pack cards. It also included a deeper box that allows the cards to be stood on their side.&#10;&#10;",

The name of the game is the strategic plan given by the adviser of Shu to his King at the place called Long Zhong.&#10;&#10;In this game, players can play the roles of one of the three major States or as misc. warlords power.  A player can take two actions each turn.  The options for the actions include:&#10;1. occupy neutral city;&#10;2. transfer of armies;&#10;3. recruit armies;&#10;4. attack an enemy city; or&#10;5. use a strategy card.&#10;&#10;Players would vie for control of different cities on the game board, with their General and Army cards, the exact contents of which are hidden from the view of other players to create a fog of war.  The bulk of the game lies in the action of &quot;attack an enemy city&quot;, where two players would lay down their Army cards in formation and reveal them at the same to compare the strength and decide the outcome of the battle.&#10;&#10;The first player who conquers all other capitals is the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;",

The &lsquo;Initiating Player&rsquo; commences their game turn by selecting a particular command (usually a Company or Squadron) and then attempts to move and fire it in order to attain their game objective(s). The game turn is relinquished to the opposing player immediately the current &lsquo;initiating player&rsquo;s&rsquo; selected command fails a morale test. If the command passes a required morale test it continues to move and or fire until it either completes its current orders or fails a subsequent morale test. Command Morale tests are always carried out immediately a platoon is disabled. Once the currently selected command completes all the tasks the initiating player requires of it and it passes all required morale tests, the player may select another command to move and fight or they may relinquish the initiative to the opposing player.&#10;&#10;Constructing a force&#10;Both players begin the game with 6 command headquarters of any type within their selected country organisation. Once the types of commands are established, each player rolls 2D6 for each command and this represents the number of platoons or batteries contained in each&#10;command. If larger forces are required, players keep adding blocks of command headquarters as required. Commands may not exceed their T&amp;OE strengths.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The intent of this small set of wargaming rules is to allow the players to recreate a portion of this battle using miniature figures, scenery and models. Unlike most wargaming rules, all the players in Mog &rsquo;93 play the American forces. The Somalis run themselves on &lsquo;auto-pilot&rsquo;, using a simple scheme of die rolls&#10;to determine where they appear and their actions. The Americans check to see if they get hit any time they perform an action based on the number of armed Somalis who have LOS. These rules assume that&#10;you have some basic wargaming experience, as I have no inclination to write out wargaming basics such as what LOS is and what does and does not constitute cover, etc.&#10;&#10;The author&rsquo;s basic scenario assumes that the initial stage of the mission is complete: The Delta operators have captured and secured the targets, who have been loaded on the vehicles and sent off on their way back to base. The first Blackhawk has been shot down and crashed. At the beginning of play, Rangers and Delta Operators (and SEAL and air force personnel as well, if you have the figures) are on the ground, trying to make their way to secure the crash site and prepare for extraction. What happens from there is up to the players and the dice.&#10;&#10;Each player will control a &lsquo;unit&rsquo; of American special forces soldiers, typically either a unit of Delta operators or Rangers. The term &lsquo;unit&rsquo; is used because you&rsquo;ll have to decide how many models will form a unit &ndash; it can be as large a stick of Rangers (12 models), to as few as two models each if you have a lot of players. My advice to you is to allow each player 4 to 6 models, maximum, as he will need to keep track of ammunition and wounds for each model.&#10;The Somalis will come into play as &lsquo;mobs&rsquo;. A mob will consist of one or more Somali models, armed, unarmed, or a mixture of both. The Somalis are on autopilot. They are moved according to a protocol described herein, but otherwise perform no actions other than to be on the battlefield, assuming to be firing in whatever direction they are facing at any Americans who happen to be in their LOS.&#10;&#10;",

Next players look at their hand for any sixes not in their trump suit, these are to be given to the player who has that suit as trumps.&#10;&#10;The game is played in three rounds; keep scores for each of the rounds.&#10;&#10;The Play &ndash; Playing clockwise, the player to the dealers left starts by playing any card from their hand face up to the center of the playing area forming the start of a play stack.&#10;&#10;Henceforth on your turn take one of the following actions:&#10;&#10;1. Beat the top card of the play stack by playing a higher-ranking card of the same color suit or&#10;&#10;2. Play one of your trump cards on top of the play stack.

Play a card that is not one of your trump cards to the playing area forming a second play stack adjacent to the previous one, the card must be of a different color suit from the one previously lead.

Now all the cards of the previous play stack go to the previous player and kept face down.&#10;&#10;When a player is unable to take her turn, she must pass and the stack of cards go to the previous player. If all players pass in succession the game ends.&#10;&#10;Scoring &ndash; At the end of each round add up all the cards you&rsquo;ve taken, these are worth 1 point each and then subtract 1 point each for every card left in your hand. Tally each players final scores from all three rounds, the player with the highest score is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

The rules cover the period from when all European nations adopted the three-man-deep platoon firing system up until the rise of the mass conscript armies of the Napoleonic era; very roughly A.D. 1740-1790, when musketry weight of fire ruled the battlefield. The rules do not try to recreate every aspect of 18th Century warfare; for example, the rules ignore most of the complexities of maneuver.&#10;&#10;The rules are intended only to model the &ldquo;classic&rdquo; tactics of the period.&#10;&#10;The rules are designed for games using 6-12 units per side. A game like this should take about four hours for a pair of opponents familiar with the rules to complete. Typical game setup involves two fairly equal forces facing one another across a game table laid out with terrain models representing hills, woods, streams, etc. Victory conditions to win the game may vary widely, but usually one player wins when a stated number of the enemy&rsquo;s units have been destroyed or routed off the game table before a set number of turns have been played.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Voice of the Guns is a wargames system for European Land Warfare for the period from 1850, when the muzzle-loading rifle became widely adopted, to 1916, when the tank made its appearance on the European battlefield. In that time the cavalry lost its pre-eminence on the battlefield, the artillery developed the art of indirect fire thanks to the introduction of the recoil mechanism, and the machine-gun evolved into a weapon to fear.&#10;&#10;The period runs from the Crimean War, up through the wars of Italian Unification, the Austro-Prussian and Franco Prussian Wars, the Russo-Turkish War and on to the early days of the First World War. The system may also be successfully used to re-fight the American Civil War and the Russo-Japanese War of 1904.&#10;&#10;The system is intended for large-scale actions up to corps and army level. The basic manoeuvre units are the infantry battalion, the cav&#10;alry squadron and the artillery battery. With the possible exception of independent machine-gun companies, further subdivision of forces is not considered.&#10;&#10;The system may be used for any scale of figures from 5-6 mm through 10-12 mm and 15 mm up to 25-28 mm and is not dependent upon specific numbers of figures per unit.&#10;&#10;Morale and combat systems have been streamlined to cut down calculation as far as feasible. Where possible, outcomes are automatic. While at the same time, command and control is sophisticated and designed to present players with the sort of tactical and practical problems encountered by real-life generals.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "One of the great &ldquo;what ifs&rdquo; of the Second World War involves Germany surviving long enough to field a large force of operational jets. By the end of the war the Me-262 and Me-163 had been operational for awhile and there were many others either in the experimental stage or on the design board.&#10;&#10;Jet bombers escorted by jet fighters were certainly not out of the question if the war had gone late into 1945 or early 1946.&#10;But the Allies weren&rsquo;t exactly unprepared either. Several of their jet designs were approaching the operational stage and could have&#10;set the scene for some fascinating jet battles over Germany.&#10;P-80s escorting B- 29s that are intercepted by a variety of German jets is just one of the many scenarios that these rules will allow&#10;you to simulate.&#10;&#10;Dawning of the Jet Age allows gamers to recreate these hypothetical battles as Allied jets try to counter the German jet fighters already in operation. Like many other games in this series,&#10;these rules are designed for a fun and fast game as the basic rules are only a few pages. Gamers should be able to grasp the concepts&#10;and be flying in no time at all and the system can also work for large, multiplayer games.&#10;&#10;Feel free to add additional rules, jets, or other WW2 prop driven aircraft to your scenarios. The rules are flexible enough that a little more complexity can be added without loss of playability or more time needed to finish a game.&#10;&#10;Dawning of the Jet Age is designed for 1/600th or 1/300th miniatures, although 1/144th can be used by doubling all measurements.&#10;&#10;",

Players attempt to cooperatively complete 10 adventures in order to become Legends. To do so, all the players must work together to defeat Monsters along the way. Each time you play is unique, and the game is enhanced by magnificent fantasy artwork.&#10;&#10;To play Legends of Adventure, players become Heroes of different types and go forth to undertake up to 10 adventures. To complete each adventure, the Heroes must defeat a group of Monsters equal in number to the number of players.  The assorted adventures and the Monsters provide circumstances and powers that modify game play. In order to defeat the Monsters and complete each adventure, the players must jointly outscore the Monsters&rsquo; combined level. This is done by rolling unique dice, featuring water, fire, and forest icons, for the levels of Heroes and Treasure Cards played, as well as playing Divine Intervention cards, adding an interesting spin that allows Heroes to request help from the gods. Each successful die roll adds to the overall score of the Heroes; once the Heroes have defeated the Monsters, they receive loot in the form of Treasure Cards that will help them in future adventures. The variety of cards provides different scenarios not only for all adventures but also for each game as a whole.&#10;&#10;",

The goal of the game is to collect a pie in each color. The colors correspond to different question categories.&#10;&#10;The board consists of a circular track with spaces in seven different colors. Six of the colors correspond to question categories while the last color gives a new dice roll. Six spaces along the track are &quot;pie spaces&quot;, and from these there are &quot;spokes&quot; of track leading to the middle of the board.&#10;&#10;Players roll a die and move along the track in any direction they like. When a player stops on a color they get a question of the appropriate category. If the player answers a question correctly while on a pie space, they get a pie of that color (assuming they don't already have it). A correct answer on another square allows the player to roll again.&#10;&#10;Once the player has one pie in each color, she can move along the spokes to the middle of the board to win the game.&#10;&#10;",

It&rsquo;s a mismanaged, third-tier agency owned by the slick Mr. Loop, who cares more about making a buck than making sure the delicate weave of the time-space continuum stays tight and safe. For you and your coworkers, it&rsquo;s as good as job as any, and if you time things just right you may even get a nice bonus at the end of the day. And since you have a time machine, you can take multiple cracks at it&hellip; assuming things don&rsquo;t get too chaotic with your past selves running around.&#10;&#10;Loop Inc. is played over the course of three days, with each day actually being the same day, but a different time through it. During the first day, players will get to perform three actions and send out their one time machine. Actions include gathering components, setting up advertising, and more. Then, at the end of the day, players jump into their time machines and return to the beginning to start the day over again. The catch is, when players go back in time to try the day again, their past selves are still running around. This means they&rsquo;ll have to perform all the actions from the previous version of the day, as well as three new ones. They&rsquo;ll also have an additional ship to launch. On the third try, things compound even further...making timing key. At the end of the third day, the player who completed the most profitable trips wins, provided they didn&rsquo;t cause too many tears in the space time continuum.&#10;&#10;",

As you piece the map together you are drawn into the turbulent times of the Han dynasty in a land of mystical kingdoms. Take the role of the legendary warlords,found in Luo Guanzhong&rsquo;s epic tale, &ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms.&rdquo; Capture lands and build castles to extend and defend your kingdom.&#10;&#10;Cartography is a land claiming game with a twist, players become mapmakers in a game that takes creativity and foresight to claim land on a map that changes with each turn. Cartography builds on the ancient territory claiming game &quot;Go&quot; by adding a map-making mechanism. The map is made up of triangular tiles, with rivers that divide the map, allowing lands to be defended or captured. Players create and claim land, then capture opponents, in an effort to control the map.&#10;&#10;The map changes as you play so you must keep your wits about you.&#10;&#10;Players start by selecting tiles to create land and extend the map.  Castles are then placed on the land you claim or capture, and whoever has most castles &ndash; those they place on the land and those they capture &ndash; wins.  Because the landscape changes on every turn, you must be vigilant as a stronghold can quickly turn into a weakness, and as you try to surround other players&rsquo; castles, they might also be surrounding you! In planning your strategy on where to build your castles, you must carefully choose between expanding and consolidating, and between attacking and defending.&#10;&#10;Strategy is key and chance doesn't determine the winner. The 2nd Edition features an alternative play option with an element of luck through random draw of three land tiles kept hidden in your hand.&#10;&#10;Cartography is a Social Abstract Game SAG for 2 to 4 players.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Captains Bold is a game in which the players take the part of a frigate Captain involved in ship-to-ship combat during the height of the Age of Fighting Sail. In the process of playing the game, the players consider the types of tactical decisions made by their historical counterparts and explore the ways in which those decisions may have affected the outcome of single ship combats of that time.&#10;&#10;The movement and combat systems in the game have been deliberately kept simple and somewhat stylized, in order not to distract the player from the commander's decision-making process with details and decisions that would typically have fallen within the purview of his&#10;subordinates. Likewise, the specifications of the vessels themselves have been abstracted to avoid making the game too much about the hardware.&#10;&#10;The game takes place on a playing area consisting of hexagonal tiles which have a triangular grid superimposed upon them, with lighter colored dots at the vertices. The ships are represented on the playing area by counters, flats or miniatures, and move from dot to dot (referred to in the rules as &quot;points&quot;) along the gray lines of the grid.&#10;&#10;Most of the components of the game are included in the files which comprise the game.&#10;&#10;",

I hope my small contribution provides something you will enjoy.&#10;&#10;Players will find that the emphasis had been placed on the American War of Independence and American Civil War. This was done to get the particular troop types of that conflict vetted in these rules. There is no reason why these rules cannot suffice for any European war of the same period.&#10;&#10;A basic set of war game rules must provide a vehicle for troop movement, a procedure for deciding combat and a method for accounting for the results of combat (casualties and routed units). Laid over all this, the war gamer must be confounded with command and control issues and logistics problems. All this must be done without unduly complicating the rule system and maintaining game playability and realism.&#10;&#10;",

This allowed players &ndash; who adopted the roles of leaders of particular tribes &ndash; to submit special orders with their turns, instructions which were processed by a human being and could thus include any action imaginable rather than being restricted by a predesigned set of rules. This flexibility, combined with occasional opportunities to enact the role of a particular individual rather than that of an entire clan and the potential for games to continue indefinitely, made Crane&lsquo;s game play resemble that of a tabletop role playing game far more closely than that of a board and counter war game.&#10;&#10;",

The only problem is that your opponents are doing the very same thing! Each gallery must be organized properly by exhibit number, but to succeed you must balance your passion for order with the need for public acclaim. Impress visitors by tastefully positioning works of art side-by-side showing similar themes. Make sure you don't get too greedy for applause, though &mdash; doing so might disorganize your collection and keep you from displaying any more paintings. The first player to complete each separate gallery will open the exhibition early and receive extra recognition. The player who displays the most compelling combination of artworks in the most artistic manner wins.&#10;&#10;Mus&eacute;e includes sixty unique fine art images from artists ranging from the fifteenth to the early twentieth centuries, all licensed through Bridgeman Art Library.&#10;&#10;",

The game map would stretch from Algeria to Iraq, and include strategic islands such as Malta and Crete. Ground units would be divisions, air units groups, and naval units at the squadron level. German divisions can break down into kampfgruppen. Armored units can employ special post combat movement rules, depending on their level of mobility. Special operations units will include the Long Range Desert Group, the Brandenburgers, and Italian naval commandos. Players can consult an Appeal to the High Command Table which may bring in additional reinforcements, or trigger loyalty changes in Vichy forces, or trigger the Iraqi coup. There will also be variable scenarios depending on the level of force commitment by both sides. Special rules will let the Axis build their Operation Herkules force to invade Malta, while the British can reorganize their forces for more efficient operations. Event chits will include the impact of ULTRA, American intervention (everything from carriers in the Med to Operation Torch), and leaders such as Rommel, O&rsquo;Conner, Montgomery and Patton.&#10;&#10;Components: Two 22&quot; x 34&quot; maps &amp; 560 counters&#10;&#10;",

They are striving for fortune and fame in a competition hosted by a legendary magician, looking for a successor worthy of the mighty Trickerion Stone, which is fabled to grant supernatural power to its owner.&#10;&#10;Using worker placement and simultaneous action selection mechanisms, the Illusionists and their teams of helpers &mdash; the Engineer, the Assistant, the Manager, and a handful of Apprentices &ndash; obtain blueprints and components for increasingly complex magic tricks, expand the team and set up performances by visiting the Downtown, Dark Alley, Market Row and Theater locations on the main game board depicting a late 19th century cityscape.&#10;&#10;The tricks are stored and prepared on the Magician's own Workshop game board, while the performances themselves take place at the Theater in the form of a tile placement mini-game with lots of player interaction. The performances yield Fame points and Coins to their owners based on the tricks they consist of. Fame points have multiple uses, but they also serve as a win condition - After turn 7, when the last Performance card is revealed, the game ends and the illusionist with the most Fame points wins.&#10;&#10;The game offers 48 different Tricks to be learned from the Optical, Spiritual, Mechanical and Escape categories, over 90 character abilities, and 40 Special Assignment cards that influence the actions taken at the various game locations. The base game can be expanded with two optional rule modules to add further strategic depth to the game.&#10;&#10;The &quot;Dark Alley&quot; expansion included in the base game adds a new location to the game. It also comes with 48 new Special Assignment cards, a new tier of Tricks, and 27 Prophecy tokens that can alter certain game rules turn by turn, giving the game additional variety.&#10;&#10;",

The game covers the critical period of Viet Minh assaults and French counterattacks of March to May, 1954. Historically, the Viet Minh won the battle, overrunning the base. This led to the collapse of the French position in Indochina and eventual US involvement in Vietnam.&#10;&#10;In Dien Bien Phu, you play the French while the game system controls the Viet Minh. The objective is for the French to hold out long enough for the fortress to be relieved, or even gain a decisive victory by breaking Viet Minh morale.&#10;&#10;While a solitaire game, Dien Bien Phu can also be played by two or more players, each taking charge of different aspects of the French defense. For example, one player can be overall commander, while others command various defensive sectors, or take charge of air and artillery.&#10;&#10;Modern War #17, May-June 2015.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "More than just a simple compilation of the four books in the Strike Legion Tactical series (the award-winning Strike Legion Main Rulebook, Module 1: The Genome Gambit, Module 2: The Clockwork Armies and Skunk Works), the Strike Legion Tactical Rules Compendium contains one of the most complete game systems available on the market today for playing &lsquo;hard&rsquo; Science Fiction or Science Fantasy miniatures battles using small-scale miniatures (2mm to 15mm).&#10;&#10;While the easy-to-learn core game rules and procedures (including Strike Legion&rsquo;s unique, integrated Electronic Warfare system) have not changed from their original versions, many of the procedures around those core rules have been simplified or standardized. All of the various weapons and systems whose use was formerly tracked using check boxes on unit Data Cards have been modified to simple (Depletion or Usage) die roll functions, obviating the need for most written records during game play, and many other sections have been edited or re-written for better clarity and ease of implementation.&#10;&#10;Every section of each rulebook has been collated and consolidated into a unified whole, with all related rules being found in their respective sections. Some of the rules, vehicle systems and infantry attributes have been removed or consolidated to single entries to avoid redundancies, and a few new rules and options have been added for those wishing to implement them.&#10;&#10;Each section that has been significantly altered has been marked so that veteran players will quickly be able to grasp the differences and improvements in how the game is played. While the Strike Legion Tactical Rules Compendium is not written in a progressive learning format, sections that are not critical for new players to learn before their first game are also clearly marked, allowing them to begin their first game in short order.&#10;&#10;Additional game features include:&#10;&#10;6 general scenarios playable with any forces, with some scenarios offering significant suggested variants to change the nature and scope of the action&#10;100 pre-designed unit Data Cards representing the four human and two non-human factions involved in humanity&rsquo;s First Secession War, along with organizational charts for each faction.&#10;A revised Unit Construction section that allows players to create their own forces ranging from savages with bows and spears to genetically modified (or grown) troops and bio-mechanical vehicles, from historically-based armies representing any period (including the modern or alternate Victorian eras) in recorded history to the wildest (or strangest) visions of combat in the far future taken from the players&rsquo; favorite SciFi novels, TV shows, or films&#10;New options for Overwatch order resolution, Air Strikes, and Stomp attacks by Walkers and Large Organic elements&#10;Rules for solitaire play&#10;Revised graphics for all Data Cards and informational markers, including edit-enabled blank Data Card PDF forms for players wishing to field their own unit creations.&#10;Revised game reference charts that include all of the &lsquo;basic&rsquo; To Hit, Hit Location, Terrain, Damage, Infantry Combat, and Crew Quality Test procedures and modifiers&#10;The scope and scale of combat in Strike Legion Tactical have not changed: a player&rsquo;s forces are grouped into platoons of 2 to 4 individual squad, guns, or vehicles and each player can easily handle a reinforced battalion on the tabletop.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Galaxy of Trian is a dynamic tile-based sci-fi board game. During the game you take command over one of a few opposing races, fighting over a territory and technology left by a powerful race Trian. You have at your disposal few kinds of basic units and spaceships allowing a great deal of interaction. Different types of ships will come with the new add-ons. Tiles are two-sided and stacked into two piles during the game, which gives more tactical possibilities and, at the same time, limits randomness. Special tiles, like teleport, exmitter or trade station increase level of interaction and give even more tactical possibilities.&#10;&#10;We made all possible efforts to give the game its unique, individual character and to distinguish it from others with the specific elements of game mechanisms. The goal was to make a game, which could be different each time it is played. Moreover, it was important that during the match players could decide which game variants they want to play, taking into account variable add-ons. Every add-on is a &ldquo;module&rdquo;, which can be combined with the basic version of the game and used to make your own variants. Basic version can be combined with any number of add-ons.&#10;&#10;We wanted the game to be dynamic, with the playtime of about 60 min. We reached said time playing the strategic variant with the add-on &ldquo;Beginning of Conquer&rdquo;, which really pleases us. In the deluxe version, the game is composed of 84 beautifully illustrated, two sided tiles with 168 diverse graphics. There are no two identical graphics in the game; every nebula, planet and gas looks unique.&#10;&#10;GAME MECHANICS AND RULES:&#10;&#10;The matches are played in turns, which take place in a clockwise manner. Starting with the first player, every subsequent draws a tile in their turn and places it on the table. This way, planetary systems, nebulas and space (in which the spaceships travel) of different sizes are created. From nebulas we receive a certain amount of resources (crystals) every turn. The basic unit of the game is an emissary, who can fight over nebulas and planetary systems. If the system is won over, the emissary is able to take control of the research stations left by the Trian race. Stations can be leveled up. The points in the game can be obtained in various ways. By means of: closing planetary systems, nebulas, and space; leveling up the stations on nebulas and collecting resources (crystals) from them; conducting research or fights between ships. Game mechanics allow the application of different strategies and tactics. The game also includes tiles allowing special actions.&#10;&#10;What defines Galaxy of Trian:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Simple rules which can be explained within few minutes, using clear, illustrated game instruction&#10;    Brilliant game mechanics, which will charm everyone and provide a great number of possible tactics and strategies. The game is incredibly exciting, it offers many ways to win and a great deal of interaction between players&#10;    Smooth and dynamic matches, without tie-ups and lengthy waiting for your turn. Match lasts 45 &ndash; 60 min.&#10;    Game variants adjusted to players age and expectations&#10;    As one of a few board games it is great for two, three and four players&#10;    Beautiful graphics made with great care and attention to details&#10;    Tiles construction allows countless combinations. Each time a completely different-looking fragment of the galaxy is formed. You will return to the Galaxy of Trian frequently. Simply, this game is never boring!&#10;&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Beyond the Rhine: The Campaign for Northwest Europe, September 1944 - April 1945, begins with the German Army reeling from a string of near-fatal defeats, and in full retreat to the safety of the West Wall where it hopes to make a stand. The Allies, flush with victory, believe one more push will bring them home for Christmas.&#10;&#10;The expected walk-over was not to be, and players will find either army a challenge to command. Allied material superiority is (mostly) balanced by German tenacity, rugged terrain, and lousy weather. Defensive-minded players will be happiest playing the Germans, but players of all temperaments will discover that there is still plenty of torque left in the Axis even at this late stage of the war. The Allies will not cross the Rhine without a tough fight!&#10;&#10;Beyond the Rhine is a big game, with 3.5-mile hexes, 3.5-day turns, and counters for units from battalions up to divisions. At this scale the various Western Front battles&mdash;Market-Garden, H&uuml;rtgen, Bulge, Nordwind, Remagen, etc.&mdash;have an operational ebb and flow, but can also be viewed in relation to the whole front. A comprehensive game like this one, covering the entire Western Front, was long overdue.&#10;&#10;Special rules in this 14th game of the Operational Combat Series have been carefully designed to recreate this fascinating campaign. They include:&#10;&#10;Random events similar to what are found in the award-winning DAK. These cover things like Fuel Shortages, Arty Ammo Stockpiles, Lost Couriers, Railway Strikes, and Dambuster Raids. The 58 possible events add a lot of historical flavor but require very little rules overhead.&#10;The importance and difficulty of the Rhine crossings are distilled into rules allowing the bridges to be blown and repaired, and pontoons to be emplaced.&#10;Background effects of Allied air interdiction are simple and elegant (built into the Terrain Effects Chart and Weather), but the player does have the option to switch some of these planes to normal barrages and sweeps.&#10;The strategic significance of the Ruhr and the Saar, of clearing the left bank of the Rhine, and of major ports such as Antwerp are reflected by simple economic effects and the game&rsquo;s &ldquo;Broadfront&rdquo; restrictions on US supply placement and usage.&#10;The Wacht am Rhein counter-offensive is recreated by simple mechanics for off-map buildup and operational surprise.&#10;Many options are included for players wanting even more realism. For instance, there are rules for German Kampfgruppen and extra restrictions on the plethora of Allied independent units.&#10;Beyond the Rhine features three monster-sized campaigns that use a 44x66-inch map layout and over 1,000 combat units. Also included are several smaller scenarios, including a 9-turn Bulge game played on a special map (otherwise, portions of all four maps would be needed).&#10;&#10;Grand Campaign: 4 maps, 70 turns&#10;Fall of &lsquo;44 (Montgomery): 2 maps, 26 turns&#10;Fall of &lsquo;44 (Bradley): 2 maps, 26 turns&#10;Operation Queen: 1 map, 9 turns&#10;Bulge Campaign: 4 maps, 40 turns&#10;A Time for Trumpets: 1 map, 9 turns&#10;Nordwind: 1 map, 13 turns&#10;Endkampf Campaign: 4 maps, 24 turns&#10;Spring of &lsquo;45 (Montgomery): 2 maps, 24 turns&#10;Spring of &lsquo;45 (Bradley): 2 maps, 24 turns.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 1/2 Week&#10;Hex: 3.5 miles / 5.6 Km &#10;Units: Company to Corps&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;Five 22&quot; X 34&quot; mapsheets&#10;Eight countersheets (2,240 1/2&quot; dual-side printed counters)&#10;One 48 page OCS rules booklet&#10;One 64 page Beyond the Rhine game rules booklet&#10;Two 4 page OCS Charts &amp; Tables folders&#10;Two 8 page Beyond the Rhine Charts &amp; Tables folders (one each for Allied &amp; Axis)&#10;Three Player Aid Cards (1 sided)&#10;Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;",

Scarier still, our most steadfast allies could change sides at any time, because this new breed of vampirism is spread not by bite but by virus, activating junk DNA in its victim, and converting them to vampire. Take command of the included 120 highly detailed sculpted miniatures and battle to save the world, but be careful, players who fight by your side in one round may be at your throat in the next, because in V-Wars, the virus is always spreading.&#10;&#10;V-Wars begins as a co-operative game, but shifts as players reveal themselves to be vampires or the virus takes hold in infected players and forces them to change sides mid-game.&#10;&#10;In V-Wars, the vampires are trying to infiltrate the world's governments, taking over human cities while simultaneously attempting to sway public sympathy to recognize them as victims of a viral outbreak, not just cold-blooded killers. Meanwhile, the humans are trying to stem the vampire tide, fighting back against their covert attacks and outright rebellions.&#10;&#10;The vampires win immediately when they've reached a balance of city control and public sympathy to a point where their Victory marker and Sympathy markers reach each other on the Vampire Victory track or, alternatively, engage in a holding action long enough to exhaust all Player cards. Humans win by placing six cities under Martial Law in different regions of the world or if the vampires' Sympathy tokens are reduced to zero on the Vampire Victory track.&#10;&#10;",

Every time the die is rolled, the player must stake money to do so, and if a loss occurs the money is lost to the bank or opponent when challenging for an already-owned state.&#10;&#10;Players have a supply of map markers equal to the number of states they must win (15 or 20) and must leave one of these as a deposit with the bank if they take out a loan; therefore it is impossible to win with loans outstanding but as loans are repaid with interest it is necessary to defeat opponents who challenge for your states and therefore end up paying you the money they stake.&#10;&#10;Interestingly the game defines the Aleutian Islands as one of the &quot;states&quot; to be won, in addition to the 50 usual states (the District of Columbia is not treated as a state, unlike many similar games).&#10;&#10;",

They send their family members, or minions, to do their bidding and accomplish important tasks for the family. Players compete against each other to become the most prestigious family by rebuilding the city, defending from raiders, and outsmarting their opponents.&#10;&#10;Badlands is a game involving simultaneous selection of actions, represented by minions cards, which can each be used up to once a round. These actions are taken in the order specified on the cards, and interact with each other in a way that provides players with strong opportunities for counter-play. The key to success is being able to predict which actions your opponents will select and profiting from them.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "From the Avalanche Press website:&#10;&#10;While the campaign in Flanders turned into a bloody struggle in which hundreds of thousands died for a few feet of shattered earth, the Allied Powers sought new fronts on which they might have more success. A series of major offensives in Ottoman-ruled Palestine began in the fall of 1916. After some early failures the Allies steadily moved forward, their advance culminating in the capture of Damascus in October 1918.&#10;&#10;Lawrence of Arabia is a stand-alone game in the Infantry Attacks series, our World War One equivalent to the long-running Panzer Grenadier series. Units are companies and squadrons, and the sixty scenarios represent actions from the campaigns in the Sinai Peninsula and Palestine between 1915 and 1918, with the Ottoman Turkish army on one side supported by German and Austro-Hungarian detachments, and the British on the other supported by Australian, New Zealand, Jewish, Arab, Indian and West Indian forces.&#10;&#10;The pieces are the fantastic, tile-thick laser-cut type seen in Kursk: Burning Tigers and Korean War: Pusan Perimeter. They're just plain fun to handle, and have no scorching or soot like some laser-cut game pieces. These are the best wargame counters ever made.&#10;&#10;There are six semi-rigid mapboards, the same type found in Panzer Grenadier games. They are fully compatible with the Panzer Grenadier boards &mdash; you can play scenarios from either series on mapboards from the other game system.&#10;&#10;",

Using your hand of cards, you move these characters to the different businesses to earn bucks in the gambling business, smuggle alcohol, or act as a film industry mogul. You can move not only your own character, but also those of your opponents to mess up their strategy.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player has two options. Either play one of the four movement cards and move one of the eight characters, or play a card face down and take another character card from the middle of the table. Through the skillful placement of their characters, the players get money based on the street and business of their representative. And money is everything in Scheffeln! The winner is determined after one of the business spaces is empty of money.&#10;&#10;Also included is the variant Speed Scheffeln. Up to 7 players may compete. 7 movement cards are revealed and players must determine, as fast as possible, which character will earn the most money after the movement cards are evaluated. Think quickly, and you'll be able to choose the best character. Too slow, and you'll be stuck picking from the leftovers!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Late Summer, 54 BC:  In a series of brilliant and brutal campaigns, Caesar has seized Gaul for Rome. But not all tribes rest subdued. In the north, the Belgic leader Ambiorix springs a trap on unwary legions while Caesar is away. In the south, an ambitious son of the Arverni seeks to unite a Celtic confederation in revolt against the hated Romans. And what of the influential Aedui? Their republic appears content to shelter under Roman protection &ndash; but can they be trusted any further than any other Gauls? Meanwhile, along the Rhine, Germanic warbands multiply...&#10;&#10;Falling Sky: The Gallic Revolt Against Caesar, formerly Gallic War, takes 1 to 4 players into the military actions and complex politics of Roman-occupied but not-yet-conquered Gaul. Caesar and his hard-hitting legions cannot be everywhere and will not triumph without powerful allies among local tribes. But each Gallic confederation has its own agenda and must keep its eyes not only on the Romans but also on Celtic, Belgic, and Germanic rivals. Players recruit forces, rally allies, husband resources for war, and balance dispersed action with the effectiveness and risk of concentrated battle.&#10;&#10;Leveraging GMT's popular COIN Series system to integrate historical events with wide-ranging strategic options across the game board, Falling Sky provides accessible and deep historical gaming of war, politics, and diplomacy. A full solitaire system enables solo players to test their skill against an array of game-run factions, each unique. From Britannia to the Rhenus and down to Provincia, armies are on the move. Who shall finally subdue Gaul?&#10;&#10;Players: 1-4 (full solitaire system)&#10;Map:  Area movement&#10;Time scale:  1 year per 15-card campaign&#10;&#10;Designers:  Volko Ruhnke and Andrew Ruhnke&#10;Series Developer: Mike Bertucelli&#10;&#10;(source: GMT website, updated here by designer)&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "From the Avalanche Press website:&#10;&#10;Having driven the Hitlerite invaders out of Soviet Ukraine, the Red Army turned its sights on Axis-allied Romania in the spring of 1944. Powerful mechanized armies were met by German and Romanian forces along carefully-prepared defensive lines, which initially held off the attacks. But by late summer the Red Army had broken through, and Romania left the Axis to join the Allies in the liberation of Eastern Europe.&#10;&#10;Broken Axis is a complete boxed game in the Panzer Grenadier series based on these battles. You do not need any other game to play any of its 50 scenarios. Design is by Mike Perryman, creator of our Kursk: Burning Tigers game. You can play those scenarios individually, or in one of four &quot;battle games&quot; that link them together for an intense campaign experience.&#10;&#10;The Germans bring strong armored forces to the party, including Tiger and Panther tanks, Panzer IV medium tanks and the usual array of assault guns. At least that's what they have when they show up instead of leaving the fighting to the Romanians. The Romanian Army has been rebuilt from its 1941 and 1942 disasters, with German-made tanks and modern Romanian-made anti-tank guns. The Germans do provide the elite Grossdeutschland Division, and its epic stand at Tirgu Frumos is a centerpiece of the game&rsquo;s scenario set.&#10;&#10;The Red Army is powerful: the new JS-2 heavy tanks are in action, along with the first examples of the T34/85. These are the first large-scale battles fought outside the pre-war borders of the Soviet Union, and the Red Army is eager to take the fight to the Romanian &ldquo;mush eaters.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;The game includes four semi-rigid mapboards, with art by Guy Riessen. The maps are fully compatible with all others in the Panzer Grenadier series (and those from Panzer Grenadier (Modern) and Infantry Attacks, too). Plus 517 playing pieces: silky-smooth and die-cut piece, a joy just to hold in your hands. And 50 scenarios with four battle games.&#10;&#10;",

On your first turn in a round, you roll all fifteen dice &mdash; seven crew dice (brown), three passenger dice (white), and five bad guy dice (black) &mdash; then place them in the appropriate places on your display. Crew members and passengers all have unique abilities, some of which involve the option of rerolling dice.&#10;&#10;After any rerolls, you reveal your mission for the round. If you have dice on your board that match the numbers given at the top of the mission, then you're unaffected by the bold line &mdash; Bushwhacked, Gorram, etc. &mdash; immediately underneath. Otherwise, you might be forced to end your go after the current turn, forced to take an additional turn, or affected in some other way. After revealing and resolving the mission, the bad guys strike:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Each Badger die holds one supply die.&#10;    Each Saffron die moves a crew/passenger die of your choice to the cargo hold.&#10;    If Niska dice are present, KO a crew/passenger die of your choice.&#10;&#10;&#10;After this, you then use any remaining crew and passenger dice to defeat the bad guys, which generally require one point of damage to defeat. Remove them all, and you score 1 VP for each type of bad guy defeated, with half-points for each supply delivered; fail to remove them, and you score no points for the defeated bad guys. If you clear the turn, you can opt to take another turn &mdash; rolling all the bad guy dice and all non-KOed crew and passenger dice &mdash; or end your turn. If you opt to continue, but then fail to defeat the bad guys, you lose all the VP that you earned previously on that turn.&#10;&#10;After three rounds, whoever has the most VPs wins.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Super Turbo bitCrawl FX: Alpha Xtreme is a co-op game designed for 1-8 players in which our heroes venture through a dungeon in search of treasure, adventure and eventually the BOSS FIGHT!!&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, players are given a choice of eight classes within the standard four fantasy archetypes: Mage, Priest, Rogue, and Warrior. Each class has a specific number of starting dice for basic attack and agility rolls and class specific skill that is unique for each of the eight classes. After players have chosen their class they are tasked with selecting the skills that their character will possess for the duration of the game. There are eight double-sided ability inserts available to each archetype allowing for a total of 24 unique versions of each of the available eight classes. Players then select their portrait and sprite representation for this game.&#10;&#10;Once players have selected their class, abilities, and portrait, the players select the boss they will face at the end of the game. There are two bosses in the base game, along with eight abilities for the bosses to possess. This allows for a total of 48 unique bosses that the players can encounter at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Once set-up has completed, our heroes embark on their adventure through the dungeon. &#10;  &#10;A turn is divided into two phases. The first phase is the exploration phase during this phase each hero has 3 exploration actions that they can take. These include things such as moving into a new tile,  scrounging rooms for treasure, equipping items and resting to name a few. After each hero has taken their three exploration actions it is now time for the encounter phase. Random targeting determines where the encounter(s) will be taking place, the hero(es) that have been assigned an encounter will roll the encounter die to determine what they will have to contend with, be it monsters, events or nothing at all. During the encounter phase each hero is allowed one action and the encounter phase does not end until all monsters have been defeated. After the monsters have been dealt with the heroes gain experience and divvy up the treasure.  The &quot;Player One&quot; marker is moved all heroes move their special ability dice closer to the ready and the new player one starts the turn with their three exploration actions.&#10;&#10;The dungeon and all things in it, including the boss, are designed to scale based on the number of heroes playing and the highest level hero in the dungeon. As heroes level up they gain additional attack or agility dice and their special abilities require less of a cool down between uses.&#10;&#10;The base game includes 26 hex tiles, which the heroes reveal as they explore the dungeon. The boss fight is triggered by the random pull of one of these tiles that is labeled &quot;BOSS FIGHT!!!&quot; when this tile is entered all heroes teleport to the tile to do battle with the boss. STbCFX:AX is a co-op game at its core but does allow for a competitive element tied to the value of the treasure that the heroes collect while exploring the dungeon.&#10;&#10;",

        "name": "Waterloo 1815: Fallen Eagles",
        "description": "(in English, from the designer:)&#10;&#10;Waterloo 1815, Fallen eagles is a regiment/battalion level game of the famous battle.&#10;&#10;The game includes 400 counters (French, Anglo-allied and Prussian order of battle for June 18th 1815), a 108 x 75 cm map (200 meters per hexagon; 42.5 x 29.5 inches, in 2 parts), various play aids, a rule book and a playbook. It is a one hour of real time per turn game that can be completed in 5 to 10 hours of play. Beside the full battle game, several scenarios are available (Hougoumont, D'Erlon attack, Plancenoit). In addition, what if options will allow players to simulate alternate history variations to the battle.&#10;&#10;Fallen Eagles provides a detailed view of the battle but in a playable way. The focus is on morale, attrition and commitment of formation (division &amp; corps) at the right time, rather than tactical chrome. The detailed order of battle and the scale of the game allow players to really see the action and the game system provides a quick but realistic resolution.&#10;&#10;A new system has been created and combat result tables have been tested against actual historical results of this battle. This system is a mix of well-known concepts and new features to maximize playability and realism of outcomes.&#10;&#10;Formation are given simple orders than limit their ability to freely react to any sudden change of priority. Orders take some time a while before being changed. Units are classically rated for size, quality and movement. Formations activate one after the other at player's choice but have to follow the order they received at the beginning of the turn or even before. Game features offensive fire, defensive fire, opportunity fire, charge and counter charge, retreat before combat and melee. A lot of classical &quot;prohibitions&quot; are transformed into options: for example, cavalry can move from ZOC to ZOC but risk counter charges or more opportunity fire. A ZOC of a strong unit is therefore not the same as the ZOC of a weaker one.&#10;&#10;The game turn has a random ending procedure and players are never sure to have time to move all their formation reflecting the command control issues of any battle. Also, the fatigue and friction factors are built in a potentially shorter turn length in the latter stages of the battle. Focus on morale and attrition is a testimony of a battle which was a test of will of two densely packed armies fighting head to head. Players will have to choose which unit will &quot;lead&quot; the attack and take the first fire. Failing a key morale test can make the difference between a stalled attack or a promising breakthrough.&#10;&#10;Game variations will include, for example, the Prussian arrival sooner or later than history, or a better weather the day before allowing for an earlier start of the french attack.&#10;&#10;Victory is determined with &quot;sudden death&quot; objectives given to both sides in order to simulate historical constraints but also by control of key objectives and losses at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;According to Wellington, Waterloo was a &quot;near run thing&quot;. Will the thin red line hold against the French furia again?&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;================================================================&#10;&#10;(traduction fran&ccedil;aise du texte anglais:)&#10;&#10;Waterloo 1815, la chute des Aigles est un jeu de niveau r&eacute;giment / bataillon de la c&eacute;l&egrave;bre bataille.&#10;&#10;Le jeu comprend un peu plus de 400 pions (ordre de bataille fran&ccedil;ais, anglo-alli&eacute; et prussien du 18 Juin 1815), une carte 108 par 75 cm (200 m&egrave;tres par hexagone), diverses aides de jeu, un livret de r&egrave;gle et un livret de jeu. L'&eacute;chelle est d'une heure par tour et le jeu peut &ecirc;tre termin&eacute; en 5 &agrave; 10 heures. En plus de la bataille compl&egrave;te, plusieurs sc&eacute;narios sont disponibles (Hougoumont, d'Erlon attaque, Plancenoit). Des options permettront aux joueurs d'explorer des alternatives.&#10;&#10;La chute des Aigles propose une vue d&eacute;taill&eacute;e mais jouable de la bataille. L'accent est mis sur le moral, l'attrition et l'engagement des formations (division et corps) au moment opportun, plut&ocirc;t que sur le chrome tactique. L'ordre de bataille d&eacute;taill&eacute; et l'&eacute;chelle du jeu permettent aux joueurs d'entrer dans l'action. Le syst&egrave;me offre une r&eacute;solution rapide mais r&eacute;aliste des combats.&#10;&#10;Un nouveau syst&egrave;me a &eacute;t&eacute; cr&eacute;&eacute; et les tables de combat ont &eacute;t&eacute; test&eacute;s par rapport aux r&eacute;sultats historiques. Ce syst&egrave;me est un m&eacute;lange de concepts bien connus et de nouvelles fonctionnalit&eacute;s pour optimiser jouabilit&eacute; et r&eacute;alisme.&#10;&#10;Des ordres simples sont donn&eacute;s aux formations, limitant leur capacit&eacute; &agrave; r&eacute;agir &agrave; un changement soudain de priorit&eacute;. Les ordres peuvent se poursuivent avant d'&ecirc;tre chang&eacute;s. Les unit&eacute;s sont &eacute;valu&eacute;es de fa&ccedil;on habituelle par la taille, la qualit&eacute; et le mouvement. Les formations sont activ&eacute;es les unes apr&egrave;s les autres, au choix du joueur, mais doivent suivre l'ordre qu'elles ont re&ccedil;u au d&eacute;but du tour, voire avant. Le jeu inclut le feu offensif et d&eacute;fensif, les tirs d'opportunit&eacute;, la charge et la contre-charge, la retraite avant combat et la m&ecirc;l&eacute;e. Un grand nombre d'&quot;interdictions&quot; classiques sont transform&eacute;es en options : par exemple, la cavalerie peut se d&eacute;placer de ZDC (zone de contr&ocirc;le) &agrave; ZDC, mais est menac&eacute;e par la contre-charge ou le feu d'opportunit&eacute;. Une ZDC d'une unit&eacute; puissante n'est donc pas la m&ecirc;me que la ZDC d'une unit&eacute; plus faible.&#10;&#10;Le tour de jeu comprend une fin de tour al&eacute;atoire. Les joueurs ne sont jamais certains de disposer de toutes leurs formations, refl&eacute;tant les probl&egrave;mes de commandement durant toute bataille. En outre, la fatigue et la &quot;friction&quot; se traduisent dans des tours de jeu potentiellement plus courts &agrave; la fin. L'accent mis sur &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;le moral et l'usure, est un reflet de cette bataille qui fut une &eacute;preuve de d&eacute;termination pour ces deux arm&eacute;es, denses et combattant pied &agrave; pied. Les joueurs devront choisir l'unit&eacute; en t&ecirc;te qui conduira l'attaque et subira le premier feu. L'&eacute;chec d'un test de moral peut faire la diff&eacute;rence entre une attaque avort&eacute;e ou une perc&eacute;e prometteuse.&#10;&#10;Les variantes pr&eacute;voient, par exemple, l'arriv&eacute;e pr&eacute;coce ou tardive des Prussiens, ou une meilleure m&eacute;t&eacute;o la veille, permettant une attaque fran&ccedil;aise plus t&ocirc;t.&#10;&#10;La victoire est d&eacute;termin&eacute;e &agrave; la fois par des objectifs de &quot;mort subite&quot; donn&eacute;s aux deux camps afin de simuler les contraintes historiques pendant l'action, mais aussi par le contr&ocirc;le d'objectifs et les pertes inflig&eacute;es en fin de partie.&#10;&#10;Selon Wellington, Waterloo fut une &laquo;affaire tr&eacute;s serr&eacute;e&raquo;. La mince ligne rouge tiendra t-elle &agrave; nouveau contre la &laquo;furia fran&ccedil;aise&raquo; ?&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Driven back into the Pusan Perimeter, American and South Korean forces &ndash; soon joined by British, Turkish and other United Nations contingents &ndash; held the line and in the fall of 1950, launched a powerful offensive against the North Koreans. With strong tank-led forces surging northward and other units landing by sea at Inchon, the United Nations rapidly turned their victory into a North Korean rout.&#10;&#10;Korean War - Counter Attack is a complete boxed game in the Panzer Grenadier series based on these fearsome battles. You do not need any other game to play all of its 65 scenarios. Design is by Jay Townsend, creator of our Saipan game.&#10;&#10;The North Koreans have a wide array of Soviet-made weapons, spearheading their attack with T-34/85 tanks. The South Koreans are fairly lightly equipped, while their American allies bring the tanks and guns that won the Second World War: M26 Pershings, M24 Chaffees and a blistering helping of air power.&#10;&#10;New forces arrive to help out: the U.S. Marine Corps deploys some real armor this time: the the castoffs of the Pacific War, but M26 Pershings of their own. There's also a helicopter (games with helicopters are always better) and the British are here. too.&#10;&#10;The game includes four semi-rigid mapboards, with art by Guy Riessen. The maps are fully compatible with all others in the Panzer Grenadier series, and those from Panzer Grenadier (Modern) and Infantry Attacks, too. Plus 517 playing pieces: smooth, scorchless, sootless laser-cut piece, a joy just to hold in your hands. And 62 (sixty-two!) scenarios.&#10;&#10;",

The charts on the back include altitude, velocity, and fuel expenditure.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player a)burns fuel, b) calculates velocity, and c) calculate altitude.  When the velocity and altitude are both zero, the astronaut landed.  If velocity takes the craft to an altitude less than zero, the player crashes.&#10;&#10;A solo player determines success by comparing fuel expenditure value to three category ranges:  good, fair, or rotten. In multi-player, use the least amount of fuel to land without crashing.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "ENG&#10;&#10;From one of the most hidden laboratories in the Atomic Biochemistry Brave Academy (ABBA), a shout rises to the skies: &ldquo;&iexcl;Eureka!&rdquo;.  After years of research, Professor R&ouml;ntgen has invented a new thingamajig that apparently is capable of modifying the atomic composition of objects, to the point it can make them shrink and grow at will.  But the underworld of science is horrifying and his &ldquo;colleague&rdquo;, archrival and former student, Professor Stern, wants to steal his idea.  In the next few days, the Academy is going to decide which department will get funds to continue their research, so lab safety has become a secondary concern.  Both professors must use their scientists and students wisely, to get the most astonishing test results, while discretely trying to sabotage your rival.&#10;&#10;To get the best experimental samples, you must use the ray to manipulate the value and size of your dice, while you sabotage your opponent, by modifying his.  The higher the visible value on the die, and the smaller the die is, the more points you will get.   To win the game (and get the funds!), you will have to get the most points with this method.&#10;&#10;During your turn, you can perform one or more actions (without repeating any).  The available actions are represented on the control panel board, and you will use scientists and students to trigger them.  Each turn is played in three consecutive steps.  Once you're finished, it&rsquo;s your opponent's turn, and so on until the end of the game.  These are the three steps:&#10;&#10;Action Selection: Choose the actions you want to perform this turn.  First, pick a student from your hand and place in in the control panel, covering the action it&rsquo;s going to perform. Then, use your available scientists to select one or more actions, as explained below.  Note:  you can&rsquo;t repeat the action on a student card.&#10;Action resolution: In whatever order you choose, perform your selected actions, taking back the corresponding scientists and students as you do. Student cards go straight to the discard pile, but you get your scientist team back for next turn.  If you haven&rsquo;t shot the ray this turn, take the extra scientist, aside from your two regular ones.  This additional scientist will help you during your next turn.  If it is already in your possession, and you have shot the ray this turn, put it back, next to the testing room board.&#10;Hiring a new student: Once you have solved all the actions, draw a new student card from the deck.  You will continue drawing cards every turn until the deck is over.  Once the deck is depleted, keep playing your cards from your hand normally.  Once all students have been used (players don&rsquo;t have available student cards in their hands), shuffle the student cards deck to form a new face down pile on the table.  Both players draw two new student cards and continue playing normally.&#10;&#10;SPA&#10;&#10;De uno de los laboratorios m&aacute;s perdidos de la Atomic Biochemistry Brave Academy (ABBA), surge un grito que clama al cielo: &ldquo;&iexcl;Eureka!&rdquo;.  Tras a&ntilde;os de investigaci&oacute;n, el profesor R&ouml;ntgen ha inventado un nuevo cachivache que parece ser capaz de modificar la composici&oacute;n at&oacute;mica de los objetos, hasta el punto de poder reducirlos y aumentarlos a su antojo.  Pero los bajos fondos del mundo cient&iacute;fico son repugnantes y su &quot;colega&quot;, archienemigo y antiguo alumno suyo, el profesor Stern, est&aacute; decidido a robarle la idea. Y es que en los pr&oacute;ximos d&iacute;as se determina qu&eacute; departamento obtiene la subvenci&oacute;n de la academia para continuar con su trabajo, as&iacute; que la seguridad de los experimentos se ha convertido en algo secundario.  Ambos profesores deben emplear a sus estudiantes eficientemente para tratar de obtener los resultados m&aacute;s espectaculares posibles, mientras tratan de sabotear discretamente a su rival.&#10;&#10;Para conseguir las mejores muestras experimentales, debes utilizar el rayo para manipular el valor y el tama&ntilde;o de los dados de tu color, a la vez que saboteas a tu oponente modificando los suyos.  Contra mayor sea el valor de un dado y menor sea su tama&ntilde;o, m&aacute;s puntos otorga al jugador de ese color. Para ganar la partida (&iexcl;y hacerte con la subvenci&oacute;n!), tendr&aacute;s que ser t&uacute; el que consiga m&aacute;s puntos de este modo.&#10;&#10;Durante tu turno puedes realizar una o m&aacute;s acciones (sin repetir ninguna). Las acciones disponibles est&aacute;n representadas en el tablero a modo de cuadro de mandos, y para realizarlas necesitas emplear cient&iacute;ficos y estudiantes.  Los turnos se juegan en tres pasos consecutivos. Cuando los termines, le toca jugar a tu oponente y os ir&eacute;is turnando as&iacute; hasta que acabe la partida. Los pasos son los siguientes:&#10;&#10;1.       Selecci&oacute;n de acciones: Selecciona las acciones a realizar. Elige un estudiante de tu mano y ponlo en el cuadro de mandos, de forma que tape la acci&oacute;n correspondiente. A continuaci&oacute;n, emplea a tus cient&iacute;ficos para seleccionar una o m&aacute;s acciones, seg&uacute;n el caso, como se explica m&aacute;s abajo. Nota:  no puedes repetir la acci&oacute;n de la carta de estudiante.&#10;2.       Resoluci&oacute;n de acciones: En el orden que desees, resuelve cada una de las acciones seleccionadas, retirando al hacerlo al estudiante o cient&iacute;ficos correspondientes. Las cartas de estudiante retiradas van a al mazo de descarte, pero los cient&iacute;ficos los recuperas para tu siguiente turno. Si no has disparado en este turno, adem&aacute;s de tus 2 cient&iacute;ficos, coge tambi&eacute;n al cient&iacute;fico extra, que te ayudar&aacute; durante el turno siguiente. Si ya lo ten&iacute;as y en este turno has disparado, devu&eacute;lvelo.&#10;3.       Reclutar un nuevo estudiante: Una vez resueltas las acciones, roba una nueva carta. Deber&aacute;s seguir robando al final de cada turno hasta que se acabe el mazo de robo.  Una vez se acabe el mazo de robo, seguir&aacute;s jugando con las cartas que te queden en la mano. Cuando se haya empleado a todos los estudiantes (no tengas cartas en la mano), vuelve a barajar los estudiantes para formar un nuevo mazo de robo y robad dos cartas cada uno, para continuar normalmente.&#10;&#10;",

The rivalry is fierce, and you must manage your crew, defend against verbal and physical attacks, or sabotage your opponent&rsquo;s research in order to discover new species of dinosaurs, or important scientific discoveries.  Your goal is to have more victory points (academic notoriety) than your opponent when the draw deck runs out.&#10;&#10;Dinos, Dice and Dynamite is a solitaire game designed for the 2014 Solitaire PnP contest. Each round, the player must supply and then decide which activities they and their crew (dice) will do, from finding new sites to dig, to studying fossils, to sabotaging your opponent's discoveries.&#10;&#10;The player places generic cubes and six sided dice to mark these choices. The dice may give a bonus to some activities, but they might also prompt a reaction from the AI controlled opponent. The player may nearly uncover a new dinosaur, only to have their work destroyed by a jealous opponent. A combination of careful planning, and riskier sabotage is needed to earn more victory points than your opponent.&#10;&#10;",

They may also use Prophet and Skeptic cards to look at the false gods, deducing the identity of the One True God by process of elimination.&#10;&#10;Eventually someone will call for Judgment Day, when the One True God is revealed and players receive positive or negative points depending on which virtues that god liked or did not like.&#10;&#10;",

Well-deserved leave - Furlough - during which it was possible to visit home or a fianc&eacute;e. Easy to say, hard to accomplish. The war continues, and there are disuptions everywhere and overcrowded trains. Cossacks are prowling along the roads and suspicious Austrian military policemen are looking on marching from the front soldiers. Our Furlough is in force only for the week - 7 short days and nights. The soldiers must act quickly and count on a bit of luck.&#10;&#10;Przepustka (A Furlough) is a game intended for 2, 3, 4 or 5 players. Each of players controls two soldiers - using movement cards they help them reach family and friends safely and don't get into trouble. Victory points are awarded for visited destinations. It is also possible to gain these points thanks to cards or by visiting storage locations. The winner is the player whose soldiers manage to gather most victory points.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Walec Parowy 1914 (Steam Roller 1914) is a war board game, which was released in May 2014 by the Forum of Polish Malopolska Branch Historical Society project The Great War in Malopolska - memory and identity.&#10;&#10;The game provides two modes - for two or four players. In both cases, each player takes command of two armies or associations operating. It receives the relevant boards of the army and pools chips and card deck of cards generals of staff. For the game on the board influenced these cards staff, especially the generals who lead our armies into battle. At the beginning of the game we have such a scenario which determines - that is suitable for autumn 1914, during the game we can not change them. Generals have characteristics that affect the gameplay. The most important is an initiative of deciding on the order of execution of commands the army and orders, informing us how many orders we can spread the chips on the board. Cards and indicate how many cards of Staff tighten at the beginning of each turn. These factors can be modified by other cards of Staff, which assign the army (up to 3 cards), putting them on these boards army generals next card. In addition, staff can use the card in a different way - by playing them as an action during your turn or turn another player. The applied procedure allows us to influence the strength and mobility of the army, and thus develop their own, each time another strategy. Cards staff played as stocks allow us to accelerate the arrival of reinforcements such as on the board, or on the contrary force the opponent deploy the neighboring front of any of several units.&#10;&#10;The game consists of six or eight turns, and each of the four phases. The first three are played simultaneously by all players. In the preparation phase we select the appropriate number of cards, we draw card of weather, check supplies, we join the army staff card or change the generals at their stations. In the phase of aviation spread the chips on the board planes that make us the third phase. This is the instruction phase, in which we place our units orders - march, spread, defend, retreat, reorganization, support, or crossing. If the field with our units appeared aircraft orders, we must spread face up - in a transparent manner. It was not until the fourth and final phase of motion play as an initiative of the cards generals - from highest to lowest. We then move orders or spread. If you meet the armies opposing players battle occurs. This is to be decided on the basis of the points of strength and modifiers. The final outcome of the battle can affect tightens card battle. Emotions provide the card with the arrow symbol - they require tightening next card, the count of all modifiers. Thanks to the great happiness we can overcome the enemy an advantage of more mesh than allowed by the cube d6. After all, is not familiar with such episodes of military history. In contrast to the loss of power affects individuals involved in the battle - of course, bears attacking them proportionally more. All the time, we can also use the cards of Staff.&#10;&#10;The game is won by the player (or the site in the case of 4-seater variant), which scores more points wins. Most gain for controlling individual identified in the scenario, cities. The Russian side can further plunder the fields of the German Empire and the Kingdom of Hungary - action is causing the loss of points by Austria. Extra points goes to sometimes get as a result of the great victories or destruction of the enemy army staff.&#10;&#10;",

K&#197;&#130;amcianka is a card game that simulates the start of these powerful beings in the struggle for considerable rate - angel feathers.&#10;&#10;The form of the universe created by James &#196;&#134;wiek, dozens of unique skills, special cards which place the game on its head and lots of laughter! Make truces, and then it quickly column -  in the Liar universe there is nothing permanent.&#10;&#10;What is the game? In short, the idea is to collect the largest possible amount of feathers (which icons are shown on almost every card) and most annoy other players would not have a chance with us when it comes to counting points. At the beginning of each game, each participant draws fun for yourself one of the characters and places it face &quot;Inactive&quot; to the top. Then all derive 7 cards on hand and starts playing&#10;&#10;A player in his turn, he may do one of the following: attack someone, play the effect described on the card, replace one card to another (in the dark), or select the card to be in the hands of their 7 (if our budget was depleted during the game) . Each card beyond the value of the feathers (which is taken into account only at the end of the game) has a specific strength. The majority also has its effect, which we can use for example during the fight, whether or separately - consuming it his turn.&#10;You have to combine so as to eventually collect as many feathers. For this purpose, it is certainly useful Liars title card, but it also has a hitch - yes, gives the largest amount of feathers (3), however, the player who will be at the end of most &quot;Liars&quot; automatically loses. Remedy this, we can only exchanging with others (hopefully take us to the card), or finding a card Liar, which cancels the harmful effects of one of the Liar&#10;&#10;important:&#10;the game can be purchased only in the set of the latest book &#196;&#134;wiek - &quot;Liar 2.5&quot;&#10;rules have been on the last few pages of &quot;Liar 2.5&#10;&#10;",

Tithe is a fun card game in which four different kings struggle to raise more gold and to take power in the kingdom.&#10;&#10;Tithe is a quick and easy game designed by Pablo Bella, for 2-4 players ages 8, lasting about 30 minutes.&#10;&#10;In the game, players have hidden identities, and try to gain the power of the crown for their families. There are four kings in the game that make a deck of kings, and determine the predominant color in the course of the game.&#10;&#10;In addition to the kings deck, there is a character deck. Players draw cards from this deck, and each round players will play character card to try to win the trick. Each character has a color (of the family), a strength value to measure victories in trick that are played and a value in gold (victory points).&#10;&#10;When everybody plays one card strength and families are compared to determine which player wins the trick. This continues until all character cards from the deck have been played. But beware! It is not the player who wins the most tricks that wins the game, but the player that accumulates the most gold!&#10;&#10;Tithe is a very quick and simple game, available in Spanish and English version and totally free for all Dizemo fans.&#10;&#10;",

In safe locations, encounters will tend to be friendly, or harmless, while in dangerous locations, encounters will be aggressive and will be a liability to the player. Each encounter card shows three type of behaviors, and the player applies the one, associated to the location he was met. &#10;To deal with an encounter, the player will use action points. If the player has no action points, he will suffer the consequences, which will involve, eventually, spending time, and the player only has a limited amount of time/days/turns, to catch the culprit.&#10;&#10;The player will have to go through the investigation deck, gaining clues and evidence, to frame the suspect, that will make the player understand where the criminal is hiding.&#10;It's up to the player to determine how fast or slow he should investigate, keeping track of his action points, knowing where he's investigating, and managing his time, action points and the risks.&#10;&#10;Once the player has gained enough evidence (in the evidence phase) he will decide wether to keep investigating, to gain more evidence which will limit the number of locations the murderer will try to hide in, or start looking for the criminal, early on (but with more places to search him, into).&#10;&#10;Dystopian: the adventure deck game is the second installment in the dystopian trilogy, with Dystopian: the manhunt, and the soon to be finalized: Dystopian: raise and fall.&#10;&#10;",
