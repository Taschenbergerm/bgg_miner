        "description": "The party game Family Bingo requires dexterity, good memory, perceptiveness, and some basic knowledge. Players compete in eight different categories of activities, and the game includes 165 double-sided cards that tell players what to do.&#10;&#10;A very important component of the game are 96 colorful wooden sticks in six colors; the game also includes 96 small number tokens and 16 big tokens. At the beginning of the game, each player receives a nice covering stand and personal bingo board. Players try to score a point by completing the task on the drawn card. The first player to do so covers a field on her bingo board with the number drawn at the beginning of the round. The tasks are very different, e.g., building a construction on time or after memorizing it, answering questions, guessing what another player is trying to visualize, guessing the color or number of sticks, throwing, stacking, and many, many more. Whoever creates a bingo first wins!&#10;&#10;",

The goal is to figure out the best sequence to play your cards in order to score the most points and be declared the best festival organizer.&#10;&#10;A game can take between 6 to 16 turns depending on the number of players and points are awarded for each journey depending on the  Castle and Coast cards played. Each scoring card seeks out varying combinations of Dragons, Pandas, Tigers and Chows. In addition each player has hidden goals involving lanterns, animals and castle combinations.&#10;&#10;",

Two railroad lines, one starting in California and the other in Iowa, set out to create a seriously divided nation&rsquo;s first transcontinental railroad. In The Golden Spike, two players take on the role of a railroad magnate, building half of this famous accomplishment in transportation. It&rsquo;s a race, to be sure, and the first player to reach Promontory Summit, Utah gains prestige and bonus money. However, the winner of the game is the player who makes the most profit along the way, which requires a delicate balance of planning and cunning.&#10;&#10;Players alternately select three-card stacks from a row of them, with only one of the three cards visible. These allow the players to perform various actions, such as hiring workers and buying materials, both needed in the construction of the railroad sections they'll need to complete to get to Promontory Summit... and sometimes men and materials may be hoarded and in short supply. If an Inspector appears when turning over a face-down card, a turn ends immediately and no actions are executed. Three terrain types present a quandary for both players: faster construction or greater profits.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Airships vs Aliens is a quick strategy boardgame for two players, with one player defending the Earth with ten Steampunk Airship miniatures, while the opposing player attempts to win the invasion using ten alien ship miniatures. The game is pure strategy with no luck elements involved.&#10;&#10;Each side has 5 Gunships, 3 Warships and 2 Commandships. The first player to eliminiate both opposing Commandships wins. Each turn a player takes actions with one piece. An action is moving one square forward in the direction facing, turning the ship 90 degrees or firing the long range guns. Gunships have no long range guns, Warships have them with a range of 1 square forward and Commandship long guns can fire with a range of 2 squares forward. Gunships have up to 4 actions when moved, Warships have 3 and Commandships have 2.&#10;&#10;To deepen the strategy each side has 5 command tokens that one can be used during a turn to give a ship an extra action. Another strategy element is that when you lose Warships or Commandships you may be able to bring a destroyed ship back to board as reinforcements.&#10;&#10;",

Some cards produce resources or transform one type of resources into another and award victory points, while others let you perform actions. Carefully planning the chain of cards that you will play during the game turn is the key to success.&#10;&#10;Artificium lasts four turns. At the start of each turn, players have five cards in hand, with six cards being face-up on the table as a card market. During the turn, players first have a chance to exchange some cards from their hands with those in the market, then they play and resolve their cards step by step, performing actions, trading and gathering resources, and most importantly, refining certain resources into other resources to earn victory points. Crystals on the players' individual resource boards keep track of their resources as they are bought and sold. Crystals placed beside the board represent player's coins. The final score is determined after the fourth turn, with players selling any remaining resources to score additional victory points (one point per four coins). The player with the most victory points is considered to be the wisest medieval ruler and is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Players then start asking each other questions &mdash; &quot;Why are you dressed so strangely?&quot; or &quot;When was the last time we got a payday?&quot; or anything else you can come up with &mdash; trying to guess who among them is the spy. The spy doesn't know where he is, so he has to listen carefully. When it's his time to answer, he'd better create a good story!&#10;&#10;At any time during a round, one player may accuse another of being a spy. If all other players agree with the accusation, the round ends and the accused player has to reveal his identity. If the spy is uncovered, all other players score points.  However, the spy can himself end a round by announcing that he understands what the secret location is; if his guess is correct, only the spy scores points.&#10;&#10;After a few rounds of guessing, suspicion and bluffing, the game ends and whoever has scored the most points is victorious!&#10;&#10;",

It includes the most interesting cards and scenario variants, extensive guide for the moderator. Be prepared for the challenge; see the game the way it is meant to be played!&#10;&#10;Did we mention that Vampire Mafia inhabits a unique setting, one in which vampires are good guys who are ready to spill the blood of the vampire hunters, who are the forces of evil?

        "description": "Meazy N More! is essentially a game system, comprising 144 dice &mdash; 36 for each player, 6 each in 6 colors.  You can play with two copies of the game to allow 5&ndash;8 players.  An unusual feature of this game system is that there are core rules that all the games use.  The core rules instruct players to roll their dice, form legal combinations for the game they're playing, then put their unused dice back in their &quot;rolling bins&quot;, and pass them to the left.  Each such round of veritable drafting is called a &quot;shake&quot;.  Shakes continue until someone wins the game.&#10;&#10;Meazy N More! comes with rules for four games built upon those core rules:&#10;&#10;     In Eazy Meazy (30 minutes, ages 5+), you must build a &quot;pyramid&quot; of dice: 1&times;1 though 6&times;6; however, each &quot;level&quot; of one number must be a different color, and once a die is assigned to a level, that level's color is locked.&#10;     Not So Eazy Meazy (30 minutes, ages 5+) differs from Eazy Meazy by allowing the player to choose on the fly which number goes in each level; rearranging is completely legal.&#10;     Meazy Street (90 minutes, ages 8+) is the featured game (ages 8+). In addition to forming a pyramid, you must form a &quot;straight&quot; and a &quot;rainbow&quot;, but these things must be done in a particular sequence. Unlike the previous two games, you calculate your score for the round based on the combinations you form.&#10;     Splitting Headache (90 minutes, ages 8+) is billed as a bonus game. In this game, you try to form the four different types of &quot;splits&quot;, after which you may work to form the &quot;banana split&quot; out of the remaining dice. You calculate your score for the round based on the splits you formed by the time the round ended.&#10;&#10;&#10;Further games for the system will be released as expansion packs and/or downloads from the publisher's website.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "DESCRIPTION: Darkrock Ventures is a worker placement game about mining and exporting in a hostile outer space. Players will be controlling a mining company working in harsh conditions to acquire the most credits.&#10;&#10;GENERAL INFO: A euro game for 1-5 players that plays in about 30-45 minutes.&#10;&#10;THEME: Science Fiction. Space is a hostile environment with a known alien presence. Resources are scarce and it is commonplace for companies to mine asteroids to acquire them. It is known that aliens raid these asteroids and therefore mining companies are geared accordingly in preparation of being attacked. Lives are lost in this line of work daily, but if you run a good crew you can make it out alive and rich!&#10;&#10;HOOK: Richly thematic euro incorporating dice and dice manipulation, with worker placement, resource farming and exporting.&#10;&#10;WINNING CONDITION: Highest Credits when the end of the game is triggered. Credits are acquired primarily from exporting minerals mined from the asteroid.&#10;&#10;MECHANICS: A round begins with rolling a set of Power Dice, these are community dice that players will use in order to successfully mine the asteroid. Players then take turns placing workers throughout different space stations and on a mineral rich asteroid.&#10;&#10;After all the workers have been placed a third and more volatile Power Die is rolled. A player starts his/her turn by rolling his/her Rig Dice, these represent the a power element of his/her mining equipment that is to be paired with the community Power Dice in order to successfully mine resources from the asteroid. Then he/she resolves all his/her workers. As soon as players begin exporting minerals, hostile alien ships begin patrolling and will attack every round making it more difficult to resolve all the workers successfully.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, players will be increasing their worker count, gaining and spending credits (which are the victory points), gaining additional Rig Dice and acquiring explosive Neutronium bombs to protect them from the alien attacks.&#10;&#10;When 3 of the 6 resource nodes on the asteroid are void of minerals the end of the game is triggered. The round is finished and the player with the most credits wins the game.&#10;&#10;Darkrock Ventures will also include special 2-player game rules, as well as a Solo/Co-Operative variant.&#10;&#10;",

To obtain the bonus specified by the mission/place card as well as a reward, both missions/orders must be completed in time (by the end of the year.).&#10;&#10;Each Resource card have the &quot;cost&quot; of planting the crop in the upright corner (i.e Tomato have 2), so to plant, just place a resource card/crop on the table and discard the cards necessary from your hand. ONE token is then placed on the first blank space, in the next turn you place another token or harvest if ready (The crop is ready for harvest on the turn after the last token has been placed). The harvested crops represented by tokens are placed in their corresponding space in the barn, and the card return to your hand.&#10;&#10;Each card lists the products that can be manufactured that resource. To manufacture simply pay the cost using either resource cards, and/or resources token stored in the barn, (the cards used go to the discard pile and tokens used are back to the token pile). Then place a token on its corresponding place on the shelve. You may manufacture as many products as desired (or posible) per turn.&#10;&#10;There are 2 kinds of buildings in the game. Common buildings (Stables, Dairy, Henhouse, Sheep Yard), each player can build his own.  And uniques buildings (Train Station, General Store, Inn, and Workshop).&#10;&#10;The game ends after 12 rounds/seasons, after which the player with the highest amount of victory points wins. Victory points obtained during the game (by completing missions) are added to the points given by Resources,  products and buildings.&#10;&#10;",

At every move you must make decisions that will determine the fate of the men you command. Your troops must face bombardment from the enemy's artillery, tanks and aeroplanes. How many men will you risk on a particular course of action?&#10;&#10;A game for 2-4 players where you take a role as a British Company Commander attempting to be the first to reach the &quot;Objective Line&quot;. You start from your own trench and must advance across &quot;No Man's Land&quot; while trying to limit your casualties. It's a &quot;push your luck&quot; game where you roll dice and play cards matching the roll, after which you can decide to try to advance further, or stop and carry out card actions. Pushing too far could incur heavy losses.&#10;&#10;",

This game requires speed, a sharp eye, creativity and memory. Is so appropriate to train memory, attention and creativity capacities and also communication and social skills needed in any social context.&#10;&#10;1. Deal all the cards among the players more or less evenly. It doesn't matter if a given player receives an extra card.&#10;&#10;2. Each player will form a stack of cards in front of him/her. Cards must be placed face down so that no one can see them.&#10;&#10;3. The player with the strangest face begins, by taking a card and placing it face up in the middle of the table, within reach of all the players. Clockwise, each player will take a card and place it in the central stack. The moment two cards showing the same alien or the same letter coincide, any player can cover the central stack with his/her hand and the fastest in doing so must shout out a word beginning with the letter on the covered card.&#10;&#10;Then, he/she must take all the cards from the central stack and, mockingly, distribute them how he/she chooses among the remaining players. This player will place a new card in the central deck to continue the game. The cards that players receive are incorporated to their stack of cards at the bottom.&#10;&#10;4. The game continues in the same way: the moment two aliens or letters coincide again, any player can cover the central stack with his/her hand and, at that moment, he/she must shout out the preceding word and add a new one beginning with the letter on the card that he/she has just been covered.&#10;&#10;Progressively, a word sequence will be formed that must be memorized. If a mistake is made while shouting out the word sequence or if a word is invalid because of a spelling mistake or if he/she has covered the central deck when two cards do not match, the player receives the central stack of cards and places a new card in the central deck to continue the game. The existing word sequence is eliminated and begins to reform.&#10;&#10;5. The first player to get rid of all of his/her cards wins the game.    &#10;Variations of the game: play using not just real words but also words in other languages, invented words or sounds.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Since Pinocchio has come to the Carpenter's house, the Carpenter is no longer lonely. However, because naughty Pinocchio lies too often, he gradually fails to distinguish between true and false. Therefore, one day, the Angel told Pinocchio: &quot;If you can finish an adventure on your own without telling any lies and detect the lies of the others in the journey, you will become a 'real' boy.&quot; Can Pinocchio eventually become a real boy and live happily ever after with the Carpenter?&#10;&#10;Pinocchio: True or False is an enlightening and bonding storytelling game. A player draws a subject card, chooses one of the four subjects on the card, decides whether the story she is going to tell will be true or just a lie, then begins her story. The other players listen to the story to judge its veracity. After the story has been told, the one who grabs the Pinocchio doll first can ask the storyteller a question, which the storyteller must answer honestly &mdash; unless her story is a lie, of course, in which case she can say what she wants.&#10;&#10;Each player then secretly votes on whether or not the story was a lie. Those who guess incorrectly must take a wooden nose block and make Pinocchio's nose grow by stacking their block onto his ever-lengthening nose. When a player places the nose block, the tree rings on the block must be fully covered and not visible. If any blocks fall, whoever caused this gets an &quot;Angel Token&quot;. When a player gets his third angel token, the game ends after this round, and the player with the fewest angel tokens win.&#10;&#10;In order to make gameplay more challenging, if half or more players guess correctly as to whether the story is or isn't true, the storyteller must also add a block to the nose. Therefore, the storyteller should do her best to make the story confusing.&#10;&#10;",

The poor old chef can't undo the spells because his vision is blurred, so the kitchen elves need to use magic potions to re-dye the bleached ingredients and try to protect them from the gluttonous magic garbage bin and further attacks from naughty students.&#10;&#10;In Magi Kitchen, five wooden ingredients are placed in the middle of the table and the eighty cards are dealt out evenly among the players; cards show either a bleached food item (that is, a white carrot, white cucumber, etc.), a dye, a garbage can, or a student.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player turns over the top card from her draw pile and places it in a personal magic pile. If both a bleached ingredient and the matching colored potion are visible on players' magic piles, then players race to grab the proper wooden ingredient; whoever does so claims the magic piles showing these items and places them under her draw pile. If a rainbow magic potion is revealed, then it matches all bleached ingredients showing on magic piles and players can grab any of them. If a magic hungry garbage can is revealed, players instead race to cover a magic pile that shows a bleached ingredient, thereby protecting it from making its way to the trash; as a reward the player places the magic pile under her draw pile. Finally, if a naughty student card is revealed, everyone must race to perform the magic gesture shown on the card; whoever is the last to do so must maintain this gesture until the next student card is drawn.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one or two players have run out of cards in their draw piles, and whoever has the most cards wins. Magi Kitchen includes advanced rules in which the active player, before revealing her card, decides whether to play on her own magic pile or that of her left- or right-hand neighbor.&#10;&#10;",

Players play different kinds of profession cards that can either produce income or force other players to take their cards back into their hands. In each turn, players choose a playing mode that determines how many cards they draw and how many action points they get. Action points are used to play cards, either profession cards, action cards (which activate the profession cards), or special skill cards. The different races can also use their special abilities to tip the balance in their favor.&#10;&#10;Depending on the strategy a player chooses for a given turn, she gains a certain number of cards and action points. Action points are needed to play cards, either to let different profession enter the playing field, activate those already in the field, or use other abilities. Activated cards can earn money or attack other players.&#10;&#10;A player wins the game immediately by meeting one of the following victory conditions:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Owning at least 45 Dollars.&#10;    Owning at least three full sets of professions and having at least 15 Dollars.&#10;    Owning units from all seven different professions and having at least 15 Dollars.&#10;    Being the last player left in the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The Alley Cat strives to catch those annoying mice. They sneak into the cube to eat garbage. And the dog just wants to be left alone resting, but of course can bite, so watch out. Everyone must hurry to reach his goal before the pipes are opened and water wipes out the street.&#10;&#10;During the game each side in alternating turns, moves one of his pieces (the cat or a mouse) and also the dog. The aim of the mice is to make the most of his pieces jump into the garbage can. But the cat will try to thwart this, because his goal is to devour most mice, and avoid being eaten by the dog. Both sides push the garbage can as one more piece to take advantage or thwart your opponent. Furthermore, both sides control the slow movements of the dog. This movement acts as a timer that, at mid-game, causes the disappearance of the mice that have not been put into play and the arrival of reinforcements and, on reaching the 31st turn, triggers the end game.&#10;&#10;Spanish description:&#10;&#10;El gato callejero se afana en atrapar a los molestos ratones. Ellos se cuelan en el cubo de la basura para comer. Y el perro s&oacute;lo quiere que lo dejen descansar, pero por supuesto puede morder, as&iacute; que ten cuidado. Todo el mundo debe darse prisa para lograr su objetivo antes de que se abran las ca&ntilde;er&iacute;as y el agua acabe barriendo la calle.&#10;&#10;Durante el juego cada bando en turnos alternos, mueve una de sus piezas (el gato o uno de los ratones) y adem&aacute;s al perro. El objetivo de los ratones es lograr que la mayor&iacute;a de sus piezas salten al interior del cubo de basura. Pero el gato tratar&aacute; de frustrar esto,  porque su meta es devorar a la mayor&iacute;a de ratones, evitando ser comido por el perro. Ambos bandos empujan el cubo como una pieza m&aacute;s para favorecerse o perjudicar a su rival. Adem&aacute;s ambos manipulan los lentos movimientos del perro. Este movimiento se comporta como un temporizador que, a mitad de la partida, provoca la desaparici&oacute;n de los ratones que no se han puesto en juego y la llegada de nuevos refuerzos y que, al alcanzarse el turno 31, desencadena el final del juego.&#10;&#10;",

This represents your Senator entering the Senate chambers.

If conspiring, the most recently played senator is removed from the game.

The units start off rested (face down &amp; hidden from your opponents) and stacked into armies of three units (small, medium, &amp; large). They can be revealed to activate abilities, surprise with counter effects, and to gain additional movement points via force marching. Each round consists of players taking turns commanding their units and armies with a limited number of command tokens. At the end of the round all units that have not been commanded are flipped face down and are considered rested again. Play continues until one player captures a majority of an opponent&rsquo;s units or captures their king.&#10;&#10;",

After the army had been by-passed in the attack of Berlin starting April 15, it became encircled and contained by Russian forces who would deal with it later. However, the Russian units containing it were minimal and found themselves in a precarious situation between the German 9th and 12th Armies. In the Halbe region, west of Berlin. The Americans were west of the 12th Army at the Elbe River and instructed not to advance further. The German forces of the 9th Army were threadbare, yet, determined to move west towards the Americans for better POW treatment. Hitler had ordered 12th Army (also threadbare) to attack east towards 9th Army. That order was ignored. Thus, the last remaining strength of the 9th Army, some 50,000 men and AFV&rsquo;s struck west for 12th Army positions. In between, were Russian rearguard units, each with unclear orders as to how to handle this situation in this backwater of the Berlin area. Only 20,000 succeeded.&#10;&#10;",

At one point, in early October, it actually seemed possible to reach Moscow before the winter because there was little to halt them. That chance was wasted and the weather turned against Hitler&rsquo;s forces. By the time this game takes place, both sides were like mighty but weakened warriors. The German strengths on average had been reduced by 50%- a division was now only a regiment in strength. Panzer divisions were lucky to have 50 operational tanks. The Russians were no better off, they simply had more weak units to toss in the way, Weather made the fighting bitter and the Germans did not have winter clothing. Fuel and ammo Corps&rsquo; depots frequently had only enough for one division on a limited basis, not 3-4 divisions, which was the norm.&#10;&#10;",

It was here that the White Army made its attempt to breakthrough to Lenin's Moscow. To be sure, when the Whites seized the city from the weak 13th Army using aircraft and tanks, Lenin and Tolstoy were in panic mode. So much so, they began massive defensive work programs building barriers on Moscow approaches. The White Army seemed unstoppable with its elite, well trained and armed Volunteer Army. All resources were diverted and sent to the Orel area. First, the Reds had to halt the advance and then counterattack, otherwise, Moscow could be reached. The main forces of the Red Fourteenth and Thirteenth armies continued their retreat toward the north and northwest under attacks from the White forces. Kornilov&rsquo;s division defeated the right-flank units of the Thirteenth Army and captured Orel on October 13. The retreat of the Red 7th and 9th Rifle divisions exposed the flanks of the main attack force, and its communications with the Thirteenth Army were disrupted. From the 13th to 19th, The Whites held the city but their flanks were being broken. The Reds took it on the 20th.&#10;&#10;",

Each turn, players receive three cards &mdash; two face-up and one face-down &mdash; then they pass one card to their left-hand player until someone calls &quot;Brunch&quot;. If you want to continue passing, you have to draw an aqua card (which usually grants penalties in the scoring phase). When all of the aqua cards are gone or everyone has agreed to &quot;brunch&quot;, players start the scoring phase. Everyone then plays one of their score (food) cards; whoever played the strongest combination chooses one of the just played score (food) cards, then the next player chooses, etc. After six rounds, the game ends.&#10;&#10;",

With the shadows to thank, the Borgia family is at the peak of their power. In a week the Cardinals will gather for the Conclave. With your reputation you could never win the seat, but you may be able to control who does!&#10;&#10;HOOK: It's like Coup meets Liar's Dice! A quick and glorious game of lies and deceit! Richly thematic and completely immersive.&#10;&#10;WINNING CONDITION: Having secretly controlled the Cardinal who has the most influence at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;MECHANICS: Players are randomly given an identity at the beginning of the game. It is imperative that they keep their identity secret from the other players. These identities represent the Cardinal who they want to gain the most influence.&#10;&#10;6 cards representing Cardinals, are randomly placed in an ascending ladder-like line up. A Cardinals position on this ladder determines how much, if any, influence they will gain at the end of the turn.&#10;&#10;Using dice and bluffing in a similar fashion to Liar's Dice, players will be able to manipulate a Cardinal's position on the ladder; or manipulate how much influence they have; or even accuse another player of the Cardinal they are controlling.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, if another player has accurately paired you with a Rumor Card, one that matches your secret identity, you lose; regardless of how much influence you may have acquired for your Cardinal.&#10;&#10;",

Nonetheless, the Town Center is prosperous, and the managers of the weird CliniC have been duly incarcerated for years by this point. Now it is time to reach a new step: Building a new map transit.&#10;&#10;In Tramways, you take the role of one of the managers of the local CliniC who were fired last month when it was discovered that you had acquired wealth on the backs of patients and their poor health. You are now at the head of a team of engineers, ready to build the best and most effective network possible for Small City. Your aim is to find the best places between buildings and citizens so that they can use your networks (and not those of your opponents, who are always ready to buy the most interesting development areas). Be assured that a happy citizen who is able to move where and when he wants will thank the best transport companies. There is nothing that satisfies a chief manager more than seeing citizens happy...&#10;&#10;The game is divided into six rounds, each of which is divided into two halves:&#10;&#10;&#10;     During the first half of a round, players compete to acquire the best development cards to create their most efficient deck. An original auction phase also determines turn order &mdash; and being the first player increases your stress level.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     During the second half, they play a train game, using their deck to try to build a great network between the different buildings of Small City. They try to move passengers without stressing them during the transit, in the end obtaining happiness points, which is the aim of the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;The more that players use the symbols on their cards, the more actions they can do, but they also increase their stress level at the same time, which leads to negative victory points...&#10;&#10;",

If you're playing with two two-player teams, each team gets four balls. If you're only playing with two players, each player gets eight balls. Flip over one of the pattern cards to see which pattern you need to create. The green cards are easier than the blue cards. Then, you can either take turns bouncing your balls into the grid or bounce the balls all at once. If your balls create the pattern first, you win that card.

Make your choices wisely so you can become the #1 network.&#10;&#10;Prime Time is played over six rounds, divided into two seasons of three rounds each. During each round, players will bid for and take their actions - buy shows, hire and fire talent, or play golf, among other things.&#10;&#10;Each round follows 4 phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Development phase &ndash; Players take 3 actions each. &#10;    Broadcasting phase &ndash; Players set up their TV schedule and try to attract demographics. &#10;    Award show phase (only in rounds 3 and 6) &ndash; Players score points based on their performance.&#10;    Income phase &ndash; Get paid, clear the board and set up for the new round.&#10;&#10;&#10;At the end of the 6th round, each player counts their remaining cash and gains 1 VP for each full $3.&#10;The player with the most VP wins the game!&#10;&#10;",

The players who controls the ball plays offensive cards which, combined with a die roll, give the result of action (move of the pawn on the pitch and possession). The defender can play defensive cards (challenge and closed down) which give a result with a die roll (die negative modifier for attack action, foul, take possession of the ball, etc.). When the pawn is near the goal you can shoot (roll dice; you read the result on a chart). All off soccer is here: substitutions, red cards, corners, free kicks,clearance,cross,...moreover the game could easily be modified with houserules. The rating of teams of the beautiful game could be used in the beautiful match.so you can use the beautiful game to play the majority of matchs of the season and the beautiful match to play derby or most intersting matchs.the number of cards is 7 in generic game but this number can be given by a conversion of the rating of the teams given in  the beautiful game.&#10;&#10;",

Monsters may not be the scariest foes you face, though, as you will also be playing against other people who have the same goal as you: survival!&#10;&#10;Be assured that your &ldquo;friends&rdquo; will do whatever they can to protect themselves not only from the horde of monsters, but from any and all of the tricks that you may use throughout the game. At the end of the game, only one player&rsquo;s house will be left standing -- will it be yours?!&#10;&#10;Summary of play: Every turn has several steps including Action, Player, movement/combat, cleanup.&#10;&#10;In the action phase, an action card is flipped and there is a number indicating how many monsters enter the current player's field. Each monster has a lane indicator that tells the player which lane the monster will enter. The field itself is 5 rows by 4 lanes. If ever 2 monsters enter the same lane, the second one pushes the first one farther toward the player.&#10;&#10;In the player phase, the active player uses defenses and tricks to protect themselves or damage other player's fields. The active player always starts their player phase with 5 cards in their hand.&#10;&#10;In the movement phase, each monster moves down the field one tile. If they run into a defense, combat happens and either the monster or defense with the higher power wins combat.&#10;&#10;In the cleanup phase, players finish any effects that need to resolve, remove any defenses or monsters that have been destroyed in combat, and refill their hand up to 5 cards total.&#10;&#10;The player who is the last person standing is the winner!&#10;&#10;",

Ok, that sounds easy enough&hellip; except your opponents have the same orders from their worlds.  Now it is a race and a battle to be the first one there with all of your ships.&#10;&#10;Game Play &amp; How to Win -  Players blast space ships from launchpads and send them racing through the rings of space around Planet 313.  Navigating and battling their way through the rings, they still need to make a perfect landing with all of their ships to claim victory.&#10;&#10;How to make all of this happen--- Players will use 5 dice to roll on each turn. The dice will dictate how much movement the player's ship can travel, whether the rings of space get moved and which one, and finally one of the dice will give a special action that will enhance the turn with different features.&#10;&#10;Players will also be armed with a hand of cards with special actions, modifiers for movement, modifiers for battle values, and even space ships.&#10;&#10;The trip to planet 313 will be full of decisions for best navigation, how to win a battle you didn't want, hunting for the battles you do want, and eventful surprises along the way.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "San Juan is a card game based on Puerto Rico. The deck of 110 cards consists of production buildings (indigo, sugar, tobacco, coffee, and silver) and &quot;violet&quot; buildings that grant special powers or extra victory points. Cards from the hand can be either built or used as money to build something else; cards from the deck are used to represent goods produced by the production buildings, in which case they are left face-down. A seven-card hand limit is enforced once per round.&#10;&#10;In each round (or governorship), each player in turn selects from one of the available roles, triggering an event that usually affects all players, such as producing goods or constructing buildings. The person who picks the role gets a privilege, such as producing more goods or building more cheaply.&#10;&#10;Though similar in concept to Puerto Rico, the game has many different mechanisms. In particular, the game includes no colonists and no shipping of goods; goods production and trading are normally limited to one card per phase; and trades cannot be blocked. Victory points are gained exclusively by building, and the game ends as soon as one player has put up twelve buildings.&#10;&#10;This second edition of San Juan includes all the cards of the original game as well as the additional building cards from the alea Treasure Chest but not the event cards from that expansion. This edition also contains a new building card not previously available: &quot;The Hut,&quot; a building that grants a card when nothing is sold in the trader phase.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "England, a land so harsh that forged heroes and conquerors, where the people are so indomitable that not even the Roman Empire managed to subjugate them. England has built an extensive empire on which the sun never set, vastly extending its domain beyond the British Isles on the spur of the Plantagenets, a royal lineage that dominated much of medieval European history, a dynasty forged from steel and blood, a lineage that would prevail for more than half a millennium. Plantagenet is a name that inspires admiration among enemies and fear among allies.&#10;&#10;Henry II, the first Plantagenet king to extend and stabilize his domains, contracted a political marriage with Eleanor of Aquitaine, a marriage intended to generate heirs to the throne. This strategic alliance by marriage produced four heirs: children who would rebel against their own father, more than once, leading to war, bloodshed and pacification, the stuff history is made of.&#10;Who is going to inherit the throne? Who will prove to be worthy of the illustrious name of Plantagenet? After years of battles and rivalry, only two of the heirs survived.&#10;&#10;The first, opposed by his own father, is a man with a destiny marked out by his own land, which he rarely set foot on as he was preoccupied for his entire life in conquests beyond the British Isles. The hope of an entire era would depend on his choices. The difference between being the usurper or the chosen one would depend on his actions. He is Richard I of England, better known as Richard the Lionheart.&#10;The other, the last born, was far removed from the throne. Overshadowed by his own family, derided by his own people and saddled with the unfortunate title of &ldquo;Lackland&rdquo;, John Lackland had the opportunity of a lifetime: Richard left for the Crusades and John could claim the throne for himself in Richard&rsquo;s absence. But would he have the mettle of a king? Would he surpass his more illustrious brother Richard? Would he be able to counter his brother&rsquo;s supporters?&#10;&#10;A wise choice as to with whom to form an alliance is crucial to one&rsquo;s place in history. Only brave choices will crown the true king of England, and only those who loyally and valiantly supported him in the conquest and administration of the kingdom would be remembered in history. This is a choice that only the strong and the wise would make.This is history.&#10;&#10;In Richard I, the players assume the role of the characters who remained in England when King Richard I left for the Crusades. They have to decide which side to take without knowing whether Richard I will return home a victor with glory and riches, or he won't come back at all (but there are many possible intermediate outcomes).&#10;&#10;During the game, the players take turns to influence the different characters available in order to earn prestige points (PPs) for themselves, but also to use their powers to influence the Crusade from far away by sending resources. A player might even decide to betray his own side, if worrying news were to come from the East...&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the outcome of the Crusade leads to an increase of PPs for the players who were deployed by the faction which has achieved its goal, but the game has only one winner: the player who has accumulated the most PPs, regardless of the faction to which he belongs!&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to amass the most Prestige Points (PP) by wisely choosing alliances and exerting influence on the performance of the Crusade.&#10;&#10;",

In it he sets out to dispel the notion that patience is a therapeutic pastime for the simple-minded and the idle rich. Whereas previous compilations have tended to copy one another in jumbling good, bad, and indifferent games with no sense of order, the author has here adopted a systematic approach enabling the browser to pick out the type of game most appealing to his or her own taste and mood of the moment. Three major groups are distinguished. First come the attractive and simple games requiring care and patience to bring them out, then games requiring a balance of judgement and card sense and finally those which call for the type of positional analysis more usually associated with chess problems than card games. Each group is further subdivided in a way which generally proceeds from the small and simple to the large and complex.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Welcome to the wild lands of Feorhyrna, where grow the world&rsquo;s most desired fruit&mdash;the Royal Strawberry! Servants of the Imperial Court have been tasked with the mission of harvesting this magic fruit from the Emperor's private gardens. Upon arriving at the Imperial compound, however, the servants are chagrined to discover Raiders from the North climbing the walls, hastening to harvest the fabled fruit for themselves.&#10;&#10;In Imperial Harvest, players build a modular board replete with moats and hedges then take turns drafting a unique trio of fantastic champions who will either raid or protect the imperial strawberry patch. To be successful, each player must master the powers of their respective characters, navigate the Imperial Gardens, evade enemy attacks, and collect the majority of the realm&rsquo;s mysterious, magical fruit.&#10;&#10;Imperial Harvest takes place over 7 rounds (less, if all strawberries are plucked before game-end) and takes roughly 20 minutes to play. A cloth play mat is included in the game box for players that prefer not to create their own modular board or who prefer a quicker game setup. Each character in Imperial Harvest features a basic side (for novice/casual players) and an advanced side (for experienced/competitive players). Additionally, all components (garden tiles, character cards, etc.) are 100% compatible with Royal Strawberries (both games are stand-alone but also expand each other).&#10;&#10;IMPERIAL HARVEST: TAG TEAM (allows 2 additional players per additional copy of Imperial Harvest):&#10;Grab another copy of Imperial Harvest, expand your board, and bring a new group of players to the table! With competitive tag-team rules, you and your allies can face-off against a team of worthy adversaries. By pairing skills and chaining more character actions, Imperial Harvest: Tag Team offers new creative strategies for navigating the board and cleverly collecting those precious strawberries. As always, only the craftiest team will win &mdash; and watch out for those hydras!&#10;&#10;",

About a quarter of these people are at Stage 3 of the infection, and the numbers of the &quot;Afflicted&quot; are growing by the day. Cities throughout the U.S. Midwest are emptying as healthier citizens flee for the coasts and roving gangs terrorize the highways. Rumors abound as to the cause &mdash; a madman with a chip on his shoulder, a military experiment gone wrong, and so on &mdash; but if there's any hope for turning back the tide on this illness, someone will need to find a cure. And the best bet for this cure is a small team of survivors unaffected by the virus, searching from city to city as they find and stop the Mastermind behind the Z-B13 virus.&#10;&#10;The pulp-adventure cooperative game Zero Hour balances dice placement with a press-your-luck threat track and risk/reward decisions that add tension on every turn. Combined with an optimistic take on a well-loved gaming theme, Zero Hour flips the zombie genre into an epic quest to find the cure for the Z-B13 virus...all in about an hour.&#10;&#10;",

We could be enjoying our looting in Isla Tortuga but our Captain insisted on coming to this goddamned island instead.&#10;&#10;In the meantime, our gunner &lsquo;Mad&rsquo; Harry does not stop telling us stories and legends about some fantastic creatures that dwell in this place. The Doctor seems uneasy, grabbing the hilt of his sword, sweating a lot more than usual after listening to Harry&rsquo;s tales.&#10;&#10;-Old Sanders lost his leg after having cut it himself. He escaped alive from the jaws of that shark-headed abomination in human form &hellip;- Harry was explaining at the same time he was miming with all his body doing so, acting out the scene with his eyes moving all directions as if they were about to jump off his face, in a way of magnifying the facts.&#10;&#10;-I would not like to lose my leg&hellip;or my arm, or any other limb from my body. I appreciate every single limb and organ of mine- was murmuring the Doctor who was more and more nervous. &ndash;Do you think there will be more monstrosities like those?&#10;&#10;The conversation was interrupted by the sound of two swords pulling out from their sheath together with the cracking in the wood due to a firm step. It was the ruthless Mary Jane who, with a satisfied smile in her face, expressed her wish. &ndash;That&rsquo;s what I'm looking for&hellip;&#10;&#10;Williams the Lookout's logbook.&#10;&#10;Yo ho ho! Skull Tales is an adventure game in which each player performs the role of a pirate character in order to fulfill any pirates' dream: to become the ship's Master and to reach the most precious booty.&#10;&#10;Pirates will have to fight against any kinds of fantastic enemies, by solving mysteries, by sailing the Caribbean Sea and exploring islands... all aimed to conquer the highest score in prestige points (PP) and, of course, to reach the long awaited dream of becoming the Master. How is that? Each character will use different abilities to solve mysteries in each scenario or island (by means of modular boards) to fulfill secondary missions; they will roll dice and play cards in order to move, fight enemies or sail depending of how many PP they still have left. All in a cooperative way to escape alive from all this because dead men tell no tales...&#10;&#10;",

Unbeknownst to the powers in Harrows some of those leaders, namely the players, are secretly evil to the core and in the thrall of the Necromancer. Once away from the bustling city and the oversight of the courts, these overlords create domains that outwardly appear to be beacons of light and hope. Eventually however, their true colors will come through and those upstanding pillars of the community will retreat to their lairs as the masquerade ends and their lands begin to decay into wastelands overrun by foul monsters and nefarious henchmen.&#10;&#10;But all is not peaches and cream in the lands of darkness. Harrows is home to the famous Torin Company and its never-ending supply of heroes and adventurers. Once the word reaches Harrows that darkness is afoot in the Domains, it is only a matter of time before these nosy adventurers begin to seek out the dens of horror to stop the evil.&#10;&#10;Dark Domains is a worker placement game where 2-5 players attempt to create a Domain that provides them the most evil, depicted in the game by skulls. Players must use Minions, Henchmen, Monsters &amp; Magic to stamp out the good, repel the Torin Company and cover their land in darkness.&#10;&#10;Tarot cards are used in the game as events to live up each turn and to regulate the phases of the game.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Antike II is a challenging strategy game about evolution and competition among ancient civilizations. Ancient nations create cities, build temples, sail the seas, and discover new principles of science and technology. Their legions and galleys open new settlements and defend their people against attacks from their enemies. Two scenarios can be chosen as the game board is two-sided.&#10;&#10;Every nation tries to win ancient kings, scholars, generals, citizens, and navigators for themselves. The nation that acquires a specified number (depending on the number of players) of ancient personalities first wins the game!&#10;&#10;Lead one of these nations to victory&mdash;but watch out for your enemies as they will want to conquer your cities to destroy your temples. The game depends not on the luck of dice or cards, but on thoughtful plans and skillful diplomacy.&#10;&#10;Antike II differs from the 2005 Antike in several ways, according to designer Mac Gerdts. To start, players now own city tokens, which allows them some degree of choice as to which resource a newly founded city shall produce. Military units have become more expensive, and the rules for the conquest of cities are considerably easier. The scientific progresses were altered as well. Neutral temples now exist, which may be destroyed, gaining VPs of a general, without harming other players. The game features two new maps in a new graphical design, and a new card named &quot;BELLONA&quot; (the ancient Roman goddess of war) has been introduced to counter the starting player's advantage.&#10;&#10;Gerdts notes that the main goal of all of these changes was to make the rules for a conquest of cities easier, while also opening more possibilities to win the game without the need to attack other players.&#10;&#10;",

In this way each player develops a unique set of resources which will define their play style throughout the game.&#10;&#10;SABOTAGE: Many of the cards have clever effects you can use to manipulate your opponents and gain the upper hand.&#10;&#10;ATTACK: Engage your opponent's spies using vehicles, weapons and more from the arsenal you build throughout the game!&#10;&#10;This is where the tactical fun of Web of Spies happens. With just 5 cards, you have a lot of choices to make. Where will you move? What assets will you acquire? Will you attack now, or wait until the moment is just right? Balancing your efforts between acquiring powerful assets and using them at the right time is the strategy of Web of Spies!&#10;&#10;",

Designed for 15mm figures, opposing forces fight to survive by scavenging supply caches from the battlefield, stripping enemy casualties of their gear, and raiding the enemy field camp. Features include easy to learn rules, small armies of just a few dozen 15mm figures (about 10-12 elements/stands) and a few vehicles, and a flexible force creation system. Create a completely custom force representing anything from a former regular rifle company (and now your personal war band!) to a hardened civilian militia from your hometown. The game uses only standard 6-sided dice and can be played on the average dining room or kitchen table.&#10;&#10;The game is available in electronic and hard copy formats.  Players can use 'extra' 15mm figures they may have lying around or simply reuse miniatures they have for other games to create post apocalyptic warbands with minimal cash outlay.  Players build customized forces and are able to tweak stats, weapons loadouts, morale and other factors to both optimize and personalize their force.&#10;&#10;",

If you become Shaman, your decisions affect events, so your rivals will try to influence you by fair means or foul...&#10;&#10;Your aim is to score the most points by having treasures in your hut and natives in your reserve at the end of the fifth round. Treasures are the key: Each round you collect one from each island on which your tribe has a majority (or a minority, if other tribes are tied there). Cards let you move treasures, place natives on islands, bring them home, or move them between islands. In each round everyone plays one card face up in front of ANY player (including themselves), followed by another card, face down (also in front of anyone). Lastly, you may place one native on any played card &mdash; even a hidden card played by an opponent, if you are very bold! &mdash; to copy its effect for yourself. The background to each card is one of four colors, but in each round only cards of two colors will be resolved, affecting the players in front of whom they are played. The Shaman determines these colors by turning over one of two condition cards. If you are the Shaman, use your power to best effect; otherwise try to outguess the others or influence the Shaman. Remember the number of treasures in other players' huts and manage your natives carefully &ndash; a few points can make the difference!&#10;&#10;Scheming, double-guessing, and bluffing: Welcome to Costa Ruana!&#10;&#10;",

Drug stores have popped up all over town, serving up endless varieties of tasty concoctions. In this &ldquo;take that&rdquo; style game, players take the role of a Soda Jerk at one of these drug stores where they will try to make as much money as they can by bringing in customers who want what they have, while sending soda and customers to other players to try and cost them money. Stealing customers and soda will help but a fire could strike at any time, forcing a player to start from scratch. The game ends when the draw pile is exhausted with the player who made the most money being declared the winner.&#10;&#10;During the draw phase of each player's turn, players draw as many cards as there are players and play each one of them according to their rules. There are four types of cards:&#10;&#10;Customers - Who are brought in by playing them in front of the player who drew them but they can sent to other player's drug stores instead by placing them in front of the other players.&#10;&#10;Sodas - Like customers they can be played in front of the player who drew them or played in front of another player.&#10;&#10;Soda Jerks - Are dealt before the game begins and gives each player a special ability that can be used once per game.&#10;&#10;Events - A variety of events can hurt or help a player depending on which one is drawn.&#10;&#10;",

Plus a Grand Campaign game that covers the entire campaign for the Golan.&#10;&#10;Each copy of No Middle Ground includes a 22&rdquo; by 34&rdquo; map and two sheets of full color, die cut counters that represent brigades from the Syrian and Arab Allies&rsquo; armed forces and the battalions of the Israeli Defense Force. Air units on both sides are potent weapons but must dodge the enemy&rsquo;s AAA and SAMs. Map hexes are 4 kilometers across and each turn represents 8 hours. Plus a well illustrated rulebook and charts, complete with designer&rsquo;s notes and historical commentary.&#10;&#10;Rules for No Middle Ground include, among others, Time-on-Target artillery barrages, Combined-Arms tactics, Improved Positions, Minefields, Airborne and Commando assaults, as well as optional units that could have been deployed by both sides. The interactive, chit-pull formation activation recreates the chaos of battle while still allowing players to deploy and fight their armies.&#10;&#10;",

Who will taste victory?&#10;&#10;You can feel the racetrack vibrating - six of the best racers are fighting for victory today: Larry Leadfoot straightens his helmet, Thea Rocket revs up the engine, Captain Karacho is raring to make tracks, and off they go! The goal of all three game variations is to use the string to flick the vehicles along the racetrack. The player who proves themselves to be the most courageous and most willing to take risks will have the best chance of landing at the top of the podium! A fast-paced, action-packed flicking game for 2-4 players, ages 6-99. A popular and classic HABA game with over 100,000 copies sold in Europe, in a brand new design!&#10;&#10;Sample Game 1:&#10;&#10;How to play&#10;Take turns based on the order of the starting numbers. The player with the lowest starting&#10;number starts and rolls both dice.&#10;What do the dice show?&#10;&bull; Two matching colors&#10; Throw the dice again.&#10;&bull; Two different colors&#10; Take the flicking string and try to flick the race car matching the color on one of the die to&#10;another race car of the other color.&#10;Important: It mustn't come into contact with any another vehicles!&#10;Did you hit the right vehicle, and not touch another one in the process?&#10;&#10;&bull; Yes:&#10; Brilliant! Take the gray trophy and put it on top of your own trophy, then advance one space&#10; towards the target.&#10; Whenever you have successfully flicked, you can choose between two options: &#10;1. Take a risk and carry on: Roll both dice again and continue as described above.&#10;2. Score points and end your turn; put your trophy in the place of the gray trophy and&#10; place the gray trophy back next to the points bar.&#10;&#10;&bull; No:&#10; That's too bad! No points. If the gray trophy is displaying points that you already won, then&#10;you lose these points and the gray trophy is placed back next to the points bar.&#10;The player with the next starting number then takes their turn. Before rolling the dice, the&#10;player must fi rst check to see whether the distance between the sideline banners and the&#10;racing cars is at least the length of the short side of the drift block. If this is not the case,&#10;then the player may move the race cars accordingly.&#10;&#10;End of the game&#10;The game ends when a player managers to reach the last space or beyond on the points bar&#10;with their trophy, and by doing so they win the &quot;Rumble Rage&quot;.&#10;Tips for experienced Rumble Racers:&#10;&bull; Double points: If you roll two of the same color and the gray trophy is already showing one&#10; or more points, then your go will score double points. Drag the gray trophy forward the&#10; exact same number of spaces that separate it from your trophy, then roll again.&#10;&bull; Drifting: If you use the drift block during your fl ick and it works, i.e. the fi rst vehicle bounces&#10; off the drift block before it hits the second vehicle, then you get an extra point and are&#10; allowed to move the gray trophy one space forward.&#10;&bull; Side banner crash: If you touch another vehicle with an outer band, then you do not receive&#10; any points and your turn ends immediately.&#10;&#10;",

All of the pages are blank upon first glance, but soon enough the sorcerers put the pens to good use by starting to paint! The sorcerer's apprentices take turns guessing what is being painted. This is harder than it seems because the whole picture is covered up by bookmarks at the beginning, so the fastest and most imaginative apprentice will be the first one to guess the picture correctly.&#10;&#10;In Zauberer Malefix, the players paint a picture on their easel where the other players can't see it, then they take turns putting their pictures in the magic book while the other players have to guess what they have painted. This is harder than it seems because the whole picture is at first covered up by bookmarks. The bookmarks are gradually unfolded according to how the die is rolled. More and more bits of the picture become visible depending on the roll of the die. The first player to guess the picture correctly receives points, and the less of the picture they can see, the more points they earn. The aim of the game is to be the first player to score the required number of points depending on the number of players.&#10;&#10;",

Let the ghost hunt begin!&#10;&#10;Together in Ghost Blaster, the players try to hit and trap the ghosts with the right amount of goo. Players must roll the dice in sequence and reveal the ghosts using the ghost hunter cards. Once the players have three of the same ghost cards face up, this ghost is caught and can no longer escape. But careful! If the players accidentally uncover a keyhole card, the ghost hunter is caught in the trap and must then go into the dungeon. Players can free him but that takes up valuable time! Their objective is to capture all of the ghosts before the ghost hour is over.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In 2013, Heartland Consumer Products, the makers of the patented Square Shooters Dice, decided to run a contest to find a new game featuring their signature product. There were dozens of entries and the judges whittled them down over three rounds to find the game that best leveraged the dice in a fun new way. That winner was 9-Shooter Quick Draw by Ryan Strong.&#10;&#10;As you might expect with a game about a gunfight in the dusty streets of an old west town, the rules for 9-Shooter Quick Draw (9SQD) are dead-simple.&#10;&#10;Each player gets 3 gunslingers, 3 action cards, and 1 set of Square Shooters&reg; dice.&#10;&#10;Both players reveal a gunslinger and face it so their opponent can see the poker hand printed on the card.&#10;&#10;Both players pick up their dice and shake them in their fists until one player shouts &quot;DRAW!&quot; They both roll their dice and the gunfight begins.&#10;&#10;You're trying to roll the poker hand on your opponent's gunslinger card and you can lock in any of your matching dice at any time, but after that first big roll, you can only re-roll unlocked dice that have...&#10;&#10;The same number (Aces, 4's, Kings, etc...)&#10;&#10;The same suit (Hearts, Clubs, etc...)&#10;&#10;If you have no matching dice, you can only re-roll a single die of your choice.&#10;&#10;If your opponent catches you rolling mismatched dice, you have to stop, give him a hard look, and re-roll a single random die to re-set.&#10;&#10;BTW, Jokers are wild so they can be any number and suit you like.&#10;&#10;That's it. You both keep rolling as fast as you can until one of you locks in all of the dice to match the other's gunslinger card. That player shouts &quot;BANG!&quot; and your gunslinger is dead! Lose all three of your gunslingers and the town's undertaker is gonna be one busy man.&#10;&#10;Hey, quiet down, I hear ya. What about those action cards? Well, if you think you're ready for them I'll clue you in, but these cards are for the experts. It ain't easy dividing your attention between rollin' dice and readin' cards.&#10;&#10;Each action card says when it can be used and what the effect is when it's played. You flip out the card and call out the name, then your opponent has to stop everything and do what the card says. That might mean waiting for you to get in some extra rollin', or maybe having to unlock one die.  Ouch!&#10;&#10;Some of the cards are there to help you, too, like letting you re-roll mismatched dice or canceling the card your opponent just played on you.&#10;&#10;They don't call it the Wild West for nuthin'!&#10;&#10;",

To do this you will compete with the other players for control of four tokens that will let you gain, lose, or otherwise manipulate the dice.

You've heard rumors of a safe house out in the countryside, but you need to find a vehicle capable of getting you there and chances are not all of you will make it. Work with the other members of your group to survive and collect vehicle components, but when the time comes you may have to make a choice: do you run away and leave them for dead, or do you stay true to your word and risk being betrayed yourself?&#10;&#10;Survivors is a semi-cooperative card game in which players search for vehicles they can use to escape while dodging ravenous zombie hordes. On each round, players are secretly dealt 2 zombie cards each and must choose the best action card in their hand to deal with them. This is where you are faced with an interesting choice: do you help the other players and risk betrayal, or do you betray them yourself and leave them to die?&#10;&#10;At the end of each round you will get to search the city for items that help you survive and escape, but even if you find a way out, you may not be able to take everyone with you...&#10;&#10;",

Each player finds themselves abusing their power, and their friends, as they try to take a dominant position, and win the game.&#10;&#10;Addictive Alchemy is a deck destruction, or deck shaping game, where players drink potions a little too quickly, and have to manage their potions, and the side effects that come with them.&#10;&#10;Players start the game with the same deck of cards (potions), and on their turn they will each drink 2 potions. However, those potions mix in their stomach or &quot;system&quot;, and as a result at the start of their next turn they will have a side effect! To make matters trickier their foes can alter their side effects turning something that was intended to be helpful into something harmful, and unexpected.&#10;&#10;",

Whoa!?talk about bringing home the bacon! Some folks appreciate bacon so much they accessorize with bacon earrings or bacon tattoos. Skin yourself up and you can apply a bacon bandage. Tired of that new car smell? Get one of those bacon strip car deodorizers. Bacon is not just for breakfast anymore! Buy your favorite bacon delicacies then collect Pounds of Pork and trade them in for Smokehouses and up the rent. It's all lip smackin' good fun until someone gets sent to BURNT and is out of the game. Who knows? You may soon be praising the Lard and wrapping everything in bacon. Whether you like yours with eggs, on a BLT, or on a stick and covered in chocolate, this is the game for you!&#10;&#10;",

In order to play Battle of the Beetles you need a modified 7 x 7 board with 44 cells, 28 white rings (&ldquo;eggshells&rdquo;) and 28 rounder counters (14 green and 14 red &ldquo;beetles&rdquo;)&#10;&#10;In each turn a player must perform one of the following actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Remove the eggshell from one of your eggs. The removed eggshell is out of the game.&#10;    Capture an enemy beetle. A born beetle makes a capture in two steps: First it moves forward to a cell adjacent to it. Then it flies to a cell occupied by an enemy beetle which removed from the game. The beetle flies exactly as a knight moves in chess. &#10;    Capture a friendly beetle according to the rules mentioned above. This action can only be carried out if the player is not able to perform the aforementioned actions.&#10;&#10;&#10;If a player cannot make any of these actions in his/her turn, he/she loses.&#10;&#10;",

Ethiopian Emperor Menelik II managed to defeat an Italian army through a combination of bravery, deficiencies in the Italian chain of command, and well exploited chances during the battle.The Italian Army fielded Italian infantry battalions, veteran Ascari battalions, and less experienced native units like Ocul&egrave;-Cusai bands and mobile militia.&#10;&#10;The Ethiopian Army was made of provincial armies made up of feudal militia and led by a Ras (Warlord).&#10;&#10;This battalion level game comes with:&#10;&#10;    a map, 216 counters, player aid cards and rules booklet&#10;    map, counters and setup rules for Dogali, a scenario for the Ascari game previously published by ACIES.&#10;&#10;&#10;Will you be able to continue the Italian African Dream by managing your Generals or will you suffer an utter defest?

The tiles can be positive (+1 to +8) or negative (-1 to -10). There are also camel tiles which convert negative values into positive. The last pawn leaving the tile has to take the tile from which it leaves. Sometimes players may or have to move the mummy or guards which provide some meaningful choices to the game. At the end of the game the player with most points wins.&#10;&#10;The base variant may be also extended by four modular expansions included in the game box, which can be added separately or all in once.&#10;&#10;Mumia: Wy&#197;&#155;cig w banda&#197;&#188;ach is an extended version of Verflixxt! (&quot;That's Life&quot;) that contains the whole base game and most components from two expansions: Verflixxt nochmal and Verflixxt hoch 2. The first expansion is included almost 100%, but there are no pawns for 7th and 8th player. Apart from that, the whole Verflixxt nochmal is contained in this version. The second expansion is included partially with risk tiles, a happy green hat and a cursed red cap, but with no movement cards or finish-tile discs.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Of Dungeons Deep (Second Edition) is a vastly expanded version of the original game. It now play 1-4 players and consists of numerous Heroes and Henchmen to choose from to delve in the dungeon below. Here are some game highlights.&#10;&#10;1)Bluffing and Blind Bidding. Players are attempting to destroy the nasty creatures below in the dungeon to gain fame by playing cards face down and revealing simultaneously. Each enemy has a set number of hit points based on the number of players. There are three enemies to deal with in each level of the dungeon, so strategy, tactics, and bluffing are a must. There is also two rounds of bidding so players gain insight into what other players are up to.&#10;&#10;2)Deck Building. When a player defeats an enemy, that card is rotated 180 degrees and then added to the player's discard pile. The bottom of each monster card indicates what item the enemy is carrying. These items add power to your character in future rounds, and act as an organic and thematic way to show that your characters are advancing.&#10;&#10;3)Draft Your Unique Party. Before play begins, players complete a draft in order to create their starting hand of twelve cards. Each player gets one Hero and one Henchman. All characters are very unique and play quite differently from one another. This sets the bar high for replay value!&#10;&#10;4)No Down Time! Since all play is done simultaneously, no players are ever waiting on others for very long. This makes Of Dungeons Deep! one of the fastest dungeon delvers out there.&#10;&#10;",

Your ramp swivels back and forth to help you aim, but it takes a little luck to get it to land where you want it to!

The title means &quot;People's Board Pastime&quot;.&#10;&#10;Players in turn move their pawns by a number of spaces rolled on a single 6-sided die, and follow the instructions printed on the space on which they land.  Most of the spaces have players drawing cards and answering questions in one of four categories; correct answers are rewarded with game banknotes (representing Polish money from before the redenomination in 1990s).&#10;&#10;Other spaces may provide players with money or trigger an auction of scarce commodities (represented by tokens).  When an auction is triggered by a player drawing a card or landing on a certain space, everyone, starting with the player on whose turn the auction occurred, gets to bid for the commodity, to increase their previous bid, or to pass.  Whoever offers the most gets the auctioned item.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all 25 scarce commodity tokens are sold out.  The player who has the most of them is the winner.  In case of a tie, the victory goes to the richest tied player.&#10;&#10;Game can be expanded by an official mobile app with extra questions and digital accessories, available for Android and iOS.&#10;&#10;",

Every modern race knows that these Ancients had fantastic technologies far beyond those now known, and many wish to seize the ship's secrets for themselves.

        "description": "In Skydice we are two architects who are going to build a big city. Each arquitect must erect skyscrapers and improve the city skyline by making them bigger, but we must also try to improve our opponent's buildings in order to claim them as our own. To determine who owns each piece, some parts of the skyscraper will have the lights turned on, while the others will be turned off.&#10;&#10;To achieve this, arquitects must stack dice vertically and horizontally in a fashion that will resemble, at the end of the game, a beautiful skyline with lights turned on and off, like a New York City night postcard.&#10;&#10;The goal is to score more points than the adversary. The final score will depend on the number of skyscrapers we own, their height and the value of the dice. The top dice in each skyscraper is the one which determines who owns the building.&#10;&#10;This game is designed for 2 players (or 4 players playing with 2 teams). Each player must roll 6 dice from their supply and one action dice. The latter indicates which action to play - start a new skyscraper, improve an existent one or demolish, and from the six-dice-roll the player must use only dice with the same value. There is one restriction, though, there cannot be two skyscrapers with either the same height or the same value next to each other.&#10;&#10;Occasionally some special modifiers - King Kong, Godzilla, Hospital... - can be used to protect or increase the value of the skyscrapers.&#10;&#10;Rules incorporate a solo variant for 1 player and another one for 3 players.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;En Skydice somos dos arquitectos que conjuntamente vamos a levantar una ciudad, erigiendo nuestros edificios y mejorando en altura tanto nuestros edificios como los de nuestro rival (que pasar&aacute;n a ser nuestros). Los trozos de edificio de un jugador se distinguir&aacute;n por tener las ventanas apagadas, mientras que los del otro por tener las ventanas encendidas.Apilando los dados iremos formando edificios de distinta altura, de forma que el conjunto de edificios formar&aacute; un vistoso skyline (conjunto de rascacielos) con sus ventanas apagadas y encendidas como si fuera una postal nocturna de Nueva York.&#10;&#10;El objetivo del juego es conseguir el mayor n&uacute;mero de puntos. Para ello, se tendr&aacute; en cuenta el n&uacute;mero de edificios de nuestra propiedad, la altura de los mismos y el valor de los dados de esos edificios. El &uacute;ltimo dado (dado superior) de cada edificio es el que determina el propietario del mismo (jugador con ventanas encendidas o jugador con ventanas apagadas).&#10;&#10;El juego est&aacute; pensado para 2 jugadores (o 4 jugando en 2 equipos) Cada jugador tira 6 dados de su reserva y el dado de acci&oacute;n, realizando la acci&oacute;n indicada en &eacute;ste (construir, mejorar o demoler), para ello deber&aacute; utilizar todos los dados de un mismo valor, a su elecci&oacute;n, obtenidos en la tirada. Tambi&eacute;n se podr&aacute;n utilizar en ocasiones modificadores especiales como King Kong, Godzilla, Hospital... que proteger&aacute;n o dar&aacute;n m&aacute;s puntos a los edificios.&#10;&#10;Las reglas del juego incorporan una variante en solitario para 1 jugador y otra para 3 jugadores.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Imperial-Orion is a print and play derivative of Imperial 2030 by Mac Gerdts.&#10;&#10;It  takes the basic premise of Imperial, that the players are amoral financiers and twists it so that players are shadowy 'powers' in a grand space opera. The game takes its name from the Orion Nebula which is used as the backdrop to the central (neutral) region of human (known) space.&#10;&#10;At some time in the future humans have expanded among the stars. In the more densely populated areas colonies are connected by wormhole networks whilst vast fleets span the trackless expanses of the void. Contact has been made with a number of alien races around the periphery of human space but for the most part this has been peaceful and limited to scientific missions and the exchange of ambassadors. As a generalisation humanity is content, inward looking and exploited - by you, the players of the game.&#10;&#10;This game is played on a board composed of 7 hexagonal tiles, comprising 6 regional powers and a central neutral zone that may have different configurations depending on the episode of galactic 'history' the players choose to replay. Additional part-tiles are arranged around the edge of the board to make the playing area into a regular hexagon. These part-tiles are of 2 different types and can have a significant effect on the topology of the game board.&#10;&#10;In Imperial-Orion the players do not take turns, the six regional powers do, in an order that is determined randomly at the start of each game. The players are shadowy organisations who exercise power through unspecified means to further their own ends. By gaining control of the population of the regional powers,&#10;the players influence the politics. The player with more control over a region's population gains control of that power's government and decides what the it will do. As control of a government can change with each new surge of controlled population, players may be able to manipulate several governments at the same time. As investors, players should not get too attached to a particular regional power, but rather focus on where their 'investments' have the best rates of return. Essentially the game is about power, in all its form: economic, cultural, military, biological&hellip;&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The Seven Years War: Frederick's Gamble (7YW:FG) is a wonderful game based on the innovative and still ever popular card driven game engine from Designer Mark McLaughlin: The Napoleonic Wars (TNW). If you&rsquo;re familiar with TNW or its successor games, Wellington and/or Kutuzov; you&rsquo;ll have little difficulty getting into enjoying this debut Game Design effort by Greg Ticer with game Development by Fred Schachter.&#10;&#10;The game&rsquo;s title stems from Frederick the Great, King of Prussia&rsquo;s 1756 land grab of the independent central European State of Saxony, right on his arch-rival Imperial Austria&rsquo;s doorstep. Frederick &ldquo;gambled&rdquo; he could get away with this annexation without triggering a general European War. He failed, and when Austria was joined by its Ally France (Imperial Camp) and then Prussia's Ally Britain (Coalition&#10;Camp) entered the fray with its mainland interests in  Hanover/Hesse, that European War expanded into one of history&rsquo;s first Global Conflicts.&#10;&#10;To reflect the global nature of this conflagration, 7YW:FG has&#10;&ldquo;mini-maps&rdquo; off to the side of the main European theatre: one for North America and two areas of the Indian sub-continent. These maps use a point-to-point map of &ldquo;Duchies&rdquo; similar to TNW. An abstract &ldquo;Naval Control Track&rdquo; accommodates the war on the waters so players can concentrate on the exciting action ashore.&#10;&#10;There are aspects of the game cards and rules which make this very much an Eighteenth Century, rather than TNW Nineteenth Century, gaming experience.&#10;&#10;Mark McLaughlin is the original game system designer (The Napoleonic Wars)&#10;&#10;Greg Ticer is the designer of The Seven Years War: Frederick's Gamble&#10;&#10;Fred Schachter is the game developer/editor for The Seven Years War: Frederick's Gamble&#10;&#10;",

All that is needed is for you to answer the calling and bring your ships and crew to the stronghold. But beware, there are pirates everywhere. And what pirate can resist an easy treasure, even if it is already on your ship? There are merchant ships to raid but be watchful of the Royal Navy. Be the pirate with the most prestige at the end and you are unanimously elected the pirate king. That is the pirate rule. He who has the most gold makes the rules.&#10;&#10;Overview:&#10;Pursue and Plunder is a strategy game for 2 to 4 players. Each player controls 4 pirate ships in an alcove of 9 islands which each hold various artifacts, items and gold. The players will plunder the islands, establish strongholds and attack merchant ships and each other in order to gain the most prestige. Players also have to avoid the Royal Navy that is patrolling the alcove. The game is played in rounds and at the start of each round each player distributes 7 crew tokens (4 regular crew, 2 drunken sailors, 1 captain) on their game mat secretly behind a player screen. Once all players are ready the screens are removed. Each player then takes 2 actions to move, attack opponents or plunder islands. The success of the actions depend on how the player distributed their crew tokens for the round. Artifact items and experience tokens provide additional flexibility to the actions being performed. At the end of the round, players may upgrade&#10;their cannons and sails, establish strongholds, and train crew to improve their chance of success in future rounds. Players are competing to be the first player to earn a set number of prestige points depending on the number of players. Prestige points are earned by finding artifacts, collecting gold, establishing strongholds and defeating merchants and the Royal Navy.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The year is 1822. After years of decay, it is time to rebuild the medina, located at the foot of the Atlas mountains. The architects and engineers of the city work to erect large and beautiful palaces and to renovate the damaged city wall. As the reconstruction of the old city progresses, the city's inhabitants flock through the alleys, and the contours of the new city gradually reappear!&#10;&#10;Each turn, players must place two pieces on the board (except when allowed to skip this with a tea tile), either augmenting an existing building (or starting a new building if the current building of that color is finished), or expanding one of the other features of the city, like the market or the walls. Each player will claim one building of each of the four colors by the end of the game, giving one point per wooden piece attached to the building.&#10;&#10;Also, if you own the largest building of a particular color you get a bonus for that color. Finally, there are bonuses for palaces around the well, as well as for the player who most recently connected one of their buildings to the walls, which grow from the four corners of the city.&#10;&#10;Medina is a tense game by the great designer Stefan Dorra. This latest edition of the game features a double-sided game board (enabling a two-player game), almost 200 detailed wooden pieces, and updated gameplay, as well as rules and components never before published for this game!&#10;&#10;See Medina for the original edition of this game.&#10;&#10;",

If you are guessed correctly, you are eliminated from the round.&#10;&#10;When there&rsquo;s just one wino left standing, that person becomes wine waiter of the next round.

Each player starts with twelve pieces positioned in the center six columns of their two home rows.&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, pieces can form stacks of two pieces. The player who owns the top piece in the stack owns that stack. Single pieces can move one space sideways or forward. They capture one space forward diagonally. Stacks of two pieces move and capture with the four forward moves of a chess knight. Only the top piece in the stack executes the movement or capture; the bottom piece does not move.&#10;&#10;A player can complete a movement onto either an empty space or a single friendly piece. A capture can be executed onto any enemy piece or stack. In both cases, capture occurs by replacement; the enemy piece is removed and the friendly piece is put in its place. In the case of a stack, only the top piece is replaced.&#10;&#10;The player who reaches the opponent&rsquo;s home row first wins.&#10;&#10;",

After being featured at IndieCade 2014, Circular Reasoning was then picked up by Ad Magic and is now being published under Breaking Games.&#10;&#10;The board consists of a goal in the center and three concentric tracks of 16 spaces each. Each track has a gate to the next level, but the gates rotate around the board according to the number of tokens found in each level.&#10;&#10;Each player gets a square, a triangle, and a circle, which move four, three, or two spaces respectively. In addition to racing toward the center, tokens can be used to block other tokens from using the gates to advance. Because of this, players must predict and work around their opponents moves to secure victory.&#10;&#10;",

Players are dealt a hand of three cards, they then use the illustrations and incomplete words displayed on their cards to figure out what words they are trying to complete. Each player in turn asks another player for a letter card he thinks he needs. If the other player has the card, the first player makes sure the picture match, reads the correct word, and places the two cards face-down to score ten points. If the other player does not have the card, the first player may draw a card, and lay down any matches made. If the first player does not read the completed word correctly, another player may challenge, read the word, and steal the points. Play continues until a player reaches 150 points.&#10;&#10;",

The board has two sides, with separate tracks.  On the Addition side, which depicts a race track, the player rolls two dice, adds the numbers together (the addition practice element) and moves that many spaces.  Some spaces have special effects that can help or hinder.  First player to complete three laps around the track is the winner.&#10;&#10;The subtraction side represents a cross-USA road course.  On this side, players spin the spinner, subtract the number spun from the number on their current space, and move that number of spaces.  This side also features special spaces that can help or hinder players.&#10;&#10;",

Unfortunately, responsibilities prevent him to pursue his ambitions for military expansion. He therefore summons the richest people in the region (the players) to erect the city as well as produce the greatest possible weapons. As a reward, he promises to offer the keys to the city to the best candidate.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: Players will have to send their workers to explore the surrounding regions to discover beds of resources and materials. They will fight for control of these resources, exploit them to construct various buildings, which in turn will enable them to build tools, pistols, rifles and machine guns, aiding them in production or combat. When the General is satisfied with a player, he gives him victory points.&#10;&#10;Goal: Earn the most victory points during the game, the points represent that the General is satisfied with a player.

They then move to the next space of that color on the track (similar to Candyland).  First player to reach the top of the rainbow wins.  There are also obstacles (such as black clouds with rainbow slides) that can set players back.&#10;&#10;This game has an interesting game board.  It is large (20&quot;x26&quot;) and comes as four giant puzzle pieces to be assembled.&#10;&#10;",

Some times this actions are imposible like &quot;wash your brain in oil&quot;, but should do something to satisfy Goo Zman.&#10;&#10;Each player takes 2 cards (or 1 if there are more that 13 players), this cards must not be shown to other players. Only the player that gets the card named Goo Zman, reveals it so all players can see it.&#10;The goal of this player is to find as many Power Morfys can, and adquire the highest points posible, avoiding &quot;Skulls&quot; and negative cards. To do so, he must pick one player at a time to show one of his cards (the picked player choose one of his cards). Gooz Man will loose if he gets -25 points.&#10;&#10;The players must decide if they want to help Goo Zman, or not. Since &#10;they can persuade him to being pick with lies or helping him giving clues to who he should pick, but never reveal their cards until they are picked by Goo Zman. If the player choose to show a negative card, this player will win if Gooz Man loose. If the player choose a positive card, the player will win if Goo Zman wins. When a player already had a picked card and must show his other card, the new card will be his win chance.&#10;&#10;There is also an special card named &quot;Diabolo&quot;, this player will only win if he is not picked.&#10;&#10;It's a very fun and crazy game that can last from 1 minute to 20 minutes.&#10;&#10;",
