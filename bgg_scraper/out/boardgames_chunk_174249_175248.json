        "description": "Cheerful Polynesians live where the sun always shines, the ocean creates vast noise, and the houses are right on the water. Not only are they skilled hunters and craftsmen, but also nimble traders. As the head of one of these Polynesian tribes, your task is to attract as many villagers as possible to your tribe. Market day takes place infrequently for the islanders, but when it does come, it attracts many merchants.&#10;&#10;In &#208;&#159;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#187;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#189;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#183;&#208;&#184;&#209;&#143;, you are attempting to purchase fish, turtles, masks, and flower garlands in order to hire patrons to your village and become the richest tribe in Polynesia. Each turn, the active player will roll four dive (each one with values of 1,2,3,4,5, and 8) that will set the market values of the four products for that round. Then, you will exchange your expensive goods for multiples of cheap goods, trying to get the best combinations of goods that let you attract patrons from the marketplace.&#10;&#10;Your patrons, once 'purchased,' will come to your village where you will lay them out. As you progress through each of the three seasons of the game (there are three rows of four), you are trying to earn the most points from your patrons by stacking similar patrons, earning points from totem masks, and getting all three types of patron in one season. Your goal at the end of the game is to become the richest tribe in all of Polynesia!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Vampire Radar is a battle between vampire and humans, with 8-9 human pawns starting the game on the square grid map. The vampire is invisible, so there's no vampire pawn, but he IS somewhere on the map. The only clues are from radars. When a human uses a radar, the humans get to know how far the vampire is from the radar. With the clue from the radar and guessing his moves, humans shoot their guns blindly, trying to damage the vampire.&#10;&#10;Before all bullets are spent or all humans are killed, if the vampire's life is reduced to zero, the humans win. The vampire wins when he kills all the humans or when the humans are out of bullets.&#10;&#10;The second edition of Vampire Radar has nine 2x2 tiles instead of 36 1x1 tiles, making for faster set-up, and it includes variant rules for the human players. Instead of each human player taking two actions, then the vampire acting twice, each human player takes one action, then they pass the starting marker clockwise, then each human takes another action, then the vampire acts. This change rotates the turn order among the humans.&#10;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#180;&#227;&#130;&#161;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#128;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#229;&#175;&#190;&#227;&#131;&#180;&#227;&#130;&#161;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#230;&#160;&#188;&#229;&#173;&#144;&#231;&#138;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#171;8&#239;&#189;&#158;9&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#233;&#167;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#189;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#167;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#131;&#180;&#227;&#130;&#161;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#232;&#166;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#233;&#167;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#229;&#148;&#175;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#128;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#128;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#189;&#191;&#231;&#148;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#180;&#227;&#130;&#161;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#183;&#157;&#233;&#155;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#128;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#131;&#180;&#227;&#130;&#161;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#139;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#142;&#168;&#230;&#184;&#172;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#153;&#154;&#231;&#169;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#144;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#233;&#138;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#146;&#131;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#166;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#131;&#180;&#227;&#130;&#161;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#148;&#187;&#230;&#146;&#131;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#229;&#188;&#190;&#228;&#184;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#176;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#133;&#168;&#230;&#187;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#229;&#137;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#180;&#227;&#130;&#161;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#146;0&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;(This game was first published with an English title &quot;Vampire Rader&quot;.

The continent has been bought and broken in two by experiments of a powerful corporation Cerbero. Now it kneels divided waiting for the fall. The government is non-existent and so are any laws of men. Desolated wastelands are roamed by mutated beasts, decades-old machines running on corrupted software and degenerate humans who are  even more dangerous. In those few pockets of civilization left people are more interested in survival than in progress. Values like compassion and responsibility are scarce &ndash; even scarcer are fuel and ammo needed to face new reality. But things are about to change as there are still those who care. Will you muster enough hope to fight for better future? Will you stand tall and shine the beacon of your courage in this darkest of times? The Waste is calling &ndash; better be ready to answer&hellip;&#10;&#10;Waste Knights is a post-apocalyptic adventure game for 2-4 players set in dystopian Australia now called the Waste.  Each player becomes a hero who travels around the continent fighting monstrous enemies, accomplishing Tasks to acquire new Gear Cards and hoping to gain enough Reputation in order to fulfill the Mission being played. All players share a common goal set by the Mission, but only the quickest and the most cunning will manage to win!&#10;&#10;Waste Knights features unique rules&rsquo; systems. Players need to manage 4 different resources: Fuel, Ammo, Health and Radiation as reaching a certain level in any means almost certain death in the Waste. They move using different Vehicles, face threats shown on Wasteland Cards and explore various locations on a modular, hexagonal map that is formed of 37 hexes. Combat is both deadly and rewarding as players set the range, utilize Combat Cards with different maneuvers and have various melee and ranged weapons at their disposal. Additionally the Waster, the person opposite the active player, controls the game to some extent choosing threats and making combat decisions for enemies.&#10;&#10;But Waste Knights is not only about fighting and moving. Players progress by accomplishing Tasks &ndash; short quests given by inhabitants of the Waste. Some of them require tactical acumen, others are based on Skill tests or getting certain goods. Finally, a unique barter system allows players to trade Gear Cards of different colors as in the post-apocalyptic future there is no currency system whatsoever. Thanks to this some players will win by strength while others by brains &ndash; and all will have a good time playing!&#10;&#10;",

Each player begins with 6 cards consisting of armor pieces and weapons that are played one at a time in front of the player, then the rest of the hand is passed either clockwise or counterclockwise (depending on game round) until all but 2 cards have been played. Then each player has the opportunity to swap out one piece of their assembled armor for what remains in the hand they are passed to complete their set. The remaining cards are discarded and everyone compares armor values, which are increased or decreased by certain affects on each card. The player with the highest value wins, simply because they can take more of a beating than the others. Cards are then shuffled and dealt for another round. Play as many rounds as you like, but we recommend 1 round per player +1 round, best out of that number wins!&#10;&#10;",

Greeks, Italians, Arabs, French, and Spanish all mixed together on the island. Rarely did the ruling king live on the island. Instead, leaders, such as barons and dukes, were appointed to govern the island.&#10;&#10;One such leader, the Baron Beneamato, governed the territory of Sicily. In his advancing years, he wanted to ensure that his people were governed by a good leader&mdash;a person they trusted and loved. So rather than pass his sovereignty to his evil son, he proclaimed that the people would decide who would become the next ruler. The island would now be governed as a democracy.&#10;&#10;The players in this game are potential candidates for the throne, trying to earn a majority of support, by influence, strategy, or force. You must also learn to avoid or control the Innominato (the un-named), a secret society predating the modern Mafiosi, who will thwart any ruling power.&#10;&#10;You all start out in your home village with minimal support and very little transportation. You must work to increase your transportation speed, out guess your fellow players to earn more support of the people, avoid duels with other players, and work out your strategy to succeed. Will you quickly try to grab the smaller villages through education? Or prove your dedication to larger villages with food and wine? Will you earn the trust of a certain region or try to please everyone in all regions? Or will you spend your resources for the benefits of Potenza cards?&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Napoleon&rsquo;s Last Gamble contains five battles from the Waterloo Campaign, which Napoleon began by seizing the central position between the Prussian and British Armies. On June 15th the Grande Arm&eacute;e was unleashed across the Sambre River. Allied screening forces sent out the warning to headquarters. The Allies executed a forward concentration behind the cover of their screens. As the 16th dawned, troops of both sides still converged on the battlefields.&#10;&#10;Napoleon's Last Gamble is one of the games from OSG's Series: The Library of Napoleonic Battles (OSG) series. Details on the series are below, as all the games share a common rules set and game system.&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS&#10;&#10;     Two 22x34&quot; maps &#10;     One 17x22&quot; map &#10;     560 die-cut counter units &#10;     100 playing cards &#10;     two rulebooks &#10;     15 Player aid cards &#10;     covered in a box &#10;&#10;&#10;BATTLES SIMULATED&#10;&#10;Quatre-Bras, Ney at the Crossroads, 16 June &#10;The French attacked on two fronts simultaneously.  The tenacious defense of Quatre Bras by the Anglo-Allied troops saved the Prussians from receiving the full weight of the Arm&eacute;e du Nord.&#10;&#10;Ligny, The Last Victory, 16 June &#10;Finally unleashed, the Guard pushed the Prussians back from the Ligny brook. Bl&uuml;cher himself was wounded and separated from headquarters. But Napoleon&rsquo;s hoped-for knock-out blow remained undelivered.&#10;&#10;Wavre, Grouchy&rsquo;s Blunder, 18 June &#10;Napoleon separated the two wings of his army, ordering Marshal Grouchy on the track of the Prussians while he pursued Wellington.  Grouchy&rsquo;s prescribed route was wide of the mark, and took him to the outer flank, allowing the Prussians to interpose themselves between the two French wings&mdash;Bl&uuml;cher achieved a strategic reversal of the opening.&#10;&#10;Waterloo, A Near Run Thing, 18 June &#10;While Grouchy frittered away time engaging the Prussian rear-guard at Wavre, Ney conducted the mid-phase of the battle like a rear-guard action in the Peninsular Campaign, failing to provide infantry support for his spectacular cavalry charges. Wellington fought a successful defensive battle, managing to cling to his ridge until the arrival of three Prussian corps. The broken French army retreated toward Charleroi; Grouchy&rsquo;s intact wing moved south-east toward Namur.&#10;&#10;La Souffel, Rapp&rsquo;s Last Stand, 28 June&#10;Three days after Waterloo, Rapp woke up and began a slow withdrawal from the Rhine, pursued by the vanguard of Schwarzenberg's Army. On June 26 the heavily-outnumbered Rapp skirmished with the Austrian III Corps. Two days later he made a stand along the Souffel River, and the Austrians attacked.&#10;&#10;DESCRIPTION&#10;&#10;Series: The Library of Napoleonic Battles (OSG) - formerly known as the Napoleon's Last Battles (NLB) Series: &#10;&#10;     480 meters per hex, &#10;     1 hour per turn, &#10;     400-800 men per strength point. &#10;&#10;&#10;Each Approach to Battle game lasts about 22 turns. The Full campaign links the individual battles.&#10;&#10;(Text mostly from the OSG pages)&#10;&#10;",

If Players do not have cards in their hand, they may slap the center three piles if they see a match. A match may be made by slapping three of the following combinations: three of the same color of top symbol, any three same parts of a symbol regardless of color, and the whole symbol matching regardless of color. Slapped matches or missed matches are removed from the board quickly and play is continued. Color matches score one point, part symbol matches score two points, whole symbol matches score five, and missed matches are scored minus two.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Wild West Exodus is a table top miniatures game set in a sci-fi filled 1800's America. Technology and greed rule the old west. Wild West Exodus: Unfinished Business introduces 4 new factions to the game; The Confederate Rebellion, Dark Nation, Golden Army, and The Watchers.&#10;&#10;About The Confederate Rebellion:&#10;The Confederate Rebellion army has seen death and destruction ravage their states.  Beaten by the Union during the Civil War, the leaders of the Confederate States of America have abolished slavery and joined forces with all men and women of the South.  Their fight against a stronger and more advanced enemy has ignited a strong love of state and government.  The CSA generals fight side by side with their men and want nothing but the complete destruction of the Union army.  They use surprise assaults and gorilla warfare to even the odds against much more powerful foes.  Their men and women are supplied by Dr. Carpathian Industries allowing access to deadly and corrupt weapons.  Rumors of Voodoo magic and the undead fighting alongside Rebel troops have been whispered about for years.&#10;Wild West Exodus is a Sci-Fi Wild West Miniatures Game set in an alternate history wild west. Strange technologies corrupt the land and death lurks at every corner. RJ-1027, the infamous power source created by Dr. Burson Carpathian is the catalyst behind the constantly escalating arms race between the factions that make up Wild West Exodus.&#10;&#10;About Wild West Exodus:&#10;Wild West Exodus is a miniatures game played by 2 to 4 players in control of the faction of their choice.  In the world of WWX, every model has the potential to be a hero or a villain.  The game mechanics and rule set feature exciting game play from the first dice roll.  Each player will be allowed to field a posse of 6 to 60 models or more.  The WWX rules have been designed to allow for scaling of the game to high or low model counts without causing rules issues.&#10;&#10;One of the most exciting parts of the Wild West Exodus game mechanic is the reusable influence pool.  The influence pool will give players the option to gamble away a set amount of tokens in return for a reroll of the dice.  Be careful what you gamble on because once the tokens are committed they are lost for that turn.  The D10 system gives the game life and options that round out easily and allow for quick decision making.&#10;&#10;The Halo that each model possesses creates an area of assault around the miniature allowing for fast and deadly close combat.  This helps move the game along quickly and gives each fight a more cinematic feel.&#10;&#10;Wild West Exodus also benefits from an alternating 1-3 model activation system.  This system lets both players choose the most strategic way of advancing their characters across the battle field.  This means that you never have to wait more than a minute or two before taking control of your own posse for your next activation.&#10;&#10;Each posse consists of a structured army list.  All factions will have 1 Boss model, 0 to 4 Underboss models, 0 to 8 Sidekick models, and an endless amount of Hired Hands.  Heavy and Light Support vehicles also make up an army list.&#10;&#10;This really gives the gamer the option to field a force led by one mighty general commanding a horde of troops or the complete opposite.&#10;&#10;Some gamers may choose to load up on skilled Sidekicks and Underbosses or go heavy on Hired Hands for a true horde army.&#10;&#10;No matter what option you take, the world of Wild West Exodus will engulf you in fun and excitement from your very first game.&#10;&#10;",

This game is loosely based on the traditional Chinese/Japanese game Sugoroku.&#10;&#10;In this game, players choose a character from the Naruto manga and then roll a die to move their characters along a track.  Some spaces have instructions that only affect one character--other characters may ignore the instructions.  If two players land on the same space, they play rock-paper-scissors, with the loser moving back one space.  Various &quot;stage&quot; spaces along the way allow a player to roll a die and move all other players back that number of spaces or to jump ahead is a one a rolled twice consecutively.  Certain events can put a player into a &quot;passive state.&quot;  While in a passive state, players are protected from most negative effects.  The last part of the path splits so each character has their own individual track.  Players must roll the exact number to land on the ending space, and must move back any excess spaces.  First player to arrive there wins.&#10;&#10;",

Each player chooses an animal and takes the five pieces (head, body, forelegs, hind legs and tail).  The body parts are depicted tiles, which are laid out face-down.

If it is not a part of their animal, they return it to the same spot face-down.  The first player to completely assemble their animal wins.&#10;&#10;",

Categories test your knowledge of carols, movies, the North Pole, traditions and stocking stuffers.&quot;&#10;&#10;In Christmas Trivia Game, each player tries to correctly answer two questions in each of five categories (or one of each, for a quicker game).

The card is then replaced at the bottom of the card stack.  Play continues until one player has answered the designated number of questions.&#10;&#10;",

The player with the highest answer wins and takes all the cards.  If a player's answer is wrong, he or she gives her card to the player to the right.  A wild card automatically gains all the cards in that round for the player who plays it.  Like in wars, equal answers result in a &quot;war&quot; where players play two face-down cards and the an face-up card, and the winner wins all the cards.  Players play a predetermined number of times through the deck or until one player has all the cards.&#10;&#10;",

The game features a resources management aspect in the building of the base and its staff as an effective task force, plus a detailed handling of casualties according to their medial triage level, having to be treated in different medical modules.&#10;&#10;The game prototype is currently playable as print-and-play or using a Vassal Game Engine Module (see Files section). The Vassal Module supports an Observer player for a tutorial session or online shared play.&#10;&#10;During the game, the player will recruit new personnel for the base, also improving its installations. The game engine will challenge the player with events and the need to fulfill missions to score points. The scarcity of resources will test your judgement as the base commander, having to prioritize, push-your-luck and even to make hard sacrifices.&#10;&#10;From the rulebook:&#10;&#10;Nha Trang, Vietnam. November 1967. Orders come from Long Binh HQ.&#10;You are assigned to 498th Medical Company, 55th Medical Group, 44th Medical Brigade, as Battalion Surgeon with the rank of Captain (O-3). Your duty is to set up and manage a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH), to be deployed as part of the Counteroffensive Phase III Campaign.&#10;In order to do so, you will be recruiting Personnel (specialist operatives and general personnel), and commissioning new buildings and vehicles (installations). With those assets, you will face threats to your facilities (events) and be called upon to participate in military operations (missions).&#10;Sometimes you will be ordered to take wounded people into treatment in your Base. Wounded people will also flow your way as a result of enemy opposition during missions, and sometimes in the case of security, health or supplies threats to your Base. Having a poorly managed Base, forfeiting missions, and suffering casualties will reduce your promotion merits. Stay sharp, or your men will suffer and you&rsquo;ll never make it to Major (O-4).&#10;Taking part on the campaign operations (your combat readiness), along with an overall good security, healthiness and supplies situation in your Base will grant you promotion merits (victory points).&#10;Godspeed, Captain!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Wild West Exodus is a table top miniatures game set in a sci-fi filled 1800's America. Technology and greed rule the old west. Wild West Exodus: Unfinished Business introduces 4 new factions to the game; The Confederate Rebellion, Dark Nation, Golden Army, and The Watchers.&#10;&#10;About The Golden Army:&#10;The once famous explorer Ponce de Leon and his conquistadors were subjected to a mix of Watcher blood and tropical jungle water.  What they call the fountain of youth has now kept them alive for hundreds of years endlessly searching for the source.  Their influence over the Mexican people and robust army has pushed them to the door step of the country&rsquo;s boarder.  The men of the Golden Army know of only one thing.  Fight until dead or until the enemy is destroyed.  This horde faction sends endless supply of men to battle.  They are led and protected by the destructive weapons of the conquistadors directing  them from the rear.  They will soon push across the border ready to destroy any army that stands in their way.&#10;&#10;About Wild West Exodus:&#10;Wild West Exodus is a miniatures game played by 2 to 4 players in control of the faction of their choice.  In the world of WWX, every model has the potential to be a hero or a villain.  The game mechanics and rule set feature exciting game play from the first dice roll.  Each player will be allowed to field a posse of 6 to 60 models or more.  The WWX rules have been designed to allow for scaling of the game to high or low model counts without causing rules issues.&#10;&#10;One of the most exciting parts of the Wild West Exodus game mechanic is the reusable influence pool.  The influence pool will give players the option to gamble away a set amount of tokens in return for a reroll of the dice.  Be careful what you gamble on because once the tokens are committed they are lost for that turn.  The D10 system gives the game life and options that round out easily and allow for quick decision making.&#10;&#10;The Halo that each model possesses creates an area of assault around the miniature allowing for fast and deadly close combat.  This helps move the game along quickly and gives each fight a more cinematic feel.&#10;&#10;Wild West Exodus also benefits from an alternating 1-3 model activation system.  This system lets both players choose the most strategic way of advancing their characters across the battle field.  This means that you never have to wait more than a minute or two before taking control of your own posse for your next activation.&#10;&#10;Each posse consists of a structured army list.  All factions will have 1 Boss model, 0 to 4 Underboss models, 0 to 8 Sidekick models, and an endless amount of Hired Hands.  Heavy and Light Support vehicles also make up an army list.&#10;&#10;This really gives the gamer the option to field a force led by one mighty general commanding a horde of troops or the complete opposite.&#10;&#10;Some gamers may choose to load up on skilled Sidekicks and Underbosses or go heavy on Hired Hands for a true horde army.&#10;&#10;No matter what option you take, the world of Wild West Exodus will engulf you in fun and excitement from your very first game.&#10;&#10;",

However, the pull on its people has consumed many of their warriors, and the Dark Council has influenced even the strongest of their leaders.  With the corruption spreading like a virus, the shape shifting Warrior Nation men and women become trapped in a half animal half human form left to walk the land as deformed creatures with no home.

Each pair consists of related words, e.g., BEE&mdash;H1VE, BIRD&mdash;NEST, etc.&#10;INSTRUCTIONS TO M.C.&#10;PREPARATION FOR PLAY&#10;Tear each sheet along the perforations so that there are 168 slips in all. The first halves are distinguished from the second halves by the spot in the top right c&oacute;rner of the former.&#10;Distribute the second halves about the house or hall with the printed faces upwards and retain the first halves.&#10;List the players by name or number on a score sheet.&#10;Give each player a &ldquo;first half&rdquo; slip.&#10;HOW PLAY PROCEEDS&#10;At the word &quot; GO &rdquo; the players set off to find the counterpart of the slips they hold. A player does not know what the word is, but on seeing the words on the &ldquo;second half&rdquo; slips he will recognise the one he is looking for by its close connection with the word on the slip he is carrying.&#10;When a player beiieves he has found the correct counterpart he presents the two slips to the M.C.; if correct the M.C. records one point for that player and gives him another slip.&#10;If during the game a player presents an incorrect pair of slips to the M.C. he must resume looking for the correct counterpart and is not given another &ldquo;first half&rdquo; slip until he finds it.&#10;OR&#10;If he cannot l&oacute;cate the counterpart and would prefer to have another &ldquo;first half&rdquo; slip, he is entitled to do so but one point is deducted from his score.&#10;THE WINNER is the player who scores the hlghest number of points in an agreed time or when the whole of the slips have been used.&#10;The material in each packet provides for about eight young people. If more are taking part extra perforated sheets should be obtained.&#10;The game can be varied by distributing the first halves and giving the players the second halves.&#10;SOLUTION SHEET&#10;On this are listed the correctly paired words.&#10;N.B.&mdash;The pairs of words have been so chosen that there should be little doubt in a player&rsquo;s mind as to whether he has found the correct counter&not;part.&#10;&#10;",

Place these at suitable distances apart about the room (attach to walls, !f convenient).&#10;Look at the Key Sheet and you will note that a girl's Name heads each list. Now the idea of the game is that the girl is friendly in turn with each of the boys whose names follow and finally marries the young man whose full name is made up of the first letters of the Christian names reading from top to bottom of the list and the wedding date is that at the foot of the list.&#10;&#10;By filling in his recording card as instructed below a player is able to make a list exactly the same as that on the key sheet corresponding to a particular girl's name.&#10;&#10;Suppose we take the name Barbara. Write Barbara in the first space of a recording card; then look for Barbara in the left columns of the Names Lists and on finding it write in the second space the boy's name opposite in the right column, i.e. Roland. Next find Roland in the left column of a Names List and write in the third space the name opposite, For example - lan. Continue in this way until the date June I2th is found opposite Stuart and entered in the last space alongside the word WHEN.&#10;Now enter the first letters of each name recorded in the column headed &quot;FIRST LETTER&quot; and it should then be fairly easy to divide them into two groups giving a Christian name and surname. Write them in the space alongside the word WHO.&#10;&#10;Give each player a recording card and see that he has a pencil.&#10;To begin the game call out one of the girls' names on the Key Sheet and the player who is first to present a correctly completed recording card is the winner.&#10;&#10;An alternative way of playing is to write in the first space of each recording card to be used, before the game starts, the name of a girl and at the word &quot; GO &quot; each player completes his card in respect of the girl whose name appears on it.&#10;&#10;",

You win the game when you reach maximum of your career level before other players do.

Working hard will get you closer to promotion, but even more close to burnout - that is why sometimes you need to relax during working hours. When relaxing, you are at risk of being denounced to superiors by your fellow players. What is more &ndash; each time a denouncing person proves right, his or her career thrives.

When a new mining location is discovered, each company sends out a fully robotic mining base. Before mining begins, the companies attack each others bases. When only one base is left standing, the victor gets exclusive rights to reap the benefits.&#10;&#10;Players play as one of the companies and try to build their own base while eliminating the competition. The last player with a base still standing wins. The base game mechanism involves laying cards in a grid to form a &quot;base&quot;. Each card or &quot;Module&quot; acts differently. The five base cards are the solar panel, the turret, the repair bot, the ray shield and the processor.&#10;&#10;",

Submissions opened in April 2014 and closed in October 2014. Each person was allowed up to 3 character submissions (with only 1 character per person allowed to win), detailing their character's appearance, lore and play style.  Finalists were chosen by the Level 99 team to be turned into full, tournament legal characters in their own boxed set!&#10;&#10;This set will be standalone with its own box, board, rulebook and characters, the same size as BattleCON: Fate of Indines.  The set will be completely compatible with all previously released BattleCON sets as well.&#10;&#10;All winners have been notified and many have made themselves and their winning submissions known, but they have not yet all been officially listed.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Tide of Iron: Next Wave was released under license by 1A Games in 2014. It is the second edition of Tide of Iron (which was first released by Fantasy Flight Games in 2007).&#10;&#10;Tide of Iron: Next Wave and Tide of Iron are essentially the same game. Overall, Tide of Iron: Next Wave is much more informative and organized. The rules are improved with corrected errors which make it better than the rules found in the 2007 edition. Also, a few of the scenarios have been adjusted for better game play. These and other improvements make this edition better than the older edition. Also included in Tide of Iron: Next Wave are some additional and useful items that were later introduced to TOI in some of the game expansions. Because of these differences, the two products have different entries on BoardGameGeek. For more information about the older 2007 version of Tide of Iron, you can Click Here.&#10;&#10;Tide of Iron is a game of World War II tactical conflict for two to four players. The components in this base game allow players to simulate the dramatic struggle that took place between American and German forces in Northern Europe during the years 1944 and 1945.&#10;&#10;Tide of Iron is a scenario-based game, with the available forces, objectives, map, and victory conditions being set by each given scenario. It features loads of plastic figures, including soldiers, equipment, heavy weapons, and combat vehicles, cards, dice, cardboard markers, and modular game boards that will represent the customizable terrain of this scenario-based wargame.&#10;&#10;The twelve double-sided map tiles, plus the dozens of included terrain hexes, allow for limitless potential combinations, and each scenario can be enhanced by special rules, objective markers, troop allotments, and other variations. The only limiting factor is your imagination!&#10;&#10;",

During the game the players have the opportunity to build their own automatic helpers!&#10;&#10;Each player starts with seven cards on hand. Those cards may contain different parts of robot, 200 and 300 money bills as well as special actions. In the middle of the table players place three stacks of different bonus cards.&#10;&#10;The gameplay is divided into players turns, during which they can perform one of four different actions. The player may put one of his cards with a part of robot to bidding. The person that gives the highest price for it has to place it in front of himself, adding it to the robot he is building. The next action that may be performed is putting one of the cards from hand to the players bank, in order to store money. The players may also buy bonus cards from the middle of the table or play the special action cards from hand. When one of the players builds the complete robot, the game finishes and the points are summed up from the built robots and fulfilled bonus cards.&#10;&#10;The goal of each player is to build the most valuable robot and at the same time to thwart the opponents&rsquo; plans. Due to the necessity of bidding and possibility of playing the special action cards the gameplay is filled with negative interaction so enjoyed by many players.&#10;&#10;",

If he throws a useless figure he passes the shaker to the player on his left who shakes and plays accordingly, but if he has thrown a useful number then after collecting a letter he throws again until his is unsuccessful, when he passes the dice on. (This prevents crowding round the letter boxes).&#10;&#10;When all the letters are used up, or at the end of an agreed time the 3 members of each team get together and make up as many words as possible (plural nouns not counting) from their letters, bearing in mind the following method of scoring.&#10;A word of 6 letters or more ...    Scores 20 points&#10;A word of 5 letters scores 15 points&#10;A word of 4 letters scores 10 points&#10;A word of 3 letters scores 5 points&#10;&#10;A time limit of 5 minutes or so should be fixed for composing. The team scoring the highest number of points is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Lost Bible is a take on the game Lost Legacy with the story and characters from the game Bible Hunter. It contains two sets of 16 cards: The Dead Seas Scrolls and The Last Supper. It also contains a promo card for the latter, Crucified Christ.&#10;&#10;It plays the same way as the previous games in the Lost Legacy family. However, unlike the other sets, the cards in this game may not be mixed and matched with any of the previous sets as they have a different card back bearing the Lost Bible title.&#10;&#10;Rules Summary&#10;&#10;Lost Bible is a game of risk, deduction, and luck for 2&ndash;4 players. You start the game with one card in hand from a deck of sixteen cards. On a turn, you do the following:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Draw: Draw the top card from the deck and add it to your hand.&#10;     Play: Choose one of the two cards in hand to play and place it face up in front of you.&#10;     Effect: Carry out the played card's effect, after which the card is considered as discarded.&#10;     End: If there is at least one card left in the deck, the turn goes to the next player; if not, the investigation phase starts. Using the investigation speed indicated on the card each player has in hand, players take turns guessing which player (whether yourself or someone else) holds the &quot;Lost Bible&quot; card; this card might also be in the &quot;Ruins&quot;, a location that holds one card at the start of the game and possibly acquires more cards during play. The player who guesses correctly wins; if no one finds the &quot;Lost Bible&quot; card, then everybody loses.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Players will take on the role of a wandering adventurer with their own special set of skills and their own reasons for traveling to this dark corner of the world. Players must work together out of necessity to clear out menacing dungeons and forgotten ruins. In the process, they will enhance their abilities with experience and loot, discover new locations to explore and plunder, and expand an ever-branching story fueled by the decisions they make.&#10;&#10;This is a game with a persistent and changing world that is ideally played over many game sessions. After a scenario, players will make decisions on what to do, which will determine how the story continues, kind of like a &ldquo;Choose Your Own Adventure&rdquo; book. Playing through a scenario is a cooperative affair where players will fight against automated monsters using an innovative card system to determine the order of play and what a player does on their turn.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player chooses two cards to play out of their hand. The number on the top card determines their initiative for the round. Each card also has a top and bottom power, and when it is a player&rsquo;s turn in the initiative order, they determine whether to use the top power of one card and the bottom power of the other, or vice-versa. Players must be careful, though, because over time they will permanently lose cards from their hands. If they take too long to clear a dungeon, they may end up exhausted and be forced to retreat.&#10;&#10;",

In this quick and interactive game, two players build their teams as they play, combining both strategy (building your team) and tactics (playing the game) without any of the downtime. During each &quot;mini-game&quot;, each player alternates playing six cards to simulate a full game's highlights. The mini-game includes defensive and offensive actions, and your single card play may include elements of defensive and/or offensive plays. Do you try to thwart your opponent's pending hits, put up strong offensive action of your own, or use your better players to do both? Players buy new free agents after each mini-game to improve their roster, and the team who wins the most mini-games in the series is the champ!&#10;&#10;The deluxe edition of Baseball Highlights: 2045 comes with all five initial expansions (Coaches, Rally Cap, Hitters, Pitchers, Magna Glove) already included.&#10;&#10;",

Then, each player in turn must perform two actions: 1. add one of her discs to an empty cell or move one of her discs on the board into any ring located in a neighbor cell, and 2. add one of her rings to an empty cell or move one of her rings on the board to a neighbor cell occupied by a disc. The disc-ring pair (a disc inside a ring) cannot be modified for the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;The game ends the moment that a player establishes a chain of her discs or rings connecting the two opposing sides of the board marked by her color.&#10;&#10;",

Each player also has three secret targets they must eliminate, without being discovered. The players have two actions each turn from the following choices: move any character anywhere on the board, eliminate a character (different ways of doing this), or make an identity check by the police. The trick is that when a character is eliminated, nobody says by whom or how! You must apply yourself in blending your true hitman in a crowd of possible suspects, or guess which character is the hitman of the other players.&#10;&#10;As time goes by in 10' to Kill, you will feel pressure and suspicion weigh on your shoulders. Ten minutes is a short time, but it can sometimes be very long when all eyes are on you! You'll have to bluff and use discretion to eliminate your targets...and maybe the competitor's hitman!&#10;&#10;Are you ready to become the most prestigious hitman?&#10;&#10;",

Power Management is crucial in the game as you will need to mine for Power Coins to obtain enough energy to run your empire.&#10;&#10;The cards have beautiful and colorful imagery right out of 1950s science fiction. Players will easily get emerged into the genre of the game.&#10;&#10;Game Play:&#10;Each turn, players spend their Power Coins (earned by minting or mining or landing on Mining Moon cards)to bring out fighters like Robots or Monster Mercenaries that can attack opponent's. Building a strong Base (Base cards form the back row on tabletop) allows players to shoot Long Range Weapons, Use Force Fields for extra defense, and create Power Coins. Players can customize their draw decks to follow different strategies and playing styles. A player looses Life Points when attacking fighters are not blocked. When a player reaches zero Life Points, they are out of the game.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In a place where politics, magic and science are covered in a heavy layer of coal dust lies the world of Steam Court. Steam Court is a 1&ndash;12 player card game that mixes elements of traditional trick-taking, with character based abilities and victory point win conditions.&#10;&#10;Steam Court is a game of Victorian hierarchy where the more powerful your position, the greater your opportunity in the game. You'll want to try and hold onto the throne, but don't play your cards right and you'll end up serving the lousy Tea Boy. Each round, players rotate position at the table, and depending on their seat they gain/lose privileges. Even though the game is stacked in favor of those at the top, the luck of the deal, use of special cards, and player strategy are guaranteed to make it interesting.&#10;  &#10;There are multiple variations on how to play, but the typical game involves four rounds of cards and usually takes around 60 minutes.&#10; The original artwork, intriguing theme, and clever game play will have you ratcheting for the top in Steam Court.&#10;&#10;Goal: get rid of the cards in your hand before other players do. There are many strategies you can employ do this, but the most common is to be the controlling player to start the trick. The player who wins the trick starts the next trick. This allows you to decide how many cards of the same number you will play. Then all other players must match the quantity of cards played and also beat the number that is on the cards. For example, if a player lays three 1s, then the next player must lay three cards of a higher number - like three 2s or three 3s. What gives this game an extra dimension are the variable character privileges. Each Engineer is granted a different privilege by their Courtier that can be employed at the beginning of the Quarter or throughout the game. For example, the Duke can lay matching numbered cards instead of having to play higher numbered cards on a set of cards.&#10;&#10;End of the Quarter: After everyone's cards have been played the Quarter ends and players re-seat based on the order they went out in (first player out becomes the Queen, and so on). They then gain the privileges of a different character for the next Quarter.&#10;&#10;7-12 players: When playing with a large group a new element is added to the game -- a second table full of Renegades. Players who do poorly in the Royal Court are banished to the Renegade table, while the top two engineers at the Renegade Table are promoted to the Royal Court. In Steam Court, anything can happen. The lowest of low can climb to the top, or the Queen&rsquo;s engineer can wind up working for the vagabond.&#10;&#10;",

Each player draws four cards, and then one person takes the top four cards of the deck and places them face up in a row next to it. Decide who goes first.

Dandy has gone and used the Aloha Oe's broken warp drive and managed to converge every possible alternate universe into one, causing multiple copies of everyone in the known galaxies to run amok! What does this mean for our intrepid heroes? Will all semblance of civilization fall into disorder and chaos? Will the universe, under the weight of so many simultaneous timelines, implode on itself into a cosmic Big Bang?&#10;&#10;Well. Maybe. But for now it means the Alien Registration Center has reset the database and is allowing new registration of all previously registered aliens! That's cold, hard Woolong just out there for the taking, baby!&#10;&#10;The Space Dandy: Galactic Deck-Building Game brings the bizarre space-faring antics of the hit anime series seen on ADULT SWIM TOONAMI to the game table. It's similar to other Deck-Builders like Dominion and Ascension&mdash;with an extra helping of phantom space ramen goodness. Each player begins the game with the same rather low-powered starting cards, but through careful play, you can acquire more to expand your options. Which cards you choose to take directly influence the kind of game you play!&#10;&#10;Cards can grant new abilities, make it easier to acquire new cards, allow you to take extra turns, or even destroy cards from the game altogether! But the most important cards are the aliens. Not only can they improve your hand just like any other card, they can be played Planetside and directly attack the other Player. Why fiddle around endlessly with your deck when you can stick it to them and mess up their carefully laid plans? That's the Dandy way to play!&#10;&#10;Even more importantly, aliens are how you win! When you register aliens, they are removed from play, but you get to score precious, precious Woolong that you need to win the game. But be careful! It can be difficult to decide if an alien is more useful in your hand, on the Planet, or in the Alien Registration Center's bank.&#10;&#10;That&rsquo;s not to say the other cards aren&rsquo;t important, too! Effect Cards cannot be registered OR played Planetside, but they let you manipulate the game to your advantage. Sick of that really great card the opponent keeps playing? DESTROY IT! Changed your mind about the card you played Planetside? WARP IT BACK! Keep your opponent&rsquo;s on their toes with your carefully constructed (or hazardously haphazard) deck!&#10;&#10;You can also fill out your space crew with other humans (and the occasional robot) that can&rsquo;t be registered as aliens (obviously). But never fear! They make up for the lack of Woolong delivery with unique abilities of their own!&#10;&#10;So register those aliens, earn all the Woolong you can, and may the Best Dandy Win!&#10;&#10;",

Each class has unique strengths and weaknesses, so you can always find a character that matches your play style.&#10;&#10;Team up with other players to take on challenging foes, or try to go it alone and reap all the rewards for yourself.&#10;&#10;Game play is structured so that everyone gets to do something meaningful on every turn. There's even a handy &quot;Rules Card&quot; that both keeps track of whose turn it is AND serves as a reminder of all the turn phases, turning a potentially complex turn into something that anyone can understand!&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to level up your character to level 5 or collect 30 gold. You level up by gaining experience from defeating monsters. In each turn players can commit their characters to fight one of the enemies, buy/sell equipment, spawn new monsters or heal themselves. Players can join forces to attack enemies together and share the prize, but only if the first attacker agrees, so there's an element of negotiation involved. Additionally players have equipment and action cards at their disposal which allow them to boost their stats and perform additional actions. Monsters are defeated by comparing your characters and the enemies attack/defence stats modified by the result of a dice roll.&#10;&#10;",

The remaining 2 cards compose a cipher of the treasure cache. A player wins the game by specifying the correct numbers of these 2 cards.&#10;&#10;Each card has its own ability to help gain some clues about the treasure cache. But using the ability comes with a risk of revealing clues to other players. Players have to weigh the risk and the benefit when playing a card.&#10;&#10;When a player is sure they have enough clues, it's time for them to declare the codes. The player wins if they are correct. If another player says they have one of the declared numbers, the declaration fails. The declared player misses one turn, but they don't get eliminated, and at least they gain a clue that another player has one. Therefore players may declare codes without enough clues, and experienced players will find out other benefits from early declaration.&#10;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#230;&#142;&#168;&#231;&#144;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#131;&#150;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;1&#239;&#189;&#158;14&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#149;&#170;&#229;&#143;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#155;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;14&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#128;&#129;12&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#157;&#135;&#231;&#173;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#233;&#133;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#230;&#174;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;2&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#232;&#178;&#161;&#229;&#174;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#154;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#230;&#137;&#128;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#164;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#230;&#154;&#151;&#229;&#143;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;2&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#149;&#170;&#229;&#143;&#183;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#173;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#232;&#168;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#229;&#189;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#231;&#139;&#172;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#138;&#185;&#230;&#158;&#156;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#178;&#161;&#229;&#174;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#154;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#230;&#137;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#233;&#150;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#231;&#155;&#184;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#184;&#142;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#228;&#187;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#189;&#191;&#231;&#148;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#233;&#154;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#184;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#229;&#191;&#133;&#232;&#166;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#229;&#141;&#129;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#231;&#162;&#186;&#228;&#191;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#154;&#151;&#229;&#143;&#183;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#174;&#163;&#232;&#168;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#154;&#151;&#229;&#143;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#173;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#230;&#173;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#130;1&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#178;&#187;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#132;&#177;&#232;&#144;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#2

trap in the shadow of your deduction&quot;). You lead your pirates and try to decipher the codes for the treasure cache. Your goal is to be the first player who identifies and declares the 2 correct numbers out of 14 candidates. You have more than one chance to declare, so you don't always have to declare the direct answer. Hide your true intention when you declare.&#10;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#230;&#142;&#168;&#231;&#144;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#189;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#231;&#189;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#187;&#149;&#232;&#190;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#128;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#232;&#132;&#177;&#232;&#144;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#230;&#142;&#168;&#231;&#144;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#230;&#181;&#183;&#232;&#179;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#190;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#128;&#129;14&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#232;&#178;&#161;&#229;&#174;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#154;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#230;&#137;&#128;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#164;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;2&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#170;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#230;&#151;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#232;&#167;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#230;&#152;&#142;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#230;&#140;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Advent Saga is a story-driven physical and digital Tactical Card Game that combines the excitement and traditions of popular card games, with the strategic elements of Tactical RPG's. The game takes place in an original universe where a devastating war is waged upon 3 different galactic factions. Players will choose from hundreds of cards to battle with, while discovering endless possibilities in combat strategy.&#10;&#10;Advent Saga is a highly customizable game, in that each of the 5 resources have their own strengths and weaknesses, while each of the 10 advents have unique abilities that set them apart from each other. This allows you to build a deck to cater to your own style of play! The object of the game is to reduce the opposing Advent&rsquo;s morale to zero. This can be achieved by strategically using the cards in your hand to deploy, attack and dominate your opponent.&#10;&#10;One goal with Advent Saga was to add elements that rewarded meaningful choices over just drawing powerful cards. With the creation of our 4x4 battleground, players would not only need to rely on strength and power, but would also need to discover and develop new strategies involving Battleground position, Range, areas of effect, and much more.&#10;&#10;",

In the Adventure Time episode &quot;Card Wars&quot;, Jake begs Finn to play his favorite trading card game. Finn accepts, despite warnings from Beemo on how very competitive Jake can be while playing the game. Finn and Jake battle against each other to decide who will be the Dweeb and who will be the Cool Guy.&#10;&#10;Now fans can play the actual Card Wars game in Adventure Time Card Wars: Lemongrab vs. Gunter, with all of the action taking place in four combat lanes.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player has two Action Points to spend on Creatures, Spells, and Locations, and cards cost between 0 and 2 Action Points to play. When you summon a Creature, you choose which lane you want to place it in; some Creatures have FLOOP abilities that allow you to use their special abilities. When you attack with a Creature down a lane, you might find an opposing Creature, or you might get to deal your damage straight to your opponent's Hit Points. Reduce your opponent's Hit Points from 25 to 0 and you're the Cool Guy (and you win the game)!&#10;&#10;In Adventure Time Card Wars: Lemongrab vs. Gunter, The Earl of Lemongrab and his sour disposition take on the cool as a cucumber penguin, Gunter! Lemongrab's deck contains cards that utilize SandyLands and Cornfield Landscapes. His new strategies include giving his opponent bad Creatures that take up space and mess up his opponent's combat phase. Keeping your opponents Creatures alive might just be your key to victory! You will also find new &quot;bounce&quot; Creatures that can enter and leave play at a moment's notice. And this deck can mess with your opponent's Landscapes!&#10;&#10;Gunter&rsquo;s deck utilizes IcyLands and Blue Plains Landscapes. As a penguin, Gunter likes to hang out on the ice. Now he can! His deck has brand new ways of putting Frozen tokens on Landscapes...and this time, he might want to freeze his own! When his Creatures occupy Frozen Landscapes, they will be much more powerful. Of course, if he wants to get rid of the tokens he will need a lot of cards in hand. Blue Plains is still the king of card draw. Blue Plains is also the best at moving Creatures between Landscapes. You will find that ability very useful with Frozen tokens hanging around! You will also find some very powerful Blue Plains Creatures that must move each turn, or suffer the consequences.&#10;&#10;Each Card Wars starter set has a pair of different forty-card decks and is ready to play right out of the box. Mix the decks together to come up with your own righteous combos!&#10;&#10;",

You must balance your efforts between sponsoring knights (who may yield you honor and glory) and managing the subtle manipulations of the king&rsquo;s court after each day&rsquo;s battles.&#10;&#10;Lavish the powerful with gifts, ply the gullible with a tapestry of empty promises, publicly humiliate your rivals, or back the people&rsquo;s champion in the arena -- nothing matters except royal favor, and if your enemies are dragged down in the process, well&hellip; they knew the risks.&#10;&#10;King's Tournament is a card-driven game that sets a random assortment of unique knights onto a play mat styled after a single-elimination tournament. Gameplay centers around the ebb and flow of two recurring phases: the action- and auction-based Festival Round and the card dueling-oriented Tournament Round.&#10;&#10;Festival Rounds are play-or-pass affairs wherein players use actions, cards, tokens, and written abilities to sponsor knights, sabotage their foes, or benefit from the tournament in more subtle ways. The Tournament Round follows, during which the knights battle one another using their printed attributes and special maneuver cards played by their patrons. Victorious knights advance further down the bracket, and a new Festival Round begins afterward.&#10;&#10;Play continues until a single knight has been crowned the tournament's champion, at which point players compare the favor tokens earned over the course of the game. Bonuses are doled out for reaching certain conditions, and the player with the most favor tokens is then declared the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Once in a while, the players' courage is tested to take a reckless chance.&#10;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;1&#233;&#128;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#231;&#180;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#170;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#230;&#151;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#229;&#159;&#142;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#177;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#10;&#233;&#129;&#142;&#233;&#133;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#157;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#233;&#153;&#184;&#230;&#168;&#170;&#230;&#150;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#230;&#167;&#152;&#227;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#229;&#156;&#176;&#229;&#189;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#185;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#232;&#182;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#10;&#229;&#164;&#154;&#231;&#168;&#174;&#229;&#164;&#154;&#230;&#167;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#228;&#185;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#228;&#185;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#231;&#182;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#185;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#137;&#128;&#230;&#156;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#185;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#228;&#185;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#129;&#184;&#230;&#138;&#158;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#231;&#148;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#231;&#132;&#161;&#232;&#172;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#232;&#179;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#229;&#139;&#135;&#230;&#176;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#232;&#169;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Legendary Encounters: A Predator Deck Building Game is based on the first two movies of the Predator series. Taking on the roles of characters from the films, players take turns recruiting cards for their deck from a central selection in order to improve their deck and defeat Predator cards that are added to the central game board.&#10;&#10;In more detail, within the setting for each film you can play as the humans or as the Predators. As the humans, you play the co-op version of the game as in Legendary Encounters: Alien, recruiting, scanning and attacking the same way while trying to achieve objectives. When you play as the Predators, the game is player vs. player instead of co-op, with each player assuming the role of a Predator hunting for the most honor (VPs).&#10;&#10;Legendary Encounters: A Predator Deck Building Game is a standalone game in the Legendary Encounters series that is fully compatible with Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game. Specifically, you can use the Predator deck in Alien or the Alien deck in Predator. Similarly, Predator is also compatible with the Marvel superheroes version of Legendary but cannot be fully integrated.&#10;&#10;",

        "name": "Orcs Must Die! The Board Game: Order Edition",
        "description": "The award winning game Orcs Must Die has made its way to the table top! Orcs Must Die: The Boardgame dares you to preserve your stronghold sieged by orcs. You have traps &amp; weapons galore, and can team up with your friends to obliterate the nasty orcs and their grotesque allies.&#10;&#10;Orcs Must Die: The Boardgame includes scores of figures of favorite heroes, plus hordes of orcs, crossbow orcs, kobolds, gnolls, trolls, ogres, and more. Build an exciting fortress using a tile-based system, then watch as swarms of baddies plunge through your defenses to abolish your Rift.&#10;&#10;Orcs Must Die: The Boardgame  actually consists of TWO separate games! One is based on the heroic Order, while the other is for the Unchained. Both are complete stand-alone games. In Order, you&rsquo;ll play heroes such as Maximilian the War Mage, Gabriella the Redeemed Sorceress, and others, while fending off the villainous orc onslaught. In Unchained, you play opposing heroes, such as the Kobold King or Midnight the assassin, facing down assaults by human soldiers, lions, elves, bears, dwarfs, and the like.&#10;&#10;How Is It Played?&#10;First, you and your friends choose your heroes &ndash; each individual game supports 1-4 players, who must co-operate to survive the enemy onslaught. Each hero has his own individual sheet, with his unique characteristics, special ability, and his secret superpower, that he needs to save for just the right moment. He also comes with his own special figure and his own weapon cards that no one else has access to.&#10;&#10;When you think you are ready to go, choose a difficulty level, and a map &ndash; you can select one of the maps we&rsquo;ve included, or create one of your own! A typical map is made up of from 4 to as many as 13 tiles (or even more, if you are inventing your own design). The game has a lot of pieces to play with, but the map itself is reasonably tight, and will fit just fine on a typical gaming (or dining room) table.&#10;&#10;Finally, the fight begins! Each turn, waves of orcs and other monsters move pitilessly through the map, relentlessly aiming for your poor Guardian, trying to destroy him and your Rift. You and your allies run around the map, placing traps in the various parts of your map, battling the invaders, and performing a host of other actions.&#10;&#10;You earn trophy skulls for killing your enemies, and these act as the game&rsquo;s &ldquo;cash&rdquo; &ndash; spend them to buy new weapons, magic amulets, and a host of other items. You also can spend skulls to place traps, and to upgrade your Guardian, making him better-able to hold off the orcs, gnolls, and other enemies.&#10;&#10;But over time your enemies accrue in strength, too! You have to face three Onslaughts, and with each Onslaught, your foes increase in might. If you do not lay a solid groundwork for your defenses with upgrades and trap placements in the early part of the game, you may face doom later on!&#10;&#10;Combat is straightforward and fast &ndash; you roll various colored dice depending on what type of weapons and upgrades you own. Remove &ldquo;killed&rdquo; enemies from the map, only to see them replaced by new waves each turn. The fun continues. The game builds up over time to a crescendo of doom, in which the last few turns see you frantically try to finish off the final waves of the onslaught before your crippled Guardian is destroyed!&#10;&#10;Head-to-head play?&#10;If you or your friends own both the Order and Unchained versions of Orcs Must Die: The Boardgame , you can go head-to-head, pitting the regimented Order against the legions of the Unchained in an epic conflict. You and your friends will split into two teams &ndash; one side fights for the Order, and the other will control the Unchained.&#10;&#10;Each side has its own heroes, its own armies, its own Items, and its own traps. Your hero can defend your own citadel, or seek to lead your armies to victory inside the enemy lair. With friends to help, your faction can station heroes at both tasks, and even switch off duties. The game supports up to 4 players per side.&#10;&#10;",

All squadrons participating in maneuvers have image of a tiger in their emblem. The first such exercise was held back in 1949.&#10;&#10;This is a game for 2 or 4 players. Each player has one base with airport. In the base are anti-aircraft guns, ammunition depot, radar, ... The game has 3 levels. In the first level are light attack aircrafts and fighter-bombers. In the second level supersonic attacker aircrafts are added, and in the third level interceptors are added. The planes are armed with guns, bombs, Air to Ground missiles and Air to Air Missiles.&#10;&#10;The main characteristic is that the game board is covered with a net of equilateral triangles. Vertices of these triangles are points at which the players hold position and move figurines.&#10;&#10;Each player has a task to achieve as many hits as possible in the enemy bases. Every hit and shot down aircraft counts as one point. The game lasts as long as players have planes and bombs, missiles... The winner is the player who has the best ratio of given and received hits.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "ION: A Compound Building Game is a card drafting game where players select from a number of available Ion Cards and Noble Gas cards with the goal of creating sets of compounds and inert noble gases.&#10;&#10;Here&rsquo;s how the game is played: Each player is dealt eight cards, must select one of those cards and then passes the remaining. Players must choose to either bond (pair) their selected card with another Element Card or set it alone (possibly to form an ionic bond at a later time). Throughout the game, players gain additional points for building specific compounds which are listed on the Compound Goal Cards and have available a set of Action Tiles which award them additional moves throughout the game. Players score points based upon the quantity and type of neutrally balanced compounds they construct and noble gas sets they collect. After three rounds, players add their total scores from each round, subtract points from Action Tiles used, and the player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;",

But beware - your opponents are brewing schemes of their own!&#10;&#10;Apotheca is played on a 4x4 grid. Players gain points by making matches of three potions of the same color in a row. The first player to make three matches wins. It's easily learned, but the combination of asymmetric powers and secret facedown potions make the game a delicious challenge.&#10;&#10;On each turn, players take 2 of 4 possible actions:&#10;&#10;    Reveal: Reveal a secret potion and gain a gem of that color&#10;    Restock: Draw, look at, and place secret potions on the board until there are exactly 3&#10;    Power: Use one of your active apothecary powers&#10;    Hire: Spend gems to hire new apothecaries&#10;&#10;&#10;Whenever a player makes a match, they must place it on one of their apothecaries. This removes that apothecary's power for the rest of the game, so it's important for players to keep revealing potions, collecting gems and hiring new apothecaries... all while keeping their opponents at bay!&#10;&#10;Deduction is key to Apotheca. Players trap each other with clever spatial moves, bluffing and misdirection. The action economy is very well balanced, so every turn offers an opportunity for strategy and tough decisions.&#10;&#10;The feeling of the game differs with every number of players:&#10;&#10;    2 player is the most cerebral and controlled&#10;    3 player is the most chaotic, yet still within your grasp&#10;    4 player is played in teams, offering neat collaborative gameplay&#10;&#10;&#10;",

A game will last 6 - 12 turns or with a variable turn system.&#10;&#10;Each player is a regimental commander who controls 4 - 9 companies. All companies are color coded &amp; under command of a battalion HQ. A HQ can issue orders to three companies (three colors). Platoons of same color are from same company which should share same morale &amp; training. Morale of a company will vary from scenario to scenario.&#10;&#10;Air-support, OB artillery, reinforcement, mines, snipers, hidden units, weather change &amp; other unexpected battlefield events will be handled by cards. Leadership will be implemented by command points &amp; cards.&#10;&#10;There is also a solitaire mode in which a player will play as a fictional regimental commander who will do daily routines like refit, replace units or send units for patrol &amp; recon when there is no action. Enemy force is unknown until first contact. Your regiment will gain more &amp; better resources if you proof yourself in battle. If you see too many casualties, you may request to retreat from battlefield &amp; end the battle of the day but withdrawal request is not always permitted depending on the overall battle situation.&#10;&#10;There is a battle-fatigue system. As a regiment commander, you choose which of your one/two battalions or attached companies will be upfront for attack or defense mission. The company will get one fatigue point for mission without contact and two fatigue points for contact with enemy force after each mission. A company's morale will drop by one if fatigue point is 2 or more. So you need to decide whether to send more troops upfront or call troops back for refit to remove fatigue points.&#10;&#10;",

Race into the valley and fight with the other players over a herd of sheep. Play cards to stop the others from advancing or weaken them while you make yourself as strong as a shepherd can be.&#10;&#10;Each player plays a card for himself and for another player face-down. Then the cards are turned face-up and the effects are resolved. The cards can either make a player stronger/faster or they can have several weakening effects. After that you move your figure towards the valley where the players fight over the sheep by comparing their modified fighting skills. The strongest ones take a sheep home, just to start another race towards the valley next turn until no sheep are left. The one who collected the most sheep wins.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Cards: The Attackening! is a limited collectible card game (LCCG) for 2 - 5 players. Games take anywhere from 15 - 45 minutes, depending on how many people are playing. The game works on a system of sharing decks. I.e., instead of everyone bringing separate decks, there are three decks in each copy of the game from which every player draws. Specifically, Cards: The Attackening! consists of an Attackener deck (characters); Arsenal deck (Pets, Weapons, Armor, Evasions, and miscellaneous Items); and Twists of Fate (scenarios that affect gameplay - e.g., SciFi Attackeners gain a certain advantage while attacking.).&#10;&#10;The game is played by every player drawing three Attackeners, three Arsenal cards, playing their first Attackener and then rolling to see who draws and plays the first Twist of Fate. The player with the highest roll chooses three Twists of Fate, and choosing the one that benefits them the most. That player then draws one Arsenal card, plays one, and attacks an opponent by rolling a die. Damage is determined by the amount rolled (1 is a miss, 2 is half damage, 3-5 is full, and 6 is double). If the opponent does not evade the attack, they take the damage and the move is passed to the next player, who follows the above steps to complete their turn.&#10;&#10;When an Attackener's health is depleted, the person who beat that Attackener collects the card as a trophy. The person who was beaten chooses the next Twist of Fate, but does not play their next Attackener until it is their turn to play. This gives them a few rounds of immunity while play continues. The game is over when one player has collected three trophies from any player in the game.&#10;&#10;",

La Ciudad is founded in 1553 as commercial distribuition of the wool here produced. Since 1648 Lanolinas is a Spanish Royal Colony, till the indipendence, declared on 19th March 1891.&#10;&#10;As independent republic, Lanolinas is influenced by the US and knows a period of dictatorship, ended in 1969 by the Marxist Revolution of Ignacio Las Casas.

Just as he hopes, Simba and Nala head for this forbidding place, where a pack of hungry hyenas await them.

Along the way, they may land on spaces that move them forward or backward or cause loss or gain of turns.  If a player lands on another marker, they move back six spaces, and in order to start moving a marker at the beginning of the game, they must roll at least a three.  The book comes with an &quot;electronic&quot; die that generates random number from 1 to 6. A small element of strategy is added by the ability to move either marker, offering the choice to move the marker that will land on an advantageous space or avoid a negative space.&#10;&#10;",

However, you must help her to get to him before the last petal of the Enchanted Rose falls, or the Beast will never become a prince again.&#10;&#10;Published as part of Disney's Giant Board Game Book, Beauty and the Beast is a roll-and-move game where players take the part of Belle, rushing to save the Beast.  Each player in turn presses the &quot;electronic die&quot; and moves the indicated number of spaces along the track.  Each player also has a marker on the rose board, indicating petals falling from the enchanted rose.  As they move along the track, they will land on spaces that may move them forward or backward or cause loss or gain of turns.  Landing on another player's marker moves a player back 2 spaces.  Players landing on spaces marked with a rose must move their marker one space forward on the rose board.  The first player to reach space 42 by exact roll without their rose board marker reaching the end of the rose board rescues the beast and wins.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Prepare yourself for the bizarre as you venture deep into a world of radioactive insanity!&#10;&#10;Wasteman: A game of desperate conflicts in a desolate future! A frantic game, set amongst the ruins of a neglected and scorched earth. Engage in desperate battles between post-humans, hideous monstrosities and killer robots over the dregs of an age of gluttony. Take control of you own syndicate and test your metal against the weird and terrifying denizens of the wastes!&#10;&#10;Wasteman is a fun, easy to learn, and refreshingly crazy game! Players or 'comrades' control syndicates, typically comprised of between 5 and 20 ruthless denizens of the wastes, in an attempt to vanquish their opponent, survive bizarre encounters and/or capture much needed supplies.&#10;&#10;During a game of Wasteman, comrades take it turn to activate individual figures to perform several actions; such as attacking, moving, hiding or even bringing people back to life with the power of their mind in some cases! Figures can normally only be activated once per turn so you have real scope for strategy &ndash; goad your opponent into activating the wrong figure at the wrong time and they could be left open to all sorts of cunning shenanigans!&#10;&#10;Once a syndicate drops below 5 figures they become desperate and the restriction for activating a figure only once in a turn is lifted. This leads to some really cinematic moments, where often lone survivors hopelessly attempt to fend off hordes of enemies and occasionally succeed! This really keeps the game fun right until the last man.&#10;&#10;Figures take different kinds of damage &ndash; they can be spooked, crippled, seriously injured, or killed outright. To make it easier to remember what&rsquo;s happened, each figure comes with a base equipped with slots and removable tokens. These are cast in high quality resin and are included with all but the largest figures. Each figure will receive 1 base out of 10 designs selected at random.&#10;&#10;M.A.D cards really bring the crazy to the game! Each comrade receives a hand of 5 M.A.D cards that can be played at any time (for the most part) to either help yourself or hinder your opponent. There&rsquo;s nothing quite like having the enemy boss abducted by aliens just before riding a conveniently timed tornado to the objective on the last turn! Though normally limited to 5 cards, you can seek the aid of traders or vending machines to top up your hand during a game leading to some very tense moment as your prize fighter sits in the middle of the battlefield kicking a coffee machine.&#10;&#10;The cards themselves are lavishly illustrated by yours truly, and beautifully printed on quality playing card stock.&#10;&#10;As well as a myriad of rules for hazards, mods to alter the game and a stockpile of scenarios, Wasteman has an in depth syndicate creation system, with loads of equipment, skills and Boss Rosters to choose from. Although each figure comes with a stat card, you are more than welcome to create your own and/or combine figures from different posse packs &ndash; the choices are vast!&#10;&#10;Wasteman miniatures are sculpted by hand to approximately 35mm scale and will be cast in metal, unless specified to the contrary. All figures will come with stat cards and token slot bases. They will be supplied unpainted and, in some cases, unassembled.&#10;&#10;",

The Game begins shortly after the United States of America (USA) and Mexico have begun hostilities near the border of the Rio Grande. The Mexican Army is now building up their forces to kick the United States out of Mexico. The US must capture enough Mexican controlled Settlements before the Mexican Army is able to effectively mobilize an overwhelming force.&#10;&#10;OBJECTIVE: Player takes command of the United States Forces in Mexico. The Player&rsquo;s Objective is to attempt to capture three or more of the five Key Mexican Controlled Settlements of Monterrey, Buena Vista, Vera Cruz, Tampico and Mexico City before the &ldquo;Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo&rdquo; Campaign Card is Drawn. If the Mexicans capture 3 of the four US Settlements of Fort Texas, Laredo, Corpus Christi or San Patricio, they win. Also, if the US has not captured three of the four Key Mexican Settlements and the &ldquo;Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo&rdquo; Campaign Card was played, the Mexicans Win.&#10;&#10;GAME FEATURES: Mexico Ablaze features many colorful game counters of the various Unit types that fought in the Mexican War, including individual Heroic Officers that later served in the Civil War. Battles can be fought on a large Battle Mat and includes assaults on fortified settlements.&#10;&#10;MEXICO ABLAZE can be found at http://www.berserkergames.net&#10;&#10;",

        "name": "Orcs Must Die! The Board Game: Unchained Edition",
        "description": "The award winning game Orcs Must Die has made its way to the table top! Orcs Must Die: The Boardgame dares you to preserve your stronghold sieged by orcs. You have traps &amp; weapons galore, and can team up with your friends to obliterate the nasty orcs and their grotesque allies.&#10;&#10;Orcs Must Die: The Boardgame includes scores of figures of favorite heroes, plus hordes of orcs, crossbow orcs, kobolds, gnolls, trolls, ogres, and more. Build an exciting fortress using a tile-based system, then watch as swarms of baddies plunge through your defenses to abolish your Rift.&#10;&#10;Orcs Must Die: The Boardgame  actually consists of TWO separate games! One is based on the heroic Order, while the other is for the Unchained. Both are complete stand-alone games. In Order, you&rsquo;ll play heroes such as Maximilian the War Mage, Gabriella the Redeemed Sorceress, and others, while fending off the villainous orc onslaught. In Unchained, you play opposing heroes, such as the Kobold King or Midnight the assassin, facing down assaults by human soldiers, lions, elves, bears, dwarfs, and the like.&#10;&#10;How Is It Played?&#10;First, you and your friends choose your heroes &ndash; each individual game supports 1-4 players, who must co-operate to survive the enemy onslaught. Each hero has his own individual sheet, with his unique characteristics, special ability, and his secret superpower, that he needs to save for just the right moment. He also comes with his own special figure and his own weapon cards that no one else has access to.&#10;&#10;When you think you are ready to go, choose a difficulty level, and a map &ndash; you can select one of the maps we&rsquo;ve included, or create one of your own! A typical map is made up of from 4 to as many as 13 tiles (or even more, if you are inventing your own design). The game has a lot of pieces to play with, but the map itself is reasonably tight, and will fit just fine on a typical gaming (or dining room) table.&#10;&#10;Finally, the fight begins! Each turn, waves of orcs and other monsters move pitilessly through the map, relentlessly aiming for your poor Guardian, trying to destroy him and your Rift. You and your allies run around the map, placing traps in the various parts of your map, battling the invaders, and performing a host of other actions.&#10;&#10;You earn trophy skulls for killing your enemies, and these act as the game&rsquo;s &ldquo;cash&rdquo; &ndash; spend them to buy new weapons, magic amulets, and a host of other items. You also can spend skulls to place traps, and to upgrade your Guardian, making him better-able to hold off the orcs, gnolls, and other enemies.&#10;&#10;But over time your enemies accrue in strength, too! You have to face three Onslaughts, and with each Onslaught, your foes increase in might. If you do not lay a solid groundwork for your defenses with upgrades and trap placements in the early part of the game, you may face doom later on!&#10;&#10;Combat is straightforward and fast &ndash; you roll various colored dice depending on what type of weapons and upgrades you own. Remove &ldquo;killed&rdquo; enemies from the map, only to see them replaced by new waves each turn. The fun continues. The game builds up over time to a crescendo of doom, in which the last few turns see you frantically try to finish off the final waves of the onslaught before your crippled Guardian is destroyed!&#10;&#10;Head-to-head play?&#10;If you or your friends own both the Order and Unchained versions of Orcs Must Die: The Boardgame , you can go head-to-head, pitting the regimented Order against the legions of the Unchained in an epic conflict. You and your friends will split into two teams &ndash; one side fights for the Order, and the other will control the Unchained.&#10;&#10;Each side has its own heroes, its own armies, its own Items, and its own traps. Your hero can defend your own citadel, or seek to lead your armies to victory inside the enemy lair. With friends to help, your faction can station heroes at both tasks, and even switch off duties. The game supports up to 4 players per side.&#10;&#10;",

Each player in turn presses the &quot;electronic die&quot; which generates a random number from 1 to 6 to move two markers representing the dogs simultaneously along a track, trying to reach the end and be save their offspring.  Along the way, they may land on black paw prints or white paw prints, which move them back or forward six spaces respectively.  Other spaces may also move them forward or backward or cause loss or gain of turns.  If a player lands on another marker, they move back five spaces.  A small element of strategy is added by the ability to move either marker, offering the choice to move the marker that will land on an advantageous space or avoid a negative space.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In the future, sooner than you&rsquo;d bet on&hellip;&#10;&#10;As the world progressed towards the future, the wealthy elite one-percenters found themselves losing their passions.  Golf&rsquo;s formerly exclusive clubs were opened to the masses, horse racing was banned as cruel, and auto racing was found to be not &quot;carbon credit cost effective&quot;.  The elite needed a new pastime.&#10;&#10;Fortunately for them, a new class of mass-spectacle gladiators was found. Questionable lab projects involving human-cloning, attempting to solve the world&rsquo;s worst diseases, created a global zombie pandemic.  Luckily, the crisis was put down quickly &ndash; but the lab-created undead still existed.&#10;&#10;Someone with a bit of redneck, and way too much time, picked up a few up zombie &ldquo;assets&rdquo; at a company bankruptcy liquidation. After a little tinkering, he managed to build a control collar contraption. When a zombie was outfitted with a collar, a skillful operator could, sort-of, get the zombies to walk in a straight line.  Conveniently, the undead had no legal rights, which made them the perfect attraction.&#10;&#10;A viral video and a crowd-sourced funding campaign later, these not-so-intelligent shamblers were being billed as the latest thing in racing spectacles.  Wealthy backers quickly formed teams, a league and championship cup was created, and the wealthy few who could afford the labs, zombie jockeys, and all that related to it now had a new prestigious exclusive club.&#10;&#10;As with all good clubs, betting became part of the social fun.  As one could never really count on one&rsquo;s zombie to come through, betting for, or even against one&rsquo;s own entry into the race was not only allowed, it was encouraged!&#10;&#10;While these new zombie drivers competed against each other for the series championship, the owners had their own prestige cup based on bets, side bets, crowd ratings and worse.&#10;&#10;Bet on your friends zombie driver to make the podium &hellip; SURE!   Bet on your zombie to place third &hellip; WHY NOT? WIN when your zombie shambles over the line backwards &hellip; CHECK!&#10;&#10;Welcome to the wacky, zany, risky but always crazy world of high stakes championship zombie racing!&#10;&#10;In Twenty Yard Shamble, players are owners of racing zombies. They pit their zombie against the other zombies, in a series of 3 races, out of an arena where armed Hunters and helpless Victims prowl. Zombies move in a semi-controlled fashion based on dice rolls. The arena has 6 finish lines spaced equally around the outside edge. The first zombie to cross a finish line is first, and earns points for it's owner AND anyone who bet on it. The second zombie to cross gets second, and the third zombie gets third. After the third zombie crossed a line, the crowd gets bored, and all remaining zombies are shot and killed.&#10;&#10;During a race, players place bets on any of the racing zombies, including their own. If a players zombie is not performing well, that player can place a bet on another player's zombie who is performing better, and may be able to help that zombie finish better in the race.&#10;&#10;At the end of 3 races, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

As the church gathers more converts, they grow stronger with each passing day...&#10;&#10;Druids is a press-your-luck style dice game with a twist where, with the help of the gods, you play as a priest of the ancient Celts, desperately trying to stop the Christians from converting your believers. The twist is that the other players are rolling against you! If they can convert your believers, the victory will be theirs instead. Use the special abilities of the gods to keep the missionaries at bay and keep your faithful strong.&#10;&#10;",

Players choose to play as either Ariel and Flounder or Triton and Sebastian, and press the &quot;electronic die&quot; to move along separate tracks which merge at the end.  As they progress, they may land on spaces that move them forward or backward or cause loss or gain of turns.  Some spaces are also marked with objects to collect (designated by taking a marker).  The player who finishes with the most objects collected wins.&#10;&#10;",

The main game is called &quot;Elliot Moose Counting Board Game.&quot; In this game, players roll a die to move their pieces around a track around the outside edge of the board. When they land on a space, they take the tile depicting a number or objects. They must then choose a face-down tile from the middle with a number printed on it. If the number matches, they keep the pair. If it does not match, both tiles are returned to their places and the next player takes a turn. When all pairs are claimed, the game ends and the player with the most pairs wins. Players can also choose to play &quot;Counting Memory,&quot; which plays similarly but with the die and track removed. Players simply choose a tile from a stack and try to pick the face-down number tile that matches the number of items depicted on the card. Another option is &quot;Guess Which Number!&quot; where one number tile is hidden, the other are placed face-down and players take turns guessing which number is missing.&#10;&#10;",

Once a player completes a row or column and claims bingo, the caller checks the math to make sure their answers are correct. If so, they are declared the winner.

Players cannot bang on their first turn.&#10;&#10;When a player believes their hand is better than at least one other players hand, they bang on the table (or say bang) during their turn instead of drawing and discarding.&#10;&#10;All other players get to draw and discard one more time.&#10;&#10;At the end of the round, players show and announce their hand value (only adding cards of the same color OR the same number, not both).&#10; The player(s) with the worst hand lose one life. &#10;When a player loses all three lives, they are eliminated from the game. The last person with a life wins.&#10;&#10;If a player at any time during the game has three blank cards in their hand, they throw down their cards and yell &quot;I'm Shootin&rsquo; Blanks!&quot; The round ends and all other players lose one life. Blanks are worth 0.&#10;&#10;If a High/Low card is ever face up in the discard pile prior to a player banging, the scoring for the round changes from high to low. You still calculate your high hand, but instead the player with the highest hand value loses a life (ties work the same way for low hand rounds). It is possible to switch from High to Low back to High back to Low in a single round. High/Low cards are worth 0 and can never be drawn from the discard pile.&#10;&#10;Wild cards can be any color and any number 1 through 8. They cannot be Blanks or High/Low cards.&#10;&#10;",

Each player chooses a path, made up of a number of spaces marked with pictures, leading to the doghouse. Each player takes turns spinning a spinner marked with 0 to 3. The player then draws that number of cards from a stack of cards marked with words or pictures. The opposite side of the card shows the first letter of the picture or words. The player must then say the name of the pictured item or read the words (an adult facilitator may help with reading) and the say the letter. The player then looks at his or her path and places a marker on any picture that starts with that letter. If no matches can be found, the card is placed at the bottom of the pile. The first player to place marker on every space on his or her path brings Sound Hound home and wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Players mount knights, activate assassins, and order their Radiant to spread their dominion.&#10;&#10;At its core, Radiant is an area-control trick-taking game in which the winning suit, or race, is determined by a battle's location on a game board. The Radiant race is capable of competing in every region. At the beginning of each round, or age, players are dealt a hand of 8 to 10 cards, and then draft four additional cards which represent the units in their army. After melding card sets, players move a pawn on the game board to determine a battle's location. Players win battles to claim control over regions and for the right to choose the next battle's location.&#10;&#10;Valuable temples and useful portals add excitement to the board. At the end of each age, the board is replenished with victory points waiting to be claimed, creating an asymmetrical board for the second and third ages.&#10;&#10;Prove your power in the ages of the Radiant&#10;&#10;",

On a yellow (or orange) lily pad, the player must choose a question card and answer a fishing trivia question at their level.  A decoder (transparent red plastic) is used to reveal the answer.  If the answer is correct, the player rolls and moves again.  If the card depicts a fish, the player keeps it and has now made a catch.  If the card says so, the player may take the GPS card (of which there is only one), which may allow him or her to take a shortcut along the path.  Purple cards may move the player to &quot;Shore Lunch Island&quot; or other locations, possibly delaying him or her.  The first player to move completely around the track and reach a &quot;Home&quot; space with at least one caught fish wins the game.  However, if a player finished without a fish, he or she may move immediately to &quot;Last Chance Launch&quot; and move toward the home space from there, attempting to catch a fish along the way.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Strange Conversations is a humorous social game for 3 to 7 players that tests players' abilities to convey hints about their secret identities to one another throughout the course of a simple role-played sit-down conversation.&#10;&#10;In each game players find themselves in an interesting hypothetical setting and scenario having a conversation with a group of people with strange and often funny personality quirks.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, each player is assigned a secret JOB and a secret character QUIRK.   For example, a player may be an olympic athlete (job) whose hands keep getting stuck to the table (quirk).   Or, a doctor (job) who offers other players back-handed compliments (quirk).  Or, a dancing instructor (job) who is hitting on other players (quirk).&#10;&#10;With inspiration from a random scenario, players role-play a discussion and provide clues to each other about what their two qualities (job/quirk) are.&#10;&#10;There are no &quot;turns&quot; in this game.  Conversations are free-flowing discussions where players may ask and answer questions whenever appropriate.  Players drop creative hints about their identities through the use of verbal hints, including puns and keywords related to their jobs, hints to aspects of their jobs, and cultural references.  Players may also use physical gestures to help convey their identities.&#10;&#10;Players earn the most points if they can signal what their jobs and quirks are to some -- but not all -- other players, and also earn points for guessing who other players are.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "A precursor of Pergame, Singidunum has been conceived as a game to bridge the gap between traditional wargames and abstract games. It mainly relies on the use of only four types of units and simple movement and attack rules. The main principle is that a ready unit can make only one move or/and attack during a turn of the game. This will allow and even entice players to cleverly coordinate their moves and anticipate their opponent&rsquo;s actions. &#10;The game still retains some of the wargame appeal by using dice to simulate fortunes of war and giving the players a chance to immerse themselves into the brutal fighting between Huns and Romans on the Balkan Peninsula.&#10;&#10;The game is designed to appeal to wargamers looking for a fast game as well as abstract gamers. It is also quite welcoming to the younger players (and their parents) as it offers a fun and easy gateway to wargaming.&#10;The small box dimensions (171x151x36mm) make it perfect for gaming on the go.&#10;&#10;",

Each time you play, the game is quite different with custom characters, a lot of strategy, and a dash of luck.&#10; Imbroglio is a game for 2-7 players and has multiple styles of play, from player vs player to players vs board.  An average game can be played in 45-60 minutes, but with possible expansions in the future, games could be expanded to almost any length.  The basic mechanics of the game are a mix of tile laying, resource management, and dice rolling.  &#10; Our original thought would be that the game would be targeted toward families or gamers who like mythology, strategy, and 'sticking it' to other players.  That being said, the game is quite modular and could accommodate many different game genres!&#10;&#10;",

Everyone speculated, and many become millionaires overnight.&#10;&#10;In Mogul &mdash; a revised and expanded version of the 2002 game of the same name &mdash; players buy and sell railway stock, trying to outsmart both the opponents and the market. Each of the five railroad companies has five to eight shares, and in addition to being a share of the company, each share card has a box on it that indicates another company. Players start with particular stock holdings based on the number of players in the game and their position in turn order.&#10;&#10;Each turn, one stock card is revealed from the deck. Players earn $1 for each share of this color that they own, then an auction ensues. Turn by turn, players must drop one of their bidding chips into a bowl in order to stay in the auction. When a player passes, whether by necessity or choice, they take all of the chips from the bowl, thereby earning bidding power for future auctions.&#10;&#10;When all but one player has passed, this last player wins the auction and has the right to either keep the share or sell stock matching the color of the company depicted on the bottom of the share; the player who dropped out of the auction last takes the action that the winner didn't take. If a player sells stock, they either sell all shares of this color that they own, earning as much for each share as the number of those stock cards face up on the table or they sell none of them; in the latter case, the player places a station depot in their color on an empty space of the appropriate color on the game board. This game board has multiple networks in the five colors of the game, and at game's end each depot has a dollar value equal to the number of that player's depots in the same network.&#10;&#10;When the crash card is revealed from the deck, the game ends. Players earn $1 for each share still in front of them and each five bidding chips they hold, in addition to the value of their depots. Whoever has the most money wins!&#10;&#10;",

Mechanically, draw and place a few hexagonal sector tiles and then deal and draft three event cards per player.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Conquer: plant a civilization in a sector, in control over anyone who's already there.  Mechanically, play a card and place a matching disk on a tile.  Cards have special powers that trigger (most often) during this action.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Reap: harvest the power of the civilizations you've cultivated, then decide whether they live or die.  Mechanically, simultaneously sell a card with the other players.  Its value is based on the value of sectors the matching civilization controls.  Then do a simultaneous bid to determine how many disks survive the reaping.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

As the game only uses dice, there is no need to measure yards or mark a line of scrimmage. Think of the game as a highlights package of your team on the offense drive. They either score or your opponent takes over on offense.&#10;&#10;The Quarterback die will be the central die. Rolling this will choose the play 'called' by the QB. The subsequent die rolled next will be one of the other passing/running positions.&#10;&#10;The WR , TE , &amp; RB all have different plays on each die face with an 'intensity' value that the DEFENSE must match to prevent the play being successful. There are Field Goal options, Flags for penalties, Sacks, Intercepts, Fumbles and an Audible Play option (for PRO MODE)&#10;&#10;The game includes 5 team cards to be used for an optional PRO MODE.&#10;&#10;Light, compact and portable.&#10;&#10;",

Each die has the five elements on a different face, with an arrow pointing to the next element in the cycle. During the game, the dice will be rotated, following the arrows, through the cycle of elements.&#10;&#10;Use your dice to obtain cards, which in turn help you build clever combos to manipulate your dice even more. Align your dice and cards to get essence tokens. Whoever can collect essence of all Five Elements wins.&#10;&#10;",

You can lead with Caesar of Rome and its powerful Legions, or with Pericles, the prominent Greek statesman and orator, with the great Babylonian lawgiver and healer King Hammurabi, or with Queen Cleopatra of Egypt, whose engineers led in the development of grain storage and irrigation, or with Hannibal, leader of the Carthaginians, whose merchants thrived on trade and commerce.

        "description": "In the year 2050 the United Nations made a startling discovery that changed the course of the future.  They learned of the existence of a global terrorist organization known only as VENOM.  This group was  responsible not only for every act of terror in the past two decades, but they were also the ones who brought about the start of World War III.&#10;&#10;Their only goal is that of world domination, and armed with this knowledge the UN enacted Project Freedom.  Their chosen general, Abraham Steele, would be in charge of recruiting an elite task force whose only goal would be to stop VENOM once and for all.&#10;&#10;Venom Assault is a Cooperative Deck Building game with Dice based combat for 1-5 players.  Players will use their turns to recruit new Freedom Squadron Soldiers and Vehicles into their hands that they will use to challenge one of the seven VENOM leaders on the board.  Each card will have set abilities that can help bring about victory, but VENOM can also call upon their own troops to help them out as well.&#10;&#10;Each game will be played using one of ten missions in the base game, which will tell players what goals they need to accomplish to win the game. However VENOM is not going to be idle and if the players are not careful and quick, they may find they have lost to their devious foes while they weren't looking.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "During the American Revolution, no officer on the rebel side was a better field commander than Major General Benedict Arnold. This has been overlooked for well over two centuries; nothing is taught about Arnold except his treason. The fact is: if not for him, the rebellion would probably have failed and its principal players hanged. If he had died at Saratoga instead of being seriously wounded, his legacy would have been nothing short of legendary. Cities, counties and perhaps even a state would be named after him. Statues of Arnold would be standing in parks nationwide and his monument would be visited by throngs of people in the District of Columbia every day.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, Arnold had enemies as well as supporters, and those enemies contributed significantly to his conclusion that the colonies were not yet ready for independence. In Benedict Arnold Poker, a breezy combination of poker and rummy, you will meet some of the men in each group, and Arnold himself.&#10;&#10;[Note: this game is an unfinished, although playable prototype. - ASF]&#10;&#10;",

(But the rat card is not an ingredient.) She reveals the fourth mushroom card and places it on the second deck. She reveals the fifth cheese card, places it on the first deck, and stops revealing the cards.&#10;3. If all decks are made, each player chooses one of the tools cards (tongs card or teas card) and places it face down in front of him/her. If there is only one tools card left for each player, take all the used cards to their hands.&#10;4. Reveal the tools cards at once. The player who played the teas card cannot take any ingredient deck. For all players who played the tongs card, take one of the ingredient decks in clockwise order starting from the next player of the first player, till there is no ingredient deck left.&#10;If all players played the teas card, all ingredient decks are placed on the first player&rsquo;s wastebasket.&#10;Place the used tools cards into a deck, keeping them secret to other players.&#10;2. The first player arranges the cards on the table one by one, according to the number of players. Then, place the    game rest of the cards on those to make new decks. The rat card is not considered as ingredient, but should be placed on one of the new decks.&#10;Example for 2-player game&#10;Alice reveals the first lettuce card and places it on the first new deck. She reveals the&#10;5. For players who took the ingredient deck, stack the ingredient cards to make a hamburger.&#10;5-1. If a rat card is included in the ingredient deck, take the rat tokens as the number of rat cards, and place the&#10;second onion card and places it on the second new deck. She reveals the third rat card and&#10;After placing the cards, Alice plays a tongs card. Other two players play a teas card. Alice&#10;takes all the ingredient decks on the table.&#10;Example for 3-player&#10;rat cards under the wastebasket card. The rat tokens should not be revealed.&#10;5-2. To stack the ingredients, the bottom bun should be placed first. If there is no bottom bun card, flip one of the ingredient cards to use. (Since the rat card is discarded, it cannot be flipped into the bottom bun.)&#10;5-3. To make the complete hamburger, it should contain both bottom and top bun, with ingredients according to the recipe. The top bun must be placed after all other ingredients are placed.&#10;5-4. Hamburgers can only be made according to the recipe. The ingredients may be stacked regardless of the order.&#10;5-5. Place the unused ingredient cards under the wastebasket card and keep them hidden.&#10;6. The game ends if there are 8 or more complete hamburgers in 2- or 3-player game, 9 hamburgers in 4-player&#10;game, and 10 hamburgers in 5-player game. Also, the game ends if there are no cards enough left in the draw deck to make new ingredient decks. If any of the conditions are not satisfied, the player who takes the last ingredient deck becomes the first player. Go back to No.1 and continue the game.&#10;7. After the game ends, you may flip the wastebasket card to use as the last top bun.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The Sun is dying&#10;&#10;In recent years, the Sun has become increasingly unstable, to the point where experts claim it could go supernova at any moment. The various inhabitants of the planets in this solar system are launching one last effort to save themselves, which involves building a final Ark to propel a small selection of their people into deep space. This requires a great deal of energy, and in a final ironic twist, the only source of such great energy is the dying star itself. In the process of extracting and transmitting the energy required to save themselves, they will be compounding the instability of the Sun and hastening the end of their worlds.&#10;&#10;Sol: Last Days of a Star is a board game for one to five players where each player represents a different planetary effort to transmit as much energy from the Sun back to their Ark so they can to escape the solar system before the Sun explodes!&#10;&#10;The board represents the solar environment: two layers of orbit around the Sun (Upper and Lower Orbit), and three layers within the Sun itself (the Convective, Radiative, and Core). The deeper you take actions, the higher your rewards, but the faster the instability of the Sun is increased. Your Mothership rotates slowly in orbit around the Sun, and this is the only place your ships can launch from to perform useful tasks in the solar environment. You can either convert ships into stations or use the ships to activate yours and other players' stations. If you activate your own stations you get the full reward, while activating other player's stations you split the reward with the owner. You gain energy by activating Energy Nodes, and you use this energy to either activate Ship Foundries to build new ships (which you need since you are constantly losing ships by converting them into new stations) or activate Transmit Towers to transmit the energy back to your Ark to turn into Momentum (which is ultimately how your Ark will escape). But you cannot enter the Sun without converting ships into Solar Gates which span the high energy membranes separating one layer of the sun from the next.&#10;&#10;You must carefully manage your time and resources in order to transmit the most energy back to your Ark before the Sun is lost forever. With any luck, some small collection of your last planetary residents will escape the solar system before it is engulfed by the oncoming supernova!&#10;&#10;",

The only currency players have is the cards in their hand (the same cards that represent the Realms for auction), but each of those cards also contains a scoring condition at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;How will you use your cards? Will you bid them often and try to control as many realms as possible? Or will you pick your spots and focus on scoring in specific ways?&#10;&#10;Players are pressured keep cards in hard for scoring and later bids, but they have to bid successfully to claim the Realms needed to make the scoring cards as effective as possible - all while setting traps and avoiding the traps of the other Gods.&#10;&#10;Realms plays in about 10 minutes per player, and will be available in print-and-play soon.

Players collect neighbors that are coming to the BBQ and place them in a line to form the most awesome picture. &#10;Every round players choose a neighbor, the player that chooses the quickest goes first and:  &#10;-places his neighbor in a picture.&#10;-uses that neighbors ability.&#10;-selects a new neighbor to take into their hand.&#10;When any player has 10 or more neighbors in his picture the game ends. The player who has the most awesome looking picture (points) wins.&#10;&#10;The different cards are what makes this game interesting. Some neighbors look better than others, meaning they are worth more look-at-my-awesome-life (lamal) points. Other neighbors are faster or have better abilities. For instance, some let you take neighbors from another players hand or let you switch around neighbors who are waiting to have their picture taken. &#10;This is useful as many neighbors only look good in the right spot.  That hillbilly standing next to the BBQ with a jerrycan could make for an awesome picture, but not when a policeman or concerned mother is standing next to him...&#10;&#10;Other playmodes introduce the option for fast neighbors to pick up stuff(cards), which can help your strategy in different ways and 'you'(cards), which reward you for having neighbors of a certain color. With these you get a game where there is no right play, only a right play for the situation!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "TROLL, published by Oink Games in 2015, is a revised version of Dragon Teeth Washer, originally published by Drosselmeyer in 2012. In TROLL, each player takes the role of a thief, trying to steal precious jewels from the hideous troll.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, each player receives a set of six tokens, with numbers from 0 to 5. Depending the number of the players, some troll cards are not used (Troll cards have values 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15). On a round, players attempt to steal from the target troll by playing his or her tokens in sequence. The first player secretly looks at the target troll (the top troll card) and plays one of his number tokens face up. If he or she plays a &quot;3&quot; token, it means that the player intends to steal 3 jewels from the target troll. Next players have two options: 1) look at the troll card just as the first player did and play a number token face up; or 2) play a number token face down, take a multiplier (x2) token from the pool, and put the multiplier token on his or her face down number token.&#10;&#10;After all the players played their number tokens, the troll card is revealed. Beginning from the player who played the lowest card, add up the value of the number tokens. Suppose that the troll is &quot;9&quot; and Amy played &quot;3&quot;, Becky &quot;5&quot;, Carlos &quot;2&quot;, and Dave &quot;3&quot; with &quot;x2&quot; multiplier on it, Carlos (2), Amy (3), and Dave (3) are entitled to receive 2, 3, and 6 (3x2) jewels respectively. However, Becky will receive a penalty point (-2), since she woke up the troll. 9 is bigger than 2+3+3 but it is smaller than 2+3+3+5. Becky triggered the troll's rampage.&#10;&#10;Play continues in this manner for a specified number of rounds/days (set of rounds), depending the number of the players. The player with the most jewels at the game end is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Mr. Game! is a family-friendly party board game where one player has the power to create permanent rules during the game.&#10;&#10;MECHANICS: Players use a simple roll-and-move system to navigate the board - roll two four-sided dice, choose one of the options, and move. If you land on a space with an ! on it, you draw a card from the game's singular tall stack of chaotic cards. The ultimate goal of the game is to land on the goal, but the goal can change places during the middle of the game if a special GOAL SWITCH Action card is drawn.&#10;&#10;CARDS: There are three kinds of cards in Mr. Game! - Actions, Powerups, and Badges. If you draw an Action, you must play it immediately and discard it. If you draw a Powerup, you must play it immediately, but it stays in play and affects your character's natural abilities (sometimes positively, sometimes negatively). If you draw a Badge, you may play it whenever you want, and you are allowed to keep it concealed.&#10;&#10;TILES: Many cards will bring Tiles into play. These small chipboard squares are essentially movable spaces that can be placed anywhere on the board. They change the layout of the board as soon as the enter play, adding spaces, removing spaces, or transfiguring spaces to have ridiculous, game-altering effects! They can be as simple as another ! space, or they can be as crazy as a Portal that transports you across the board!&#10;&#10;MR. GAME: Before the game begins, someone must volunteer to be Mr. Game. (They can change their title, but the default is Mr. Game) Players must direct all questions to Mr. Game. This character is in charge of adding permanent rules to the game if the need arises. The game is purposely designed so that the core rules allow you to play but leave out specific details. Mr. Game's job is to fill in these details as the game goes on. The more creative Mr. Game is, the more fun everyone has! Other players at the table are encouraged to suggest ideas, but Mr. Game has the final say. If you don't like how they are &quot;Mr. Game-ing&quot;, or they break one of the core tenets of being Mr. Game, just impeach them!&#10;&#10;Mr. Game! is designed to be simple to learn. If you just read this entire description, you already know how to play! Oh, and if you have a question... well, ask Mr. Game!&#10;&#10;",

Draw the first card and put it face up between the players.

These two phases (drawing and placing) are mandatory.&#10;&#10;Below the type of the cards:&#10;&#10;    Padlock : cannot be rotated, even by a joker card&#10;    Rotation : identified by their arrows. Allow the player to rotate one adjacent card by a quarter turn in the arrow direction&#10;    Joker : purple cards. They bear both colors. When placed, they allow the player to rotate any card by a quarter turn.

The pawn is always hidden inside a 3D slot machine. Each time he moves the pawn, he leaves one hidden gold coin below the visited slot machine.&#10;On the family's turn, players cooperate choosing which family pawns to activate. &#10;Family pawns stay among the 3D slot machines, on the intersections of the grid.&#10; When activated, a family pawn may move one space OR search in a bar in the surroundings. &#10;If searching, players can look below the chosen slot machine:&#10;&#10;    if they find the Gambler pawn, they win&#10;    if they find a Gold coin, they remove the 3D slot machine from the gameboard (several gold coins may indicate the current position of the gambler)&#10;    if they find nothing, they must put back the slot.&#10;&#10;&#10;The gambler wins if he runs out of gold coins without being found.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The First Jihad simulates the rise of the Umayyad Caliphate between 632 and 750 AD. The game's AI plays the forces of the Muslim Caliphate, based in Mecca (the game's center position); the player plays a host of nations invaded by the Caliphate (Byzantium, Persia, Visigothic Spain, Nubians, Khazars, Armenians, the Chinese, Indian states, etc.) The game has about 77 counters, one 11x17&quot; map, 50 event cards, and numerous player aids and historical background materials.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Periodyx is a card game based on the Periodic Table of Elements. The game can be played by 2-10 players. Each player is dealt 5 cards, the winner of the game is either: The first player to hold 10 cards, or if one player loses all their cards the player who, at that point, holds the most cards. Cards are gained or lost among players or from a central pile. A Game indicator card with the titles of 11 games is passed around the players the holder of this card being the &quot;lead player&quot; in each of the 11 rounds thus making each round of play random, and different. The prime purpose of the game is to become familiar with the elements, players with more familiarity will stand a higher chance of winning.&#10;&#10;The rounds listed on the Periodyx Game Indicator Card are:&#10;&#10;1) Atomic Power!&#10;The lead player asks ONE OTHER player to choose a card in their hand and to read out loud that element&rsquo;s name (do not show the card). The lead player then chooses a card from their own hand, and reads out loud the element&rsquo;s name. Both cards are now compared. The player whose card has the HIGHER Atomic Number wins, takes both cards, and adds them to the cards in their hand. This ends this lead player&rsquo;s turn and play moves on to the next player.&#10;&#10;2) A-2-Z!&#10;The new lead player picks any letter of the alphabet and then asks ONE player of their choice if they have an element beginning with the letter they have named. If the asked player DOES have an element that begins with the letter the lead player asked for, they must give the lead player the card (or cards if they have more than one that begins with the asked for letter). This ends the lead player&rsquo;s turn, and play moves on to the next player. &#10;If the asked player DOES NOT have an element that begins with the letter, the lead player asked for, the ASKED player takes the top card from the &ldquo;draw pile&rdquo; and adds it to the cards in their hand. &#10;This ends this lead player&rsquo;s turn, and play moves on to the next player.&#10;&#10;3) Hot Stuff!&#10;The new lead player asks ONE OTHER player to choose a card in their hand and to read out loud that element&rsquo;s name (do not show the card). The lead player then chooses a card from their own hand, and reads out loud the element&rsquo;s name. Both cards are now compared. The player whose card has the HIGHER boiling point wins, takes both cards, and adds them to the cards in their hand. &#10;This ends this lead player&rsquo;s turn, and play moves on to the next player.&#10;&#10;4) Hi-Lo!&#10;The new lead player takes any one card from their hand, and places it face up in front of them. From this card the lead player chooses ANY ONE of the stats from in the Stat Section (except the date stat) and predicts whether the next card turned over from the &ldquo;draw pile&rdquo; will have a higher or a lower number in the same stat. Once the prediction is made, the top card from the &ldquo;draw pile&rdquo; is turned over and the two cards are compared. &#10;If the lead player has predicted correctly, they take both cards, and adds them to the cards in their hand. If the lead player has predicted incorrectly, both cards are given to the player on their left. &#10;This ends this lead player&rsquo;s turn, and play moves on to the next player.&#10;&#10;5) Neutron Countdown!&#10;The lead player asks ONE OTHER player to choose a card in their hand, and to read out loud the name of the element (do not show the card). The lead player then chooses a card from their own hand, and reads out loud that element&rsquo;s name. Both cards are now compared. The player whose card has the HIGHER number of neutrons wins, takes both cards, and adds them to the cards in their hand. &#10;This ends this player&rsquo;s turn, and play moves on to the next player.&#10;&#10;6) Add-it!&#10;The lead player takes the top card from the &ldquo;draw pile,&rdquo; and adds it to the cards in their hand. This ends this lead player&rsquo;s turn, and play moves on to the next player.&#10;&#10;7) Big Freeze!&#10;The new lead player asks ONE OTHER player to choose a card in their hand, and to read out loud that element&rsquo;s name (do not show the card). The lead player then chooses a card from their own hand, and reads out loud the element&rsquo;s name. Both cards are now compared. The player whose card has the LOWER melting point wins, takes both cards, and adds them to the cards in their hand. This ends this lead player&rsquo;s turn, and play moves on to the next player.&#10;&#10;8) Element of Surprise!&#10;The lead player asks ONE OTHER player to hold out their cards fanned-out, facedown. The lead player then takes ANY ONE card from the asked player, and adds it to the cards in their hand. This ends this lead player&rsquo;s turn, and play moves on to the next player. &#10;&#10;    SPECIAL NOTE: The lead player cannot take the LAST card from any player.&#10;&#10;&#10;9) Early Bird!&#10;The lead player takes ANY card from their hand, and places it face up in front of them. They then predict whether the next card turned over from the &ldquo;draw pile&rdquo; will have an earlier or later date of discovery than their card. Once the prediction is made, the top card from the &ldquo;draw pile&rdquo; is turned over, and compared. If the lead player has predicted correctly, they take both cards and add them to the cards in their hand. If the lead player has predicted incorrectly, both cards are given to the player on their left. This ends this lead player&rsquo;s turn, and play moves on to the next player.&#10;&#10;10) Match!&#10;The lead player takes ANY card from their hand, and places it face up in front of them. They then ask ONE OTHER player to do the same. &#10;Now ALL of the players play at the same time and try to be the first player to spot how the two cards match, or are the same in any way. Are they both metals? Both solids? Do both element names begin with the letter &lsquo;P&rsquo;, any similarity can be a correct match. The first player to spot the match keeps both the matched cards. This ends this lead player&rsquo;s turn, and play moves on to the next player.&#10;&#10;11) Natural/Synthetic/Atomic&#10;The lead player takes ANY card from their hand, and places it facedown in front of them. They then ask ONE OTHER player to do the same. Both cards are turned over, face up at the same time. Check the Natural/Synthetic/Atomic symbols at the bottom of the cards: &#10;&bull;    Natural beats synthetic/atomic, &#10;&bull;    Natural/atomic beats natural &#10;&bull;    Synthetic/atomic beats natural/atomic. &#10;The winner takes both cards, and adds them to the cards in their hand. If it is a tie, both players keep their own cards. This ends this lead player&rsquo;s turn, and play moves on to the next player.&#10;&#10;The Mendeleev Card&#10;If on a player&rsquo;s turn (before taking their turn), they can place a card next to the Mendeleev Card so that the colored bars match (see example) they may play that card on the table and draw 2 cards from the &ldquo;draw pile.&rdquo; If there are 2 or more cards in play on the table (this begins to form the periodic table). Any cards that match any of the cards can be played in this manner, drawing two fresh cards for each card played.&#10;Winning!&#10;&#10;Two ways to end the game:&#10;&#10;1) The first player to collect TEN cards in their hand immediately stops and wins the game!&#10;&#10;2) The first player to lose ALL the cards in their hand stops the game. The player who, when the game is stopped, has the highest number of cards in their hand is declared the winner. In the case of a tie, the player who has the card with the highest Atomic Number wins.&#10;Ties or N/A!&#10;If during any round of play the stats are tied, the round is void, this ends the lead player&rsquo;s turn, and play moves on to the next player, and the next game on the Periodyx Game Indicator Card.&#10;&#10;If there is a N/A (not applicable) on a card, this round is void. Players have the option to keep a card with a N/A or to exchange it by returning it to the bottom of the draw pile and taking the top card from the draw pile.&#10;&#10;There is an expansion book available with rules for 10 further games.&#10;&#10;",

However, you also lead the barbarians fighting against the people.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a number of settlements in different sizes; hamlets, villages, towns and cities. The first player to place all of them on the board is the winner.&#10;&#10;The world is made up of tiles of different kinds - foundations for settlements, resources necessary for settlements, and useless wastelands. At the start, the world is terra incognita and all tiles are turned face down, waiting to be explored by the units.&#10;&#10;The units in the world are of two kinds - explorers and barbarians. They do not belong to particular players but any player may act with them. Explorers may explore a tile (move to it and look at it privately) or exploit a tile (turn it face up and make it available for all players). Barbarians on the other hand plunder tiles and turn them face down again.&#10;&#10;By turning tiles face up or face down, players may make more or less resources connected to settlements. This allows the settlement to be expanded or expelled and the player to replace the existing settlement with one from the hand.&#10;&#10;The challenge of the game is to play the common units so that the right settlement can be played in the right place at the right time.&#10;&#10;There are no such things as &rdquo;mine&rdquo; and &rdquo;yours&rdquo;, nor such things as &rdquo;good&rdquo; and &rdquo;evil&rdquo;. All units are commonly played, whether they be explorers or barbarians. To win, you must use the common resources to rise above the commons, not unlike the challenges of a real leader!&#10;&#10;",

Why would you do that? Because initially the highest-valued letter in the game, e.g. C, is determined randomly, with the other cards being ranked lower in C in order: C is higher than D, which is higher than E, etc. with G higher than A. When you play the same chord &mdash; that is, letter &mdash; as another player, you make that chord the new highest-valued letter for subsequent tricks.&#10;&#10;What's more, if you play the same chord as the player who started the trick &mdash; that is, if you improvise &mdash; not only do you change the highest-ranking chord, that trick goes unresolved and you start a new trick with the winner of that trick taking all tricks played since multiple instances of improvisation can take place.&#10;&#10;You score a bonus for improvisation, but you don't want to take too many tricks in a round as that will cost you points in the long run. Score well, lead the band, then step aside for others to (possibly) take things too far. After multiple rounds, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;The 2015 edition of Take The &quot;A&quot; Chord included rules only for three and four players, while the 2021 edition contains larger components and rules for 2-4 players.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary:&#10;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#131;&#163;&#227;&#130;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#131;&#163;&#227;&#130;&#186;&#227;&#131;&#159;&#227;&#131;&#165;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#131;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#146;&#140;&#233;&#159;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#188;&#183;&#229;&#188;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#231;&#171;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130; &#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#188;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#164;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#232;&#187;&#162;&#232;&#170;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#184;&#187;&#229;&#176;&#142;&#230;&#168;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#143;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#233;&#141;&#181;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#142;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

Each player takes on a persona which provides a unique benefit during the game. You begin the game with some basic resources and a small amount of silver. While all structures can earn you prestige, only building what the town's citizens demand will earn you the silver necessary to bid for and purchase more resources. Each turn consists of four phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Bidding (the primary means of gaining resources)&#10;    Building (constructing and occasionally demolishing)&#10;    Income (gaining silver for the structures you own)&#10;    Marketplace (an opportunity to buy plans and resources)&#10;&#10;&#10;The game introduces the citizen track, a growing group of town folk that allows all players to see which structures will earn them income. It also serves to signal the end of the game once the town is full. The town is split into four districts, each limited in size and awarding bonuses at the end of the game for anyone who controls more of a district than their opponents. If there are no other plots on which to build, the game also ends. Beware, while the citizens are known, the best laid plans can be ruined by events and visitors to the town. The player with the greatest prestige at the end of the game is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;",

On your turn, you draw a card, place a piece of junk into play from your hand, and then activate one of the abilities on your junk or use your character's ability.&#10;&#10;All junk is worth something. In the Junkpile, there is one card that is the most coveted of items called The Crown. Once a player draws that card, the game is over and everyone adds up the points displayed on the pieces of junk they have found or hoarded. The player with the most points wins the current round. The game only takes about 15 minutes to play, and is designed for multiple rounds of play.&#10;&#10;",

It's up to the player to buy low, sell high, and try to bankrupt their opponents out of the sky.&#10;&#10;Ventures in the Void is all about risk and reward.  The unique double ended cards mean that each time a player transacts with a planet they increase the opportunities for opponents to reap huge rewards. Will they make their rendezvous in time to cash in, or will an opponent stick them with a customs inspection or labor disruption and delay them right out of their profits?  Every credit matters when the first captain to make 300,000,000 credits wins.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a ship and a fist full of credits.&#10;&#10;Each turn players may play a trade card, move, and play an event card.&#10;&#10;Movement is based on the range of the ship and a player may move along the grid up to that range.&#10;&#10;Trade cards are double ended with a supply and demand for a single planet. When a player transacts with a planet they play the end of the card that they are utilizing facing them and no other player may use it. The other end of the card is now available for all other players to use. Each player may only have two trade cards active in front of them at a time.  New trade cards replace those that are in play, cutting off access to those deals.&#10;&#10;Event cards either hinder opponents or give the active player an advantage. Events are resolved at the end of each players' turn. &#10;Ship upgrades that extend range or cargo space are available for the duration of the game for a tidy sum of credits. Players must decide if the bonus will recoup the investment in time to edge out their opponents.&#10;&#10;The goal is for each trade to double or triple a player's resource investment but with only two of the available trade cards in a player's control each transaction is a gamble.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "This game board is a 4D HYPERCUBE or TESSERACT with four inch sides, projected onto 2D space. On this game board all coordinates are in units and chess pieces (zees) are used as game pieces. The first number in each coordinate is how far from the game board Origin (0000) in the X direction (right/left), the 2nd number is how far from 0000 in the Y direction (diagonally upward); the 3rd is how far in the Z direction (up/down); the 4th how far in the T direction (diagonally downward). Point 4204, for example, is 4 units in the X direction, 2 units in the Y direction, 0 units in the Z direction, and 4 units in the T direction (from 0000). There is every 4 digit combination of 0, 1, and 2 making an 81 coordinate grid (3^4 = 81). Other &ldquo;Noonka Boreds&rdquo; are 4&quot;, 6&rdquo; and 8&rdquo; sided Tesseracts where coordinates are 4 digit combinations of 0,2 &amp; 4, 0, 3 &amp; 6, and 1, 4 &amp; 8 respectively.&#10;&#10;Zees are arranged on the grid of this game board to play variant forms of games such as Checkers, Chess, and Solitaire with up to 8 players; however the board is very versatile in that many games can be played with modifications and enough different styles of zees. Role playing games can be played in 3D space with 3 different time periods. There are enough zees with each basic game board to play 8 player 4D Checkers (or 4 player 4D Chess). JetEyes are caps placed onto the zees to indicate an increased status including moving forward and backwards rather than just forwards around the 4D grid board. A jetEyed Pawn is a King.&#10;&#10;Games can take between 15 minutes and 3 hours depending on the game, number of players, and their experience levels. There are many ways to modify the games so that it takes more or less time, or to accommodate different experience levels. Note: the game has an abstract feel to it that appeals more to the math-geek. The beauty in the board is that it helps you visualize four dimensional space-time. Think of the grid as a 3D cube on a time-line, with 3D cubes at T=0, T=2 (red cube), and T=4. There are also 3D cubes where Y=0, Y=2 (green cube) and Y=4, Z=0, Z=2 (blue cube) and Z=4, and X=0, X=2 (brown, light blue, or yellow cube on website and poster sized boards), and X=4. In fact, because there are midpoints on each of the cubes, there are also 96 smaller 3D cubes on this board. You get so caught up in the geometry and numbers that time passes and you are &ldquo;Never Bored&rdquo; (Noonka is Spanish for &ldquo;Never&rdquo; (misspelled from &ldquo;nunca&rdquo;))!&#10;&#10;",

The saying means, &quot;When a crow cries, I must leave this place. Even if I must kill crows all over the world, I want to stay with you a little while longer.&quot; The song expresses his longing for amorous time to be prolonged for even just a short while.&#10;&#10;In the game Sanzen Sekai: I'd kill all the crows in the world to be with you a little longer, now titled Crows Overkill in its newest edition, players roleplay guests in a red-light district. Many birds gather in front of each player. The players must kill or move birds to prevent them from crying. If birds in front of a player cry, that player must leave the red-light district to go home (i.e. drop out of the game). The player who manages to stay in the red-light district for the longest time wins.&#10;&#10;In more detail, players attempt to be the last one called away from the red-light district by the cry of crows, warblers, and roosters.  The game consists of two decks of cards &mdash; birds and shamisen &mdash; along with a time board. Each turn follows this sequence:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Cards are drawn from both decks. Birds are placed on the table in front of the current player, while shamisen cards go into their hand.&#10;    Shamisen cards are then played to eliminate birds.&#10;    A check is made against the time board to see whether the remaining birds cry and the current player is eliminated.&#10;&#10;&#10;The turns continue until one player remains in the game and is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;",

In this game, characters roll the two dice (a 20-sided and a 12-sided) and consult a chart in the book to try to completely dress their stick figure (drawn on a piece of paper). Underwear and socks must be put on before other pieces of clothing. Each piece of clothing requires a certain combination such as &quot;Underwear--Blue odd, purple even&quot; or &quot;Jacket--Blue die is greater than the purple die.&quot;  Many die rolls will allow more than one piece of clothing to be chosen, but only one piece may be added per turn, so players must choose which piece to add strategically.  The first player to fully dress his or her stick figure wins.&#10;&#10;",

In this bingo-based game, players choose either multiplication or addition and create 5x5 bingo-type cards using lists of numbers included in the book.  Players may choose the numbers on their cards and their positions on the card.  One player then rolls two dice (12 and 20-sided), calls out the sum or product and players mark that number if it appears on their card.  The first player to finish a row of five, vertical, horizontal or diagonal wins.&#10;&#10;The strategy in this game comes from where the players choose to place numbers on their cards.  Since some numbers are more likely to be rolled, players may choose to place those numbers all in one row or column or in the center of the board where they can appear in horizontal, vertical or diagonal rows.&#10;&#10;",

To summon a monster, the summoner need to have matching symbols on their card to summon the monster next to them. Each round ends when players placed four cards on their top, left, right and bottom of their summoner. Players can decide to play SP card as a card below the Help card, an SP card is placed faced down and revealed at the same time, if both players play the same SP card, there will be no effects on the board.&#10;&#10;When a round ends, the board is checked to see if there is a &quot;combo&quot; or a side that has a higher monster power. The winner of the round receives points equal to the number of cards used on both sides, multiplied by a number according to the combo.&#10;&#10;",

Finally, the Cultist chooses to either use a Relic, or remove a Ritual token from Cthulhu (represented by the Moderator).&#10;&#10;If the final Ritual token is removed, the game ends with the Cultist and all the Townsfolk winning, living or dead.

Then each player picks a character that they want to use this round. After everyone has got a character card, an unexpected incident card is revealed. This incident could ruin a player's original plan of his selected character's power. Lastly, players take their turn according to the turn number written on their character cards, and perform 2 of the 3 possible actions: hire worker(s), mine from the map, or sell the commodities.&#10;&#10;The player with most money after 12 rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

It shows how politics in Latin America works.&#10;&#10;Each player controls a cabinet of political lizards, with a dominant political ideology (right wing, left wing or center). Depending on its current ideology, a player will be able to hire certain politicians (ties of colors red, blue, grey) in the main board by auctioning in the different media (Tv, radio, internet and press). This auction will determine order of turn as well as which politicians he can acquire. A player can also auction for tamales that will give the player points and money.&#10;&#10;Players will try to match the symbols in the ties of the lizards with the union cards to acquire them. Unions will give the players money to the lizards of th same ideology and bills that the cabinet must pass by spending coins and politicians.&#10;&#10;Finally, players can send some of their politicians to the president board to do lobby. The player at the end of the game with more tie cards in the president board will gain points by a mayority mechanic.&#10;&#10;In the game, player's will try to acquire Unions by bidding on the media (TV, Radio, Internet, Press), while trying to get &quot;tamales&quot; (a tipical Colombian food) to give to the people and buy votes. The Unions will ask for a set of political ideologies in the player's cabinet, so, the player will have to hire politicians of the proper ideologies to get their support. Finally, a leader can send his politicians to make lobby with the president, to earn more points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Spanish description:&#10;Dise&ntilde;ado por David Laverde como s&aacute;tira a la forma que funciona la pol&iacute;tica, Lagartus Pol&iacute;ticus es un juego inteligente que pone a los jugadores en el papel de lagartos pol&iacute;ticos que intentar&aacute;n armar un gabinete pol&iacute;tico seg&uacute;n conveniencia para poder ganar el respaldo de distintos gremios (transporte, comunicaciones, etc).

Each round ninjas choose a card from their hand and play it face down in front of them. All cards are revealed at once - during which time &ldquo;hi-ya!&rdquo; and other ninja related noises are encouraged but not required.  Cards are played on in order from lowest to highest Strength - the ninja(s) with the highest Strength Attack Card on top of their Combat Pile takes those cards as damage. All other Combat Piles remain in play and can be added to in subsequent rounds.  The game continues until all cards have been played and final damage is resolved.&#10;&#10;The player with the lowest total damage is the Ultimate Ninja Master and may karate chop the losers in the neck (or just bask in the glory of victory until the next game begins).&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Robbers raided Pharaoh Anopheles' grave a long time ago and stole all the valuable scarab beetles. Since then, his mummy has restlessly roamed the pyramid corridors, scaring away anyone who dares intrude. Courageous heroes are the only ones who can free the mummy of the curse. Only those who possess the precious scarabs and can creep through the dark tunnels past the scary mummy all the way to the burial chamber stand a chance of breaking the mummy curse. Whoever hurries through the maze without being careful will attract the furious mummy and quickly find themselves right back at the pyramid entrance. Many adventurers have already tried and failed miserably. Can you get rid of the mummy's curse?&#10;&#10;Pharaoh's Gulo Gulo, a reimplementation of the 2003 game Gulo Gulo, challenges players to make their way through a desert, then through the Pharaoh's pyramid. Before the game begins, players lay out face-down tiles on the desert path, in the pyramid, and in the mummy's burial chamber. The mummy figure starts outside the burial chamber, and the players start at the beginning of the desert.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player first explores the tomb either by flipping over the closet tile that has not yet been revealed, or by choosing the color of a desert or pyramid tile that's been revealed. The player then digs for the color chosen or revealed on the tile in a wooden bowl. This bowl contains twenty &quot;boulders&quot; (wooden spheres) and a thin Pharaoh's staff that's placed standing up in the bowl. If the player successfully removes a boulder of the proper color without the Pharaoh's staff or another boulder falling out of the bowl, that player moves &mdash; either forward or backward &mdash; to the next space on the path of that color. If the player lands on a scarab space, they take a scarab token and place it in front of themself (with a maximum of four scarabs for a player).&#10;&#10;If the player creates a landslide by dropping a boulder or causing the staff to fall and touch the table, that player must retreat to the starting desert space (if in the desert) or the pyramid entrance (if in the pyramid). (You refill the bowl with all the boulders should someone cause a landslide or when all the boulders of one color have been removed.)&#10;&#10;If the player lands on a tile showing one or more mummy heads, the mummy advances that many spaces, moving again if it lands on a tile showing mummy heads. If the mummy passes a player or lands on the same space as one, that player must discard a scarab or retreat immediately to the pyramid entrance. The mummy roams back and forth from burial chamber to entrance, so you'll encounter it at least once!&#10;&#10;A player must have at least two scarabs to enter the burial chamber, after which the player must complete two boulder grabs in a row based on the tiles in that chamber. The first player to do so wins!&#10;&#10;",

In the aftermath of Ruele's Doom, the Empire was shattered, torn apart into nine houses each led by one of the Emperor's former council. The realm was thrown into bitter conflict as each of the nine houses vied for power over the others &ndash; each seeking to reunite the broken Empire under their rule. This conflict became known as the Game of Crowns.&#10;&#10;In Game of Crowns, each player takes control of one of the nine noble houses. During the game, players can exchange cards and favors through diplomatic relations, or directly attack opponents through warfare in order to take what they want. It will take clever planning, skillful negotiation, and daring confrontations to gain dominance over your rivals and seize the crown!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The postcards in every local drug store read, &quot;Welcome to Fabulous Farmingdale!&quot;, an ad campaign that was the brainchild of Mayor Hernandez (who coincidentally employed his wife's public relations firm to market their community). But right now, things are far from fabulous in Farmingdale and, for once, everyone isn't blaming the Mayor. Some kind of virus or poison is turning ordinary people into vicious, zombie-like killers. It is not clear how the disease spreads (though it seems that physical contact is certainly one way), but it is obvious what the illness does to its victims.&#10;&#10;These undead, nicknamed &quot;Zeds&quot; from the local newscasts as the acronym for &quot;Zombie Epidemic Disease,&quot; are now converging on your corner of the world around Farmingdale. As best you can tell, you have been left to your own devices to stop them while the National Guard organizes a relief column, but that could take days, perhaps weeks, for them to fight their way to you and until then, what can you do?&#10;&#10;With little choice between survival and a gruesome (un)death, you realize that you must coordinate the defense of the town of Farmingdale and its surrounding villages. You must lead the good citizens and emerging heroes of these communities to halt the Zeds' advances by (re)killing them, attempt to coordinate the discovery of a cure to this vile scourge, and preserve as much of the area and as many of its inhabitants as possible. There's no time to lose...&#10;&#10;",

You need to travel around the world and visit the casinos of Las Vegas, Atlantic City, Monte Carlo, and Macau. On the way you must answer questions: Correct answers wins you money, but it costs if you can't answer.&#10;&#10;You also have the oppertunity to gamble. You can challenge your opponents in Black Jack to win their money - or loose. You can put money on the dice, the one-armed bandit, or try a fortune cookie, which can bring fortune but most certain also the opposite.&#10;&#10;The winner is the first to visit the four casinos, reach the board's center and correctly answer a crucial question. BUT only if you also have the most money in your pocket.&#10;&#10;In Farrago there are plenty of opportunities to both gloat with your knowledge and tease your opponents, when winning their money from them. You must dare to gamble, challenge your opponents and have the fate on your page. Or you can go completely bust when the playing fever runs away with you.&#10;&#10;",

Fortunately for the Allies, the Dutch had disobeyed orders and posted a strengthened division at the crossroads. Wellington, the Allied commander, swiftly reacted and reinforcements were force-marched to aid the beleaguered Dutch. Ney also ordered reinforcements, but in his case the reinforcements were supposed to be helping Napoleon in his own battle with the Prussians at Ligny. In the end, Wellington's forces drove the French from the field, while Ney never got his reinforcements, which marched back and forth between Quatre Bras and Ligny affecting neither battle.&#10;&#10;In this 2 player wargame, can you do better?&#10;&#10;Each side controls around 10-20 units - these are infantry, cavalry, and artillery. The cavalry are further subdivided into 3 types: Heavy, Light, and Lancers. Each unit has a rating ranging from 2 to 4. When this is reduced below zero through combat hits, the unit is eliminated.&#10;&#10;The scale is around 2000 men or 1000 cavalry per unit. Each game turn is half an hour. The map shows the environs of Quatre Bras, divided into areas. Between Areas are Approaches where infantry may deploy.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player receives a certain number of actions. These are spent manoeuvring the forces, including into combat, and rallying those with hits. Then both sides fire artillery, then the 2nd player does the same, and the turn is over. Quatre Bras has 14 turns in it, and victory is determined by casualties inflicted, and objectives held at the end.&#10;&#10;There are optional rules and possible alternatives, such as the arrival of different French reinforcements.&#10;&#10;",

At the beginning of each round, one player is chosen to be the captain of the trip and he rolls 2-4 dice to discover the challenges that they will face: fog, lightning bolts, killer birds, or pirates. He must then play the appropriate cards &mdash; a compass, a lightning arrester, a foghorn, or even cannons &mdash; to continue on the journey and reach the next city. But before the captain plays the appropriate cards, each player must decide whether to stay within the aircraft:&#10;&#10;&#10;     If you exit, you're guaranteed the victory points that come from exploring the current city.&#10;     If you stay on board, you hope to make it to the next city in order to catch more precious treasures. If the captain can't overcome the challenge, though, everyone comes crashing down empty-handed and you'll need to begin a new trip with all passengers on board.&#10;&#10;&#10;During the journey, each adventurer can try to pull out of the game with fabulous objects (a jetpack, astronomy glasses, etc.) or by changing the trip (modifying the travel or abandoning an explorer in the city). As soon as a player earns treasure worth at least fifty points, the game ends and this player wins.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Note: The cardlist shows a card with the name Nightmare Fuel. The card was renamed Blood Transfusion, but the cardlist was not updated. You have the correct cards, though.&#10;&#10;Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Adventure Time Card Wars is the most epic card game ever found in the Land of Ooo, or anywhere for that matter! In the Adventure Time episode &quot;Card Wars&quot;, Jake begs Finn to play his favorite trading card game. Finn accepts, despite warnings from Beemo on how very competitive Jake can be while playing the game. Finn and Jake battle against each other to decide who will be the Dweeb and who will be the Cool Guy.&#10;&#10;Now fans can play the actual Card Wars game in Adventure Time Card Wars: Ice King vs. Marceline, with all of the action taking place in four combat lanes.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player has two Action Points to spend on Creatures, Spells, and Locations, and cards cost between 0 and 2 Action Points to play. When you summon a Creature, you choose which lane you want to place it in; some Creatures have FLOOP abilities that allow you to use their special abilities. When you attack with a Creature down a lane, you might find an opposing Creature, or you might get to deal your damage straight to your opponent's Hit Points. Reduce your opponent's Hit Points from 25 to 0 and you're the Cool Guy (and you win the game)!&#10;&#10;In Adventure Time Card Wars: Ice King vs. Marceline, which contains all new cards other than a few rainbow card repeats, the Ice King and his IcyLands deck take on Marceline's dark and crafty Useless Swamps &amp; NiceLands deck. IcyLands creatures are all about attacking directly. They would prefer to avoid attacking other creatures. One way they can find some clear lanes to attack down is through frozen tokens. Through various means, these chilling tokens can be placed onto your opponent's Landscapes. Opponents will find playing creatures onto frozen landscapes rather difficult. Where the Ice King finds an opening, he will strike as hard as a blizzard!&#10;&#10;Marceline's deck is a Useless Swamps &amp; NiceLands deck. This is the first time that NiceLands has been paired with another landscape type, and the chemistry is going to burn hot! The Useless Swamp side of the deck is themed around denial, discard, and dirty tricks. Some of the Useless Swamp Creatures are willing victims to your dark tidings. When they go, they leave a lot of destruction in their wake. The NiceLands side of the deck is themed around creatures with exactly five damage on them. This is a tweak to the NiceLands strategy as seen in the original NiceLands deck. There, the creatures thrived with various different amounts of damage on them. Now the trick is to get as many of your creatures as you can to have exactly five damage on them. When that happens, look out!&#10;&#10;Each Card Wars starter set has a pair of different forty-card decks and is ready to play right out of the box. Mix the decks together to come up with your own righteous combos!&#10;&#10;",

To determine who gets which clients, seven comedian tiles (all either male or female) are placed in a row &mdash; one under each letter of the word &quot;CASTING&quot; &mdash; then one letter tile is secretly dealt to each agent to let them know who they represent.&#10;&#10;The Director chooses one of three questions from a card and reads it out loud, e.g., &quot;What is the comedian's favorite dish?&quot;, &quot;What's their hobby?&quot;, or &quot;What is their main quality?&quot; Now the agents must write an answer to this question that will help the director guess who their client is, based only on their looks!&#10;&#10;As the director, you earn points by guessing who each agent represents; as an agent, you score by having the director guess which comedian is yours &mdash; and by betting on how many good guesses the director will have!&#10;&#10;",

While the last carriers, with only a few planes between them, drew off the massive US carrier strike force, a flotilla of Japanese battleships and cruisers descended on the American invasion fleet in Leyte Gulf. As the Japanese ships rounded the island of Samar, they ran into two task forces of US escort carriers.&#10;&#10;Yamato Unleashed picks up the action at this point. The Japanese player must push through the carrier groups and get heavy ships off the edge of the map, where they will find the American transports. The US player must fight for time, using carrier aircraft and light vessels, destroyers and destroyer escorts, to delay the Japanese until a squadron of US battleships arrive to even the odds. Historically the Japanese turned and ran; it might not work out that well this time.&#10;&#10;Each counter represents a single ship, or a fighter, dive bomber, or torpedo squadron, each hex is a nautical mile, and each turn is 12 minutes. Ships are rated for main guns, secondary guns, torpedoes, armor, speed, and maneuverability. Hits can cause general damage, start fires, slow a ship, or cause a catastrophic explosion. Simple mechanics and a quick combat resolution keep the game moving.&#10;&#10;World at War Issue #46, FEB &ndash; MAR 2016&#10;&#10;Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 228 counters&#10;&#10;",

Now, the great factions of the galaxy mobilize their fleets and race to establish a foothold. The reward for successful domination surpasses all other concerns, and the price for conquering this sector will be paid in lives.&#10;&#10;Forbidden Stars challenges you and up to three other players to take command of a mighty fighting force: the Ultramarines chapter of Space Marines, the Eldar of Craftworld Iyanden, the Evil Sunz Ork clan, or the World Eaters Warband of the Chaos Space Marines. Each faction offers unique armies and play styles, but your goal remains the same &mdash; to claim the key objectives selected for your faction. These objective tokens are scattered throughout the Herakon Cluster, but your opponents are sure to defend your objectives against you. You need to build massive armies and command them in unending war to best your enemies and claim your objectives. The fight for the Herakon Cluster is brutal and bloody, and either you will stride triumphant over the bodies of your fallen foes &mdash; or they will do the same to you.&#10;&#10;Each round in Forbidden Stars is divided into three phases. In the planning phase, players take turns placing order tokens face down on the separate tiles (systems) that make up the game board; the four types of order tokens that players can place correspond to four types of actions that players can resolve in the second phase of play. In the operations phase, players reveal their tokens to:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Dominate, draining friendly planets of their important resources&#10;     Strategize, purchasing cards that can upgrade their orders and combat abilities&#10;     Deploy, building cities, factories, bastions, and new mobile units&#10;     Advance, moving units and attacking their enemies.&#10;&#10;&#10;The last phase of each round is the refresh phase, during which players profit from the planets they control, reveal event cards to move the impassable Warp Storms, and heal any units wounded in battle.&#10;&#10;Because of the game's three-phase structure, strategy in Forbidden Stars is balanced between short-term bluffing and long-term tactical military action. The game's set-up also poses strategic opportunities. Players start the game by taking turns assembling sections of the Herakon Cluster, placing individual system tiles along with their own starting forces and the enemy objectives that they must defend. This intentional construction, along with the unique domination abilities of the game's four factions, means that players must work to best utilize their own force's strengths while exploiting the weaknesses of their opponents.&#10;&#10;",

Well, now you can!&#10;&#10;Stetsons &amp; Sixguns is a fast-paced card game played over 8 rounds. Channelling iconic characters from classic Western adventures, 2-8 players compete to become the most notorious gunslinger in town.&#10;&#10;Beginning with 4 Action Cards, you secretly select an Action to play, then draw your gun and point it at your target.  Decide whether to tough it out or dive for cover and reveal your Action Card.  Every Sixgun has Bullet counters loaded into its 6 chambers.  Flip a Bullet to see whether you hit your target.  They may be protected by Cover or the Action they played, but you can counter this with your own Action or a wily Special Ability unique to each character.  Those of you still standing at the end of the round gain a new Action to play.&#10;&#10;Players gain Notoriety for shooting other &lsquo;slingers and holding valuable cards at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Expect lots of bangs and laughter: Stetsons &amp; Sixguns is fast, furious fun that puts the &lsquo;gun&rsquo; back into &lsquo;gunfight&rsquo;.&#10;&#10;",

Your intelligence, agility and resourcefulness will all be tested in this urban close combat environment game.&#10;&#10;You are the commander of a six-man elite combat force team, and you have been sent to an undisclosed &quot;Zone Of Action&quot; in the Middle East to control the evolving threat by insurgent groups who have seized important territory during the last past months.&#10;&#10;Complete special urban close-combat missions, while killing opponents and avoiding being killed by bullets, grenades, landmines or airstrikes. Accumulate kill-streaks and obtain advanced weapons to eliminate your opponents.&#10;&#10;A combination of dice, perk cards, kill-streak attacks and strategic thinking are used to move your team members within a small remote middle east village map where obstacles such as buildings, walls, military vehicles, antipersonnel landmines and others add complexity to the terrain you will move in to complete your missions.&#10;&#10;",

A plan was conceived to send fleets of Terra forming ships with vast crews in cryo.  The ships were to spend hundreds, if not thousands of years, searching the stars for a new system that could support mankind once more.  One of those fleets arrived upon &lsquo;Mu Area&rsquo; a system that surpassed expectations, providing a number of larger planets that could support life, colonization began.&#10;&#10;Now many years on the colonies established have splintered, separated and developed their own societies.  They each now take a stride to control the system and guide mankind to the future.&#10;&#10;The Game&#10;&#10;The play of the game takes place on a circular board with 3 rings that rotate around the star in the center at the end of each game round.  You are able to research an extensive list of technologies, some unique to each player, build ships, colonize and conquer.&#10;&#10;The start of the game sees an interesting aspect where the players actually create their own race with various advantages over each other.   This gives you the option to try and forge your own style or hinder others.  &#10;Victory is achieved by proving your might to the other emerging empires and obtaining the most victory points at the end of 4 rounds of play.&#10;&#10;Play is fast, lots of research, building and of course combat.  The game takes approx. 3 hours to play with very little waiting or downtime.&#10;&#10;",

To get out they have to find the samples Fluffy has hidden behind other exhibits, get Fluffy and find Rexy's bone.&#10;&#10;Every round consists of a planning phase followed by an action resolution phase. The planning is done simultaneously with a time limit. Players can choose between different actions such as gathering information about the museum or Fluffy's whereabouts, moving to another room of the museum, or searching for the hidden objects or keys. Most actions can be chosen multiple times, also by the same player, but  the overall number of actions is limited depending on the number of players.&#10;&#10;In the action resolution phase players then take the planned actions. The App controls all steps and announces whose turn it is and what to do.&#10;&#10;But beware not to be too loud - sometimes someone awakes and they have to run using keys they found.&#10;&#10;They all win if they manage to fulfill their tasks before the time is up.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The first to gain 42 followers is the winner! Gain Followers by sending Disciples on Mission Trips. Have a Preach-Off to take out an enemy. Defend against enemy Disciples with Agnostics. Beef up, slow down, or mess with the guys in play using Blessings, Curses, and Miracles. Baby Jesus, the scorekeeper, also has super powers.&#10;&#10;How to Play:&#10;&#10;All cards that you play or actions that you take happen on your own turn, in any order that you like.&#10;&#10;Communion Wafers are the currency for this game. The number on the top left of a card is how many wafers it costs to play. On the first turn you can only spend one wafer. The second turn you have two to spend. By the time the third turn comes around&hellip; You guessed it! 3 wafers! And so on. Spend them wisely and you will dominate. As the game goes on, things get very exciting because you are able to play more powerful cards. If you lose track of how many wafers you have available: Smoke less weed or keep track with dice. Your choice but the author prefers the latter.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with their Baby Jesus to the right of their deck, to help keep score. Slide a paper clip around Baby Jesus and when you get to 42 Followers, you become the winner, but more importantly - they become the loser. Baby Jesus' Super Powers help keep the game moving and are great for using up excess wafers. Only one Relic may be played on Baby Jesus at a time and may be used to damage an enemy once per turn. When it has been exhausted, it is sent to hell, a warm cozy place to the left of your deck.&#10;&#10;Besides Baby Jesus and his Relics, there are two main types of cards:&#10;&#10;1) Character cards&#10;&#10;Characters have Attack and Defense. This is how they compete with each other. If their Defense reaches zero, they are sent straight to hell. During a Mission Trip, Followers are gained equal to the Disciple&rsquo;s Attack number.&#10;&#10;Agnostics - Defenders who keep your opponent from gathering Followers. If your enemy has an Agnostic in play, you must send it to hell before your Disciples can go on a Mission Trip or have a Preach-Off against a non-Agnostic.&#10;Disciples - Offenders who may either be sent on a Mission Trip or have a Preach-Off once per turn. Without gaining Followers, you cannot win so it usually makes more sense to go on a Mission Trip. If you do elect to have a Preach-Off this is how it works: You choose the character you would like to Preach off against (remember, Agnostics must be targeted first). Defense points are deducted from both characters equal to the attack points of the opposing character. This happens at the same time. So, if a 1/5 (1 Attack, 5 Defense) dude attacks a 2/1 enemy, the enemy will perish and your Disciple is now a 1/3 [mark damage taken with pennies]. Moreover, it might be a smart move to sacrifice a 1/1 against an 8/1 to take him out of commision.&#10;&#10;2) Manipulation cards&#10;&#10;Unless otherwise stated, Blessings and Curses affect only one character. These cards may stay in play to help keep track of who they have an effect on. Whenever they become irrelevant, feel free to toss them into the fiery pit.&#10;&#10;Blessings - Turn your dudes into badasses.  &#10;Curses - Mess with your enemies.  &#10;Miracles - Save these for when you could really use one.&#10;&#10;Now let's begin:&#10;&#10;The game starts with each player shuffling their own deck and drawing 4 cards. Good cards to start with cost 1 or 2 wafers; you will be able to use them sooner. If you aren't happy with your hand, you may shuffle the cards you don't like back into the deck and replace them. You may do this twice. If you still don't like your hand, too bad. You'll draw a new card every turn so don't make a big fuss about it. Now flip a coin. The winner chooses to either go first (starting with just the 4 cards they have) or draw first.&#10;&#10;Alternative 4 player version (2-Headed-Jesus): Each team helps one Baby Jesus attract 84 followers. Each player has their own deck. Make your moves at the same time as your teammate. Help each other out. You may look at each other&rsquo;s hands to help strategize.&#10;&#10;Remember to have fun. Because if you're not having fun... What's the point?&#10;&#10;",

Each player flips a coin and moves one space for heads and two spaces for tails.  They may land on spaces that move them forward or back, cause them to lose a turn or return them to the start.  The first player to reach the finish wins.&#10;&#10;",

Eventually, they must choose the bravest among them to enter the mouth of Darkness and rescue the sun.&#10;&#10;Each round of the game (known as a &quot;day&quot;) is divided into three phases: the Dawn phase, the Challenge phase, and the Dusk phase. In the Dawn phase, each player uses their actions to move about, purify corruption, scout challenges, and share items. In the Challenge phase, each player undertakes a challenge. If they succeed, they gain rewards; if they fail, they incur penalties. In the Dusk phase, game upkeep is performed.&#10;&#10;In order to win the game, the players must choose one warrior to enter Darkness as their champion. While the champion battles inside Darkness and attempts to reach the swallowed sun, the other warriors must still defend Tallil from the encroaching shadows, lest they corrupt the world and plunge everything into eternal night. If Darkness finishes swallowing the sun, or the shadows gain too much influence in the world, then the players lose the game.&#10;&#10;",

These falling stars crashed to the surface, and in the ages to come, became enshrined in legends as the Lost Legacy. Discover where the Lost Legacy can be found and win the game!&#10;&#10;Lost Legacy: Third Chronicle contains two sets of game cards: Sacred Grail and Staff of Dragons. Each set can be played independently or mixed together with other sets to create a unique custom set.&#10;&#10;As for how to play, Lost Legacy is a game of risk, deduction, and luck for 2&ndash;4 players. You start the game with one card in hand from a deck of sixteen cards. On a turn, you do the following:&#10;&#10;&#10;         Draw: Draw the top card from the deck and add it to your hand.&#10;         Play: Choose one of the two cards in hand to play and place it face up in front of you.&#10;         Effect: Carry out the played card's effect, after which the card is considered as discarded.&#10;         End: Throughout gameplay you're trying to eliminate other players or uncover the location of the &quot;Lost Legacy&quot; card; this card might also be in the &quot;Ruins&quot;, a location that holds one card at the start of the game and possibly acquires more cards during play. When someone discovers the Lost Legacy, the game ends, everyone tallies the value of the cards they've played and the card left in hand, and whoever has the highest total wins.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;By combining different Lost Legacy sets (while keeping only a single Lost Legacy card in play), up to six players can compete at the same time.&#10;&#10;",

This is a solitaire game; the player controls German forces (including the Italian forces) and the game system controls the opposing Allied (British Commonwealth and Greek forces) reaction. The objective of the game is for the Germans to capture Crete at the lowest possible cost in terms of casualties. You have the option to maneuver German units as you desire within the rules&rsquo; allowances. But, when a rule calls for the Allies to do something, you the player must execute that action.&#10;&#10;There are two general types of turns in the game: Preparation and Operational. Preparation turns gives the players additional Operations Points (markers) that can be used to enhance actions, as well as refitting reduced units. In Operational turns, the player executes movement and combat with German forces.&#10;The map shows Crete and the surrounding seas, with displays representing the German staging areas in mainland Greece and each unit represents anything from a battalion to a brigade.&#10;&#10;World at War Magazine #47, April-May 2016.&#10;&#10;Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 176 counters&#10;&#10;",
