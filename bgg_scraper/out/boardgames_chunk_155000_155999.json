The players start at the station of their color and have to visit all other stations, where they leave a car on a sidetrack. Then they have to get the engine back to their home Station to win the game. When the player rolls a 1 or 4, he may adjust one of the two railroad switches. This is important because other trains can only be overtaken on parallel tracks.&#10;&#10;This game was published in the 1930s or 1940s.&#10;&#10;",

Colors always must be matched, but numbers can either be matched or played to make scoring combinations.&#10;&#10;The object is to play all diamonds from the hand as quickly as possible in either matching or scoring combinations.  Players left with diamonds suffer penalties.  Each player, therefore, tries (1) to play out all diamonds from his hand as quickly as possible and (2) to make as many scoring combinations as he can.&#10;&#10;Hands are played until a game of 200 points, or some other predetermined count is reached.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

The once mighty empire of Arowyth has fractured, and the feudal lords have crowned themselves kings, each bent on expanding their realms and laying claim to the ancient imperial title.  Alliances have worn thin, and the thirst for power has driven them to war with each other.  But they are not the only forces vying for power.  The Malador, foreign marauders, have taken advantage of the chaos to satisfy their lust for conquest and plunder by ravaging the land.&#10;&#10;In War of Kings, you will assume the role of one of the rival kings.  Immediately, you will be faced with decisions on every round of play about how best to expand your realm.  During the Construction Phase, in which all players play simultaneously, you will generate resources, collect gold, build settlements, fortify them, and raise armies.  The combat system provides many opportunities for tactical and strategic decisions.  Wage war with our custom combat dice using a mechanic that engages both the attacking and defending player.  You must also contend with the Maladorian Marauders, an evil horde controlled by a card-based mechanic that allows the players to decide how best to wreak havoc on the other kingdoms of Arowyth.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The MAGNATES: A Game of Power, a.k.a. Bo&#197;&#188;e Igrzysko: MAGNACI, presents the history of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, from its heyday during the Union of Lublin (XVI century) until the collapse of the state (XVIII century). Players take on the roles of the magnates, who seek to develop the power of their families in the favorable time: the peak of the Polish and Lithuanian Union.&#10;&#10;Each player has a deck of cards that depicts celebrities of his family. Some of them are capable of great deeds and some will spoil any project with which they are entrusted &mdash; but with a good player's decisions, even those small souls could do a lot for his family.&#10;&#10;During the game, players manage the deck of their characters to achieve, in competition with others, as much as possible on each of the planes of life of the Republic. The fate of the country results from the sum of the activities of the most powerful aristocratic families. If the players fall into a mutual fight for titles and advantages, the Republic will fall under the pressure of neighboring powers.&#10;&#10;This game for 2-5 players with a game time not exceeding 90 minutes reimplements Martin Wallace's Bo&#197;&#188;e Igrzysko from 2010, using the same principal title in Polish edition under an agreement with the author.&#10;&#10;From the back of the game box:&#10;&#10;The MAGNATES: A Game of Power is a strategic board game for 2-5 players which is fast and full of historical atmosphere and rich interactions. It takes you into the world of aristocratic intrigues and struggles for power which tore the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth from its heyday during the Union of Lublin, until the Targowica Confederation and the fall of the Polish-Lithuanian state.&#10;&#10;Players take on the roles of magnates who seek to develop their own family's power in a moment favorable to fortune: the prime of the Union of Poland and Lithuania. The most eminent families fight for prestige and landed estates: the Lubomirski, the Potocki, the Radziwi&#197;&#130;&#197;&#130;, the Sapieha and the Zamoyski.&#10;&#10;Each player has a deck of cards depicting well-known personages from a given family. Some of these characters are outstanding people, capable of great deeds. But there are also less useful people, able to spoil any undertaking entrusted them... unless, thanks to the player's decisions, even those lesser ones will do much for the family.&#10;&#10;During the game, players will manage their deck of characters so that, in competition with others, they can achieve as much as possible on each of the planes of life of the Commonwealth. Players will clash during the creation of the state's internal policy, as well as in response to external threats and opportunities arising from the international situation. And so, as it happened in reality, the fate of the country will be the result of the sum of actions of the most powerful aristocratic families. If the players lose themselves in a mutual fight for titles and advantage, the Commonwealth will collapse under the pressure of the neighboring powers.&#10;&#10;In MAGNATES, players will face many dilemmas. The most prominent members of the family will ensure beneficial rights in the Sejm and prestigious positions in the Senate. Moreover, they comply with the Monarch's will easily, and thanks to them the family will gain estates and power. But how will a player handle the remaining challenges? Who will undertake an expedition to Livonia? Will the troops protecting the country against enemy invasion, in the absence of other candidates, be again led by incompetents (like &quot;peryna, latyna and dytyna&rdquo;)? Will there be enough determination to hasten to the relief of Vienna? Will the players succeed in saving the Homeland from partitioning?&#10;&#10;Is your Family ready for a Game of Power?&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The year is 1897 and to celebrate sixty years of the reign of Queen Victoria and bring much needed solace to the Country's weary workers, four seaside resorts vie with each other to be the grandest and most opulent, worthy of a Royal visit from Her Majesty herself. The latest in steam technology will be on display to attract and transport visitors to the hotels and guest houses that line the seafronts. Amusements and monuments will be created to edify and delight the visiting holiday-makers. You, as the designer of these developments must complete your resort first and claim your rightful place as Chief Architect, by Royal Appointment! Help is available from enigmatic and mysterious personages: Donkey-boy, Lord Admiral, Princess Royal and Madame Ice-cream. They may prove invaluable but are fickle and may aid your opponents, too!&#10;&#10;Steam Donkey is a card game that is fun but has depth to its strategic play. You will make decisions about when to take cards into your hand from the resort and whether to build in the Park, Beach or Town area. You, as the Architect will have to choose which characters will be of most use to you each turn and which projects they will help you construct. All for the glory of having the most magnificent resort in the land!&#10;&#10;An unusual mechanism in the game is that the reverse of each card is as important as its front. The reverse shows holiday-makers (&quot;the Visitors&quot;) arriving at a railway station complete with suitcases and their mechanical dog. The suitcases are color-coded to show the area of the resort to which the Visitors are destined. This area could be either the Park, the Town or the Beach. After they arrive, these same Visitors may be collected to the player's hand &mdash; but at this juncture the fronts of the cards become the focus of play. The players build amusements, lodgings, monuments and transport within the three areas, and this information is shown on the card fronts together with a point value. In order to build, a player discards a prescribed number of cards of the same type as the card being built. Of course, there is a little more to the game than this...&#10;&#10;Four Character cards &mdash; Madame Ice-cream, Lord Admiral, Princess Royal and Donkey-boy &mdash; are swapped between players to enhance card play, and four Kick-on cards in the advanced game &mdash; The Castle, Mechanical Dog, The Bank, and Feral Donkey &mdash; give the owning player a particular advantage and are retained throughout the game.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "InEPTT is a skirmish game that runs from 1890 thru to 2020. It pits small elite teams of &quot;Agents&quot; against the evils and aliens of this world. The monsters are normally referred to as creatures and the Aliens as &quot;XRAYs&quot;. InEPTT is built with three basic Genres of play 1890 to 1930, 1930 to 1960 and 1960 to 2020.&#10;&#10;These genres have various weapons armouries with which you can build your teams to take on the Creatures and XRAY's that you will face. The game uses the term Mission for a single scenario and Operation for a series of linked Missions. You can build your team as you go as you collect credits with successful mission completion and &quot;kills&quot; of Creatures and XRAYs. The game is run by a Game Master (GM) who designs and runs the missions and or operations and the scope is massive!&#10;&#10;There are two &quot;Missions&quot; in the core rules but those missions lend themselves to quick development into literally hundreds of missions with minor tweaks to terrain, victory conditions and forces involved. Some of the key points for InEPTT from a mini/terrain view point is &ndash; there are no specific miniatures that you &quot;must&quot; buy. You can use just about anything you want really, the one stipulation being that Allies and Henchmen should be a What You See is What You Get concept, but for your Agents (term for InEPTT Soldiers) you can use any figure you like. Also the teams range from 3 to 12 so you don't need hordes of figures although your XRAYs and Creatures will often need to out number Agents by as many as 3 to 1 and for zombies 5 to 1 or more &ndash; but that is up to the GM. Also the games usually run from 30 minutes (small 4 x 4 table) to 4 hours for massive 10 x 6 table with 5 teams and over 40 bad guys, with all teams having separate Mission Orders to complicate the system even more. The game has huge amounts of growth still and there is depth in every category from which to develop more and more.&#10;&#10;",

It consists of a 3-piece (puzzle type) game board, 3 cardboard figures (Paddington, Mr. and Mrs. Brown) and 25 plastic chips as well as 2 colour dice. The game board has spots in red, blue yellow etc. round in a circle. In game variation one all 3 figures are placed randomly on the board. On his turn a player rolls both dice. He/she assigns each roll to a figure on the board and moves two figures according to the die roll. E.g. the dice show red and yellow: then the player must move 2 of the three figures. One on any red space, one on any yellow space. When the three figures are located next to each other a photo is shot. The player achieving the photo shot gets a chip as reward. Once a photo is completed the middle figure runs away to the opposite space of the same colour. After 20 photos are shot the game ends, player with the most chips wins. In a variation a photo is especially well taken when Paddington is in the middle. Then the player gets 2 chips for this kind of photo shot. After all 25 chips are exhausted the game ends.&#10;&#10;",

It takes place directly after Dawn &ndash; Rise of the Occulites and has you representing an Occulite Tribe that didn&rsquo;t quite collect enough Sungems for the Long Dark. You do not need to have played Dawn previously or be aware of the Rise of the Occulites setting, but knowing the setting obviously helps with understanding the theme of the game.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to be the only Tribe that is undiscovered at the end of a Round. The player with the most wins after three Rounds wins. Draws go to the player who has the most Sungems in total after those three rounds.&#10;&#10;On average games/rounds take 10-15 minutes depending on the number of players. Games of Sungem Run! are tense and exciting as you try and find out who the other player&rsquo;s Tribe is and then how to expose them without exposing yourself. A game of sneakiness, misdirection and deduction, Sungem Run! is a blast to play!&#10;&#10;",

The captain has ordered Palmer to prime the auto-destruct. It mustn&rsquo;t get back! Save our souls.&#10;&#10;&#10;Lifeform is a game of survival horror for two to four players in which one player takes on the role of an almost invincible, utterly hostile alien, while all other players take on the roles of the crew of commercial mining starship, Valley Forge. During each game, the crew, outfitted with glitchy handheld sensors disrupted by a proximate nebula, search their labyrinthine vessel for equipment, weaponry, and supplies to load onboard escape shuttlecraft Remora. Along the way, the alien lifeform will ruthlessly attempt to stop the crew from carrying out this plan.&#10;&#10;The crew and alien lifeform both have a unique deck of cards, and each card has symbols on it to indicate possible actions. The alien can move around the starship, attack, cocoon, activate a malfunctioning android, sabotage equipment and the vessel's wiring, scurry into vents, and more; while the starship crew can fire flamethrowers, search, move or run, protect themselves with shock-prods, hide, shut security doors, and other actions.&#10;&#10;Lifeform is a standalone, dice-less game that tells of twelve commercial astronauts working on a battered mining starship, far away in space and time, who encounter an awesome galactic horror. Featuring an innovative self-destruct game mechanism, and alternate playable endings, depending on crew success, Lifeform presents a tense, suspenseful adventure with each and every game.&#10;&#10;",

But only one guild may lead in the end, so players must battle against each other as well as against the monstrous occupying forces.&#10;&#10;Arcadia Quest is a campaign-based game for 2 to 4 players, where each player controls a guild of three unique heroes, facing off against the other players and the various monsters controlled by the game. Players need to accomplish a series of quests in order to win each scenario and choose where to go next in the campaign.&#10;&#10;Players are able to choose the path their campaign takes, navigating through six out of eleven available scenarios, so each time the campaign is played it can have a different configuration of scenarios. As the campaign progresses, the heroes are able to acquire new weapons, equipment and abilities that give them powerful options to tackle the obstacles ahead. Furthermore, by fulfilling specific quests in a scenario, players unlock exclusive features in subsequent scenarios.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "SETTING&#10;In this Dieselpunk universe, after the first Global War the world experienced several advances in technology but was still in a state of distrust, with a second Global War all but guaranteed to happen.&#10;However, an unexpected alien invasion forced the world's nations to cooperate, as the threat seemed impossible to be dealt individualy. The comanders enlisted to lead the First Response Initiative are capable and will fight fiercely to defend humanity, but they are still a product of their era and therefore are very interested in their own agenda as well: after the invasion ends, they want a place of power for themselves.&#10;&#10;THE MENACE&#10;In First Response, you know very little about your enemy. You only know that they are stronger, have incredible technology and are very aggressive.&#10;Where are they from? What are their objectives? You will probably never know.&#10;They invaded without warning and never attempted to communicate. It is impossible to interrogate them as most of their soldiers dissolve in a pile of goo seconds after dying and the corpses of their leaders are also of little help (you can&rsquo;t keep them alive  for more than a few hours).&#10;You don&rsquo;t even know how they talk among themselves as they emit almost no sound (and some don&rsquo;t even have a mouth).&#10;Your soldiers are prone to panic when confronting them and you do not have enough resources to build and research what you need, let alone what you want.&#10;What can you possibly do to change that?&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY&#10;In First Response, whenever you prepare to fight or actually fight the alien menace you might gain Victory Points.&#10;Each game round has two phases: Scanning for Activity and Action.&#10;In the scanning for Activity Phase, players will &ldquo;seed&rdquo; the world, dictating the rhythm of the game and setting everything up for the next Phase.&#10;In the Action Phase, players can do one of two things: manage their bases or go into a mission.&#10;While managing your base you will spend resources to recruit personnel, build facilities, research new technologies and so on.&#10;Missions can be on the air or on the ground and they are the best opportunity to acquire VP and put your hands in precious loot (like parts from alien ships). It is also an opportunity to promote your rookies to veterans (if they survive) an gain medals for acts of bravery (or stupidity).&#10;The game is played in this manner until the Response Marker reaches the Game Over, Man space or until the Terror Marker reaches  a certain point in the Terror Track.&#10;Both conditions trigger the final phase of the game: the Assault on the Alien Base, a very difficult mission with special conditions for  acquiring Victory Points.&#10;&#10;OBJECTIVE&#10;As the commander of one of First Response Initiative (FRI) bases in a secret location in the world, your personal objective is to be recognized as the best one to lead us against the alien menace.&#10;The winner of First Response is the one with most Victory Points (VP) by the end of the game.&#10;If you manage to destroy the Alien Base at the end, the winner will be chosen as the new leader of the FRI.&#10;If you fail, the winner will  be the leader of the underground resistance against the new master race on the planet.&#10;In that case, the game will be over, but the fight will continue...&#10;&#10;THE STANDARD AND ADVANCED RULES&#10;The first part of the rulebook comprises the standard set of rules of the game, with more complicated cards and interactions available in the Advanced Rules.&#10;The standard rules are enough for a great experience and veteran gamers should not skip it, as at least one play with this more straightforward approach can significantly enhance further plays as you have the opportunity to get acquainted with the game flow and to get a firm grasp of the rules.&#10;The advanced rules will add variety and complexity. Timing will be much more important. Negotiations will be much more important. Knowing what your opponents are planning will be much more important. And the aliens will also be tougher.&#10;You will also have more tools to deal with the aliens and to change the game environment. You also can, if you want, add just some elements of the Advanced Rules and introduce them to your game group in small doses.&#10;Keep in mind, though that some of the advanced rules complement each other and work better with the full set of rules.&#10;&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS&#10;The standard rules are for games of 3 to 5 players. However, the 5-player game requires some minor alterations that are highlighted in the rulebook when necessary.&#10;&#10;OPTIONAL DIFICULTIES AND MODULES&#10;First Response also comes with some optional stuff. Those includes difficulty settings for the game (including the sadistic IRONMAN MODE), a customizable way to taylor how the game advances and a cooperative variant. The cooperative variant supports 2 to 4 players.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "POOP is an UNO-like game where the first player to run out of cards wins! Players are given a 5-card hand and take turns laying cards (pooping) but trying not to clog the toilet! If the toilet is clogged the player must pick up the entire poop stack and a new toilet is started. If 3 cards of the same color are played in a row then the toilet is Flushed and that toilet is reset with zero poop cards. Some cards make players perform crazy acts on their turns.&#10;&#10;POOP: The Game is an original card game created by kids and adults for kids and adults. Kids love it because of the silly designs and opportunity to make poop jokes. Adults love it because POOP makes them act like kids.&#10;&#10;EDUCATIONAL: Younger children get a healthy dose of basic math while playing POOP. Seriously! You'll see them adding up the POOP cards to make sure they don't clog the toilet!&#10;&#10;INTERACTION: One of the funnest stages of UNO is remembering to say &quot;UNO&quot; when down to your last card. POOP takes this one step further giving players similar responsibilities throughout the entire game. If you forget and other players remind you then you have to draw another card (and take a drink if you're playing POOP as a drinking game. Speaking of...)&#10;&#10;DRINKING GAME FOR ADULTS: After getting feedback from our successful (and critically acclaimed) ZOMBIE SHUFFLE campaign, we learned that many people loved that we included drinking rules. For this reason we've made POOP an even easier drinking game. Players take drinks if they draw a card or clog the toilet and everyone drinks if the toilet is flushed.&#10;&#10;ENDLESS POSSIBILITIES: We've found at least 3 other exciting ways to play POOP using the same standard deck! You'll find the Alternate Rules PDF in the downloadable Trial Version of POOP but we are very interested in what you come up with when playing with friends and family. Experiment and send us your ideas! We'll credit you if we share it with the POOP community.&#10;&#10;",

Players score points for being the first to fill the Ark, collecting the most mammals, collecting sets of three different birds, reptiles or amphibians, etc. They should also remember not to place herbivores next to predators, as carnivores will simply try to eat other animals.&#10;&#10;The game has various difficulty levels, introducing the possibility to balance the Ark's sides and managing grain supplies.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, the player first declares which city they want to attack, then rolls all ten dice. Any dice showing the &quot;nuke&quot; symbol are locked and cannot be rerolled. Laser guns are similarly locked, allowing the player to reroll only the alien heads. If the player rerolls and ever has as many nuke symbols showing as the number on the face-up cards and the supplementary token, their turn ends; otherwise they can stop at any time, and if they don't have enough guns or alien heads to claim their target, they mark their total with one of their tokens, allowing them to add on to this number on a future turn &mdash; assuming that someone else doesn't claim the card first.&#10;&#10;Some city cards have special powers, such as Seattle's, which allows you to place one die on the symbol of your choice prior to rolling. Las Vegas, true to its nature, wants you to go bust multiple times in order to claim the card. Whoever ends up decimating the largest portion of the earth wins. Ak ak ak ak ak!&#10;&#10;",

A promise has been broken, an evil omen is in the sky, a crown is at stake, and history is about to be made...&#10;&#10;1066, Tears to Many Mothers is an asymmetric, competitive, tactical card game in the style of Magic the Gathering, but non-collectable. Each player, as either Normans or Saxons, musters troops and resources to overcome the various obstacles in their way before the two armies clash on the battlefield at Hastings.&#10;&#10;Every card in the game is inspired by a real person or event from the time. With a focus on quick, tactical play and a thematic re-imagining of the events of the time, there is no deck building required, each player simply grabs their deck and shuffles, then play begins.&#10;&#10;Honours: 1066, Tears to Many Mothers was a runner up in the Golden Geek Awards, and was nominated in the Origins Awards for 'Best Historical Board Game'.&#10;&#10;Note on title: In April of 1066 Halley's Comet was in its perihelion orbit and writers at the time said it was four times the size of Venus and shining with a light equal to a quarter of that of the Moon. Many thought it was an evil omen, or even the end of the world - the monk Eilmer of Malmesbury Abbey wrote about the event: &quot;You've come, have you? &ndash; You've come, you source of tears to many mothers. It is long since I saw you; but as I see you now you are much more terrible, for I see you brandishing the downfall of my country.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Pijin iz a gam ov fonetik speleng &amp; a disarmingly fun new experience of words for everyone!&#10;&#10;Pijin is the world&rsquo;s first spelling game of the spoken word. It's a hackable, expandable game that emphasizes the physical experience of communication. To play, you spell what you hear and only what you hear in pronunciation,  and you spell with phonemes. &quot;Pigeon&quot; is spelled /pijin/, &quot;words&quot; becomes /wurdz/, &quot;spelling&quot; is /speleng/, and so on.  Familiar terms sometimes look completely strange, but that's part of the fun as players explore and tinker with language itself.&#10;&#10;There is no board used.  Each phoneme tile is worth one point.  The player with the most points wins. In Pijin Grid the object is to create a crossword-style matrix of intersecting words, one point for each tile in every word created by tile placement.  In Pijin Sprint players may choose to create either a list or an intersecting grid of 10 words that respond to a prompt, Action Card.  The grid may take longer but offers more scoring possibilities.  Pijin ships with one set of 52 Action Cards as the game's first &quot;module,&quot; but more modules of different themes are planned for release.&#10;&#10;",

Where most games on this period focus in on the famous Battle of Leipzig, Beyond Leipzig takes in the full scope of the military, economic, and diplomatic possibilities inherent in the 1813 situation. The Allies must re-defeat Napoleon, still reeling from his disastrous failed invasion of Russia. The French must avoid that outcome and secure their empire in central Europe.&#10;&#10;",

As soon as they start crying, you won't be able to make them happy again. When a player is faced with five crying babies, the game is over and the other players score points for all non-crying babies. Every baby has a point value that is known only by the owner of the baby.&#10;&#10;To make your life hard in the daycare center, opponents will attach bad cards to your babies so that they become unhappy. At the end of your turn, you have to find a solution for an unhappy baby or he'll start crying. A few things that happen in the game are stolen pacifiers, babies that need a diaper change, and crying babies that receive a toy horn so they can make even more noise. For almost every card played there is a reaction. For example, if an opponent makes your baby nervous, you can play calming music from a mobile, but as a reaction they can break your mobile to keep the baby nervous. You can feed your baby, but your opponents can steal your food...&#10;&#10;If you don't have the right cards to keep your babies happy, don't worry. Your colleagues are there to help! During your turn you can trade cards with other players. If you receive the right card in your turn you can still make your babies happy again and prevent them from crying. But be aware your colleagues can also try to trick you by giving a different card as the one they promised! So do you want to make friends so you maybe could also get a little help later in the game or do you just want to make your colleagues completely mad? It's up to you!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Subdivision mimics the city-building feel of B&eacute;zier Games' Suburbia, but differs in scope as now each player has been allocated a specific area in which to create the best possible subdivision, filling it with residential, commercial, industrial, civic, and luxury zones, while balancing various improvements to the area, including roads, schools, parks, sidewalks, and lakes. By the end of the game, each player will have created a unique, custom neighborhood with areas that interact with each other, hoping to outscore the competition by having the best subdivision.&#10;&#10;In the game, each player starts with a subdivision player board and a hand of hex-shaped zone tiles. A parcel die is rolled to indicate the type of parcel where a zone tile may be placed, and all players simultaneously place one of their tiles. If a zone tile is placed next to existing zone tiles, those existing tiles have the ability to create new improvements, which may also be placed at this time. Those improvements provide money and points, while slowly covering up as many parcels as possible. Players pass the remaining zone tiles in hand to their left, then someone rolls the parcel die once again. This continues until only one zone tile remains in hand, which is discarded.&#10;&#10;Players then play another round, but at the start of the second, third, and fourth rounds, players first check to see whether they've achieved bonuses, which give them extra cash or allow for extra activations of certain zone tiles.&#10;&#10;After four rounds, the game ends, and scores are tallied, with players gaining points for parks being adjacent to other tiles, sidewalks passing through as many different zones and improvements as possible, schools ranking the best in the city, and zones connecting to the highway that runs around (or through) your subdivision.&#10;&#10;",

The players then determine the result of the initial round based on the attack, defense and orientation of the pew-pew die and then make moves from this initial position to conclude the game.&#10;&#10;For each round thereafter a player's die can only be changed in the following ways:&#10;&#10;1) A die can be rotated 90-degrees clockwise or counter-clockwise only after flipping&#10;&#10;2) A pew-pew die can be flipped onto its front (the side closest the opponent), left or right sides&#10;&#10;Play proceeds for as many rounds as the players desire, up to a pre-determined number of wins -- typically three works best.&#10;&#10;This game is inspired by the dice jousting mechanism used by Bushi Shogi.&#10;&#10;",

A player may Move their duelist by either rotating 90 degrees or stepping diagonally - maintaining contact with the opponent. Striking requires that you line up one of your Duelist's attack angles toward his opponent. Both Movement and Strike actions can be modified by offensive cards in hand.  After a Strike is declared the opposing player may play defense cards from their hand to mitigate or even cancel the damage. If the Strike is successful the attack value is compared to the defense value and the difference is the damage dealt to the opposing Duelist. Each Duelist starts out with 40 hit points.

Intermediate mode introduces Battleflag cards, which can be played to mess with your opponent and provide additional scoring opportunities.&#10;&#10;The Master Gunner cards add an additional layer to the game once you're ready. This set of 4 cards for each faction provide fun ways to mess with your opponent.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Legends of the Wulin is a board-game of Wuxia adventure and drama set in the genre-loyal universe of  Ancient China for 2-6 players.&#10;&#10;In this game players take on the role of Wuxia heroes &ndash; men and women who pursue their virtuous goals through the perfection of their martial abilities.  Players complete quests in  support of their individual (and secret) goals, fight bandits, rebels, cults, and other Wuxia heroes while developing their Kungfu abilities and cultivating their &ldquo;Qi&rdquo;.   The story which the players create within the game is different every game, as their secret agenda is always different.  The story plot &ndash; as told by the mission the players struggle to complete &ndash; follows story elements from popular wuxia movies and novels.&#10;&#10;Xiake &ndash; noble fighters of the martial arts community &ndash; live to embody their personal virtues.  They express these virtues in their main goals: defeat the tyrant emperor&hellip; or support the law against the rebels;  defeat the heterodox sects&hellip; or support the traditional leaders of the Wulin; become the Wulin Mengzhu &ndash; recognized leader of the martial arts community&hellip; or burn down the community in revenge.  Each of these goals is a secret which the player keeps until the final battle, where the player will fight against his main rival.&#10;&#10;Legends of the Wulin is both a strategic and tactical game.  On a strategic level, players compete to finish quests faster than the competition, thereby gaining access to better fighting abilities.  Tactically, the combat system of LOTW incorporates a short battle card game, in which players play individual Kungfu &ldquo;stances&rdquo; against each other to get the upper hand within a three-round battle.&#10;&#10;Legends of The Wulin  typically takes 2-3 hours to play.  A large-ish table is required because the board, cards, and charactersheets take up a lot of space.  The rules are not particularly complex and is easy to pick-up.  Mastering the game requires keen strategic thinking as well as experience learning the different Kungfu stances and abilities.  However, this is an adventure game, and players are encouraged to &ldquo;role-play&rdquo; their character&rsquo;s adventure.&#10;&#10;",

Players assume the role of security employees that spend their office hours hacking into their employer's own mainframe. The goal of the game is  to blackmail your boss into giving you a promotion, which is achieved by collecting a stash of state secrets and juicy office gossip. The first players to have 14 Secrets wins the game.&#10;&#10;Every turn, players have the choice to spend one of their Secrets to start a new hack (rerolling the dice pool), or simply scavenge for remains from the previous hack. They then choose an action from the die pool, removing it from the pool in the process. Players constantly have to weigh up their needs: which option to take yourself vs. which option not to leave for others, and creating new options for yourself vs. not creating new options for others.&#10;&#10;This game was originally created for Randall's Dice Or No Dice contest, which ran in January 2014 on BoardGameGeek.&#10;&#10;",

Each other player receives one card in each of five categories &mdash; companion, transportation, location, occupation, accommodation &mdash; as well as a &quot;Best&quot; or &quot;Worst&quot; goal card.

India stood at the center of this sprawling imperial network, and the currents of empire ran through its ports, tying the Far East with European markets and awarding the British virtual control of the vast wealth of the subcontinent. However, the &quot;crown jewel&quot; of the empire was far from secure.&#10;&#10;Across the forests of Siberia and the steppes of Asia, the Russian Empire advanced at a rate exceeding even the pace of America's western pioneers. This expansionism by the world&rsquo;s largest nation loomed over British holdings in India, casting a longer shadow each year. In the buffer region of central Asia, surveyors, adventurers, industrialists and government agents crossed paths, all seeking to manipulate the byzantine local politics. There, in the shadow of the Pamir Mountains, the stage was set for a game that would define the limits of global power in the 19th century and the present day.&#10;&#10;In Pax Pamir, two to five players assume the role of Afghan tribal leaders navigating the winds of colonial power in &quot;The Great Game&quot;. If either the Russian, British Empire, or Afghan is able to achieve supremacy, the player with the most influence in that empire wins.&#10;&#10;",

Each turn one card is played and one drawn. Since the cards are shuffled and distributed randomly, you will often end up having to play your opponent's color. &#10;2) The cards are numbered 1 to 9 (2 of each, so 18 cards per color). To place a new card on an existing card, whatever the color, the numbers must match. &#10;3) The cards stay on the table once played and gameplay continues until the decided number of tokens is obtained. &#10;4) Finally, there are a handful of cards that allow you to remove one card position or a whole row of cards.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Captain's Sea is a low-to-moderate complexity game for two players who take the roles as captains of the original American frigates (Chesapeake, Congress, Constellation, Constitution, President, and United States) or their opponents from the British or French navies during the turn of the 19th Century. All of the classic duels fought by these ships are represented in detail. Unlike other age of sail games that focus on fleet actions, Captain&rsquo;s Sea puts you on the deck of a single ship with the responsibility of leading her to victory. You must maneuver against the wind and your opponent to achieve optimum firepower, as well as manage your crew as they scramble to man the guns, work the rigging, and repair battle damage, all while being hammered by the burning shot and flying splinters caused by your enemy. Can you keep your crew in good order or will you be the first to strike the colors?&#10;&#10;The action of the game is driven by control of the weather gauge. This is done in a unique fashion by moving ships relative to both the wind and each other, stressing the benefit of position. The ship with the better position has greater flexibility in maneuver as each player predetermines his ship&rsquo;s movement through a simple action selection process that does not require pencil and paper to track. Players must also allocate available crew points (a diminishing commodity as a ship takes damage) to man the guns, rigging, or other actions that the situation might mandate. A deck of action cards provides period flavor and swings of fortune. Throughout a turn, you as captain, are bombarded with difficult decisions that determine the fate of your ship.&#10;&#10;Included with the game are ten scenarios, including such classic engagements as the Constellation vs. L&rsquo;Insurgete (9 February 1799), Constitution vs. Guerrier (19 August 1812), and Chesapeake vs. Shannon (1 June 1813). Even those ships that did not fight a major engagement get the opportunity to play out a historical opportunity missed. Additionally, players will find it easy to create hypothetical pairings to see what might happen.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "New York 1776 is the first volume of the American Revolution Campaigns series.  It is strategic in scope with battles tactically carried out on a battle board.  Wooden blocks are used for fog of war.  This campaign involves point to point land and water zone movement.  Group movement can only be done with commanders and some commanders can move faster than others. The British win by capturing Washington or reducing his army and holding New York City at the end of the game.  The Americans win by avoiding British victory or reducing the British army to less than 20 strength points.  Quick playing, deep strategy, and battles that show the weakness of militia facing trained professionals.&#10;&#10;The New York 1776 campaign of the American Revolution  pitted a newly formed American army, comprised of Continentals and militia, facing a large, highly disciplined British army that included a significant number of Hessian soldiers. This campaign involved the largest number of troops of the war. An inexperienced army faced a very experienced one. It unfolded with an intricate set of maneuvers around New York City and its waterways involving a large British fleet executing numerous amphibious landings in an effort to trap the Colonials. It was truly the best opportunity the British had for capturing Washington and America&rsquo;s entire army. Historically, the Americans just barely escaped to live and fight another day. Can you, as the British player, defeat the American army and end their revolution in its infancy? Or as the American player can you, like Washington, defend your country while avoiding disaster?  The decisions are yours&hellip;&#10;&#10;",

Compete against your fellow pirates to hunt and take down merchant ships of varying value in order to increase your overall wealth.  The pirate with the most booty after all merchant ships have been captured becomes the most infamous pirate and wins the game.&#10;&#10;The board is made up of hex tiles and can be set randomly or as agreed upon by all players.  The majority of the hexes are open seas, but watch out for obstacles! Sea serpents, giant squid, super volcanoes, ship wrecks, and sand bars all stand in the way of you and your reward.  Navigate through the obstacles by moving in only one direction each turn.  Land on a hex on which a merchant ship lies to capture your booty.  To secure your prize permanently, take the merchant ship to Black Bart's Lagoon.  Be careful to avoid other pirates, as they can steal the ship before you get to Black Bart's Lagoon.  The lagoon, along with the tavern, fortress, and port, are all special hex tiles that serve different purposes in the game.  As you roam the seas, watch out for the navy!  If the naval ship lands on the same hex as you, you are sent back to your home port.&#10;&#10;Once a ship is brought to Black Bart's Lagoon and secured, you can either hold on to your booty or invest it in special equipment that could potentially help you commandeer additional ships.  In the end, the player with the most cash in hand, not including special equipment, is the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;",

Then draw a number of coach cards equal to the number of players. Secretly pick which coach to rob then negotiate with other players at the same coach whether to share or fight for the spoils. If there are no other players then you rob the coach.

In a constantly changing environment, they must adapt their strategy and tactics &mdash; but much more is required to be the very best...&#10;&#10;Tracker: A Post Nuclear Disaster is a competitive post-apocalyptic board game in which even the dead still have a chance at winning. Each player starts in one of the six Shelters. When all have spawned, the first mission objective is revealed. Afterwards it's a race from corner to corner of hexagons but the players must decide whether their priority is to arm themselves, rush to finish a mission, or venture inside an anomaly to pick up artefacts, i.e., power ups.&#10;&#10;Missions and artefacts are worth points, but so is killing and looting other players. When the first player collects the set amount of winning points or is the last living player, he is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;If at any point of the game you get killed, you respawn as a zombie. The gameplay changes a little bit and you must hunt down at least one player to be able to respawn as a living player. This means that the game does not end when you die, and you can still win the game.&#10;&#10;",

The richest surviving gangster wins the game!&#10;&#10;Ca$h 'n Guns helps you relive the best scenes of your favorite gangster movies. The goal is to have more money than anyone else after eight rounds while still being alive.&#10;&#10;Each round, one player is the Boss, and he controls the pace of play. First, loot cards are revealed on the table to show what's up for grabs. Next, players load their guns by secretly selecting either a &quot;Bang!&quot; or a &quot;Click! Click!&quot; card from their hand. The Boss counts to three, and on &quot;Three&quot; each player points his foam gun at someone else; due to his status, the Boss can tell one player who's pointing a gun at him that he needs to point it in another direction. After a pause to observe threats and measure the seriousness in an opponent's eyes, the Boss counts to three again and anyone who doesn't want to risk getting shot can chicken out and remove themselves from the round.&#10;&#10;Everyone who's pointing a gun at someone still in the round now reveals their card, and anyone who's the target of a &quot;Bang!&quot; takes a wound marker and gets none of the available loot. Starting with the Boss, everyone still in the round takes one loot card at a time from the table &mdash; money, diamonds, paintings, the position of Boss, medical care (to remove a wound), or a new bullet (to add a &quot;Bang!&quot; card to your hand) &mdash; until everything has been claimed.&#10;&#10;After eight rounds, the game ends. Whoever has the most diamonds receives a big bonus, and paintings score based on the number of them that you've collected. Whoever has the most valuable stash wins!&#10;&#10;",

Melds (or sets) are scored by adding their values (e.g. three 2's would be 6 points; a run of 4, 5, 6 would be 15 points). Melds can also be stolen from the other player by setting down the same Meld, but in your color. The opponent's Meld that the active player matched then goes into the active player's hand.&#10;&#10;Special cards in the deck allow for &quot;wilds&quot; in the sets as well as the two players switching colors.&#10;&#10;A turn ends after the active player has discarded a card.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player has scored 100 points.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Modern War #15, Jan-Feb 2015&#10;&#10;Red Tide West: The Cold War &amp; World War III in Europe is a wargame that simulates a hypothetical Warsaw Pact invasion of West Germany in the late-1980&rsquo;s. Red Tide West also presumes a wider conflict beyond the scope of the game, but postulates West Germany to be the so-called &ldquo;center of gravity&rdquo; for the entire war. In other words, regardless of what is happening in, say, Scandinavia, or the Balkans, or the Middle East, etc., the presumption here is that the war will be won or lost in central Europe. To wit, if the Red Army cripples NATO and overruns West Germany, it is assumed that diplomatic negotiations will then suddenly become advantageous to both sides. For the Soviets, they would be satisfied to end the war with their substantial gains, not to mention the distinction of being regarded by the world as having won the war, especially if a nuclear exchange had not yet occurred. NATO, on the other hand (and especially the French) would want to end the war before the Red Army rolled into France proper, and certainly before a full-blown nuclear war erupted (or escalated further, if a limited nuclear exchange had already occurred).&#10;&#10;On the other side of the coin, if the Red Army&rsquo;s drive into West Germany is halted or thrown back, the war will have run its course then and there, regardless of what is happening elsewhere in the world. Negotiations would be underway, regardless, but the Soviets would have very little to gain (and actually much to lose) by perpetuating a war that is then being perceived as the ultimate reproach of the Soviet state and Communist ideology. Indeed, before Soviet battlefield defeats became prolific and pronounced, and especially before NATO units began to push across the borders of East Bloc countries, the Soviets would be confronted with a choice of trying to negotiate an end to the war before the Warsaw Pact alliance collapsed (or worse, defected&hellip;as if a widespread repeat of the Hungarian Uprising of &lsquo;56), or resort to nuclear strikes to avoid a total defeat (a decidedly undesirable solution when considering NATO&rsquo;s predictable response).&#10;&#10;In any case, Red Tide West presumes a short war whereby the final dispositions will be known within a matter of weeks. The Soviet timetables expected the Red Army to reach the French border within 15 days, and therefore the game excludes Soviet &ldquo;Category C&rdquo; and &ldquo;Category D&rdquo; reserves, which could not have been mobilized within the timeframe of the game&hellip; whether or not the Soviet timetables were realistic in the first place.&#10;&#10;The game includes two maps (22&quot;x34&rdquo;) and 560 counters.&#10;&#10;Design &amp; Development: Eric R.

        "description": "Visegrad 4: The Coming War in Eastern Europe covers a hypothetical conflict between the forces of the Eastern NATO and Russia. With the US in retreat in the world, and the Russians getting overly aggressive, it could be that a resurgent Russia could make an attempt to take back its classic sphere of influence. This, factored in with the fact that Russia is the primary energy source for much of Europe, has made them overly powerful. The biggest threat to the Russian energy dominance is amazingly the country of Poland. Recent technological breakthrough in &lsquo;Fracking&rsquo; has made the Polish shale resources the number one competitor to Russian energy domination. So, once again, the two nations may well be on a collision course to destiny.&#10;&#10;The other assumption made for the background of the game is that Germany, caught in the grips of an isolationist government, and not willing to risk rocking the boat with its primary source of energy, declares Poland the aggressor and that it will be neutral in the NATO &ldquo;violation&rdquo;. The US, already weakened from its own internal problems, is unable to force them to honor their commitments. The resulting chaos and confusion will delay the entry of much of the NATO forces and force Poland and its neighbors to go it alone.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 1 week&#10;Hex: 35 miles / 56 kilometers&#10;Units: Brigades or equivalent&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color map&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (176 5/8&quot; counters - 128 for this game, 48 for Red Dragon / Green Crescent published in Modern War Magazine #1).&#10;One 16-page Visegrad 4 rulebook&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 4-10 hours&#10;&#10;Note: Players will need to provide one 6-sided die for game play.&#10;&#10;",

This campaign saw major offensives by both sides, with considerable intervention by the armed forces of Cuba and South Africa. Among other things, Angola saw some of the biggest armored actions of the Cold War.&#10;&#10;The game is operational level. Each player commands the forces of several different factions, each faction representing a major entity in this particular conflict whose goal was to gain control of as much of Angola as possible while inflicting decisive losses on the enemy. Command control is a critical factor, and the game uses a variant of the &ldquo;Boots&rdquo; system to model this.&#10;&#10;Each game turn represents about one month of operations. The map features all of Angola and the adjoining border regions of Southwest Africa and Zaire. The map scale is approximately 31 miles (50 kilometers) across each hexagon; each brigade or regiment represents from about 1,000 to 3,000 men, depending on the army. A battalion is 300-900 men, whereas a cadre represents small teams of soldiers.&#10;&#10;Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 228 counters&#10;&#10;",

The map covers all of the ostensibly neutral Indian Territory, plus part of the neighboring Union and Confederate states. The playing area has spaces in lieu of hexes; each space is classified according to its dominant terrain which affects movement, combat, and supply. Some of the 204 counters represent the infantry and cavalry regiments and artillery batteries used by each player to create forces on the map. Each turn represents six months of real time.&#10;&#10;The action is driven by players alternately drawing campaign markers. Most markers enable the drawing player to conduct one or more operations, one operation being (1) moving and fighting with one force, (2) recruiting a unit, or (3) building a fort. Other markers allow the drawing player to control the &quot;wild&quot; Kiowa and Comanche Indians raiding from the west; they represent a danger to both sides and control switches back and forth as the control markers are drawn. The length of a turn is variable and unknown to either player; it ends after two &quot;End&quot; markers have been drawn fromt he campaign marker pool.&#10;&#10;Victory is determined by control of the &quot;capital cities&quot; of the Five Civilized Tribes, but the game can end in sudden death if either player loses one of his primary bases. Each player is forced to balance active operations with force-building, concentration for offensives with dispersion to guard his territory, and careful planning with quick reaction to events.&#10;&#10;Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 228 counters&#10;&#10;",

Maybe it's your first time in this tropical paradise. Perhaps you are a veteran of the sun and sea, either way none of you expected to be trapped here.  Dr. McRaph's keys have been stolen, the food supply is dwindling and if you don't get off the island in a few days everyone is going to starve.&#10;&#10;With the key held tight in their grasp, the guilty party watches everyone descend into fits of rage and paranoia.  This is the moment they have been waiting for, a chance to break the taboo without a single witness left to tell the tale.  It is now time for the meat feast!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;In Hannibal Island everyone adopts the secret role of a over-privileged holiday goer or perhaps Dr. McRaph himself.  One player is dealt the role of the Cannibal  it is their aim to murder/eat everyone on the island, while it is everyone else&rsquo;s aim to survive and lynch the cannibal before he/she eats them all.&#10;&#10;Hannibal Island is a Mafia/Werewolf variant.  Unlike Mafia, the Cannibal does not have to kill every turn and the time limit is set by the dwindling food supply.  Each character has an appetite (how much food they need in a day) and a health value (how many days they can not meet their appetite value before dying) Once players get used to the game extra cards/roles can be added to vary the game play and add more strategy, victory conditions and most importantly fun!&#10;&#10;The game is designed to work with up to seven players without a moderator or judge, if you have an honest gaming group. With more players the game still requires a judge to assist with the flow of the game.&#10;&#10;",

You see, the King loves castles, having built Neuschwanstein (the castle that inspired the Disney theme park castles) and others, but now he's commissioned you to build the biggest, best castle ever &mdash; subject, of course, to his ever-changing whims. Each player acts as a building contractor who is adding rooms to the castle he's building while also selling his services to other players.&#10;&#10;In the game, each player starts with a simple foyer. One player takes on the role of the Master Builder, and that player sets prices for a set of rooms that can be purchased by the other players, with him getting to pick from the leftovers after the other players have paid him for their rooms. When a room is added to a castle, the player who built it gains castle points based on the size and type of room constructed, as well as bonus points based on the location of the room. When a room is completed, with all entranceways leading to other rooms in the castle, the player receives one of seven special rewards.&#10;&#10;After each purchasing round, a new player becomes the Master Builder who sets prices for a new set of rooms. After several rounds, the game ends, then additional points are awarded for achieving bonus goals, having the most popular rooms, and being the most responsive to the King's demands, which change each game. Whoever ends up with the most castle points wins.&#10;&#10;",

The Duke has put out a 2 billion cash reward to the person who can take control and unite the gangs of the capital.&#10;&#10;Whether you are are a local gang lord, a wealthy businessman or a local burger van guy that thinks he has what it takes, this is an opportunity that cannot be missed.  Start recruiting from the local thuggery and make a name for yourself launching war on this treacherous turf!&#10;&#10;Treacherous Turf is a card drafting combat game for 2 players.  Each player draws a hand of seven cards, takes one and passes it on to the other player, until each player has a new hand of seven cards. Players then take turns to place these cards one at a time simultaneously onto one of three arenas. Once all seven cards have been played each arena is totaled, whoever has the most points on their side of the arena gets 1 point.  After each arena has been totaled, the deck is shuffled and the drafting starts afresh.  Play continues until one player reaches 5 points. If two players hit 5 points at the same time, another round continues until one player has more points than the other, revealing a clear winner.&#10;&#10;",

Two coaches lead six players from their respective guilds in a race to 12 points--gaining 4 points for scoring a goal, 2 points for taking out a regular player, and 1 point for taking out a mascot (yes, one of the six players on each team is a mascot). During each turn, coaches alternate activating one player at a time. With a small number of models per side, Guild Ball delivers great depth of strategy, balancing ball control, attack, and defense.&#10;&#10;The strategy in Guild Ball continues with the playbook system. Attacks are resolved by rolling dice against the target's defenses, but dice alone do not dictate the results of attacks. Coaches choose the results of attacks from their players' playbooks: the more successful hits an attack roll generates, the more options from the playbook the coach is able to choose from. Possible results include damage, tackles, knock-downs, pushes, dodges, and powerful character plays that can change the course of the game.&#10;&#10;Guild Ball is also a game of resource management: coaches must manage influence and momentum. Teams start each turn with a pool of influence. In order for a player to attack, kick the ball, or perform a character play, the player needs influence. Coaches allocate influence to players at the start of the turn, so careful planning is required. Momentum is generated by special playbook results and successful passes. Momentum allows a coach to perform special actions, such as taking shots on goal, healing damage, or making out-of-activation dodges. Momentum remaining at the end of a turn also affects the initiative roll for the next turn.&#10;&#10;Featuring 11 unique guilds, each with at least 12 players--and more guilds to be released--Guild Ball allows coaches to choose their own play style.&#10;&#10;",

Play as Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf the Grey, Thorin Oakenshield, or others. Your Hero card will guide your strategy throughout the game, or you can break away with a plan of your own.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with his own basic ten-card deck and draws a hand of five cards each turn. Power is the currency you will use to buy new, stronger cards to add to your deck. The goal of a deck-building game is to craft your personal deck into a well-oiled machine, and five types of cards can be acquired: Enemies, Allies, Artifacts, Maneuvers, and Locations. A large, central stack of cards supplies a five-card &quot;Path&quot; from which players make their purchases. Each player always has five face-up cards from which to choose each turn, so new options and surprises await each turn.&#10;&#10;When you have amassed enough Power, you can take on an Archenemy! Each Archenemy has Loot cards you can acquire. Defeat a Troll and you might find Sting, Orcrist, or Glamdring! Take on The Goblin King and you might find the maneuvers you need to escape from the Misty Mountains. Azog is the final Archenemy, and he has unfinished business...&#10;&#10;In the end, the player who has accumulated the most Victory Points from the cards in his deck wins.&#10;&#10;Cryptozoic's The Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit deck-builder series:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring Deck-Building Game&#10;     The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers Deck-Building Game&#10;     The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King Deck-Building Game&#10;     The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey Deck-Building Game&#10;     The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug Deck-Building Game Expansion Pack&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The North American edition of Cheesonomics features cheese from Wisconsin, California, New York, Oregon and Canada.&#10;&#10;The overall goal of Cheesonomics is to manage your cheese supply, churn the right colors or animal types from your opponents' hands, produce the market's most demanded colors of cheese to milk the most profit, and earn the most curd cash by selling different colors of cheese at high market prices.&#10;&#10;Cheesonomics can be played at three different skill levels - mild, sharp and extra sharp - allowing gamers to adjust the game according to their own playing palate.&#10;&#10;Each game starts with three market wheels made up of 5 market wedges, and each player receives five cheese wedges and a cheese knife marked with either cheddar, edam, feta, gouda or parmesan.&#10;&#10;On each turn, the active player begins by retrieving his cheese knife from the serving tray - if it was placed there on a previous turn - and then chooses one of three different culinary actions: Churn Cheese, Produce Cheese or Sell Cheese.&#10;&#10;Churning cheese allows a player to collect cheese wedges from opponents. When churning, the active player asks for one color or animal type. The colors are red, orange, yellow, green or blue, and animals are cow, sheep, goat, yak, and reindeer. If an opponent has that type of cheese card, he must give the active player one card of that type. If he does not have that card type, the opponent must show his hand and give the active player one wedge of the active player's choice.&#10;&#10;The active player then protects his product by placing his cheese knife over that color or animal type on the provided serving tray. No other player can churn for that type of cheese until the knife is removed on that player's next turn.&#10;&#10;Instead of Churning, a player could Produce cheese.  To do this, the active player simply plays all cheese wedges of one color or animal type from his hand face up onto the table into a cheese wheel. These wedges will be available for sale in future turns. The player then draws cheese wedges until he has five total wedges in his hand.&#10;&#10;Instead of Churning or Producing cheese, the active player could Sell Cheese. To sell, a player chooses up to three wedges of one color or animal type from previously-formed cheese and gains curd cash depending on the market, which is the sum of face-up, matching color market wedges.&#10;&#10;After selling cheese, the active player now &quot;Mooves&quot; the market, choosing one market wedge representing the color of the cheese sold in the transaction and flipping that wedge to the opposite side.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the cheese wedge draw pile is exhausted during a player's turn. The cheesemonger who has the most curd cash is the cheesy champion!&#10;&#10;Cheesonomics has even more to offer players who wish to try out the Sharp and Extra Sharp flavors of the game.&#10;&#10;In the Sharp game, players can now further manipulate the market. Whenever a Sell Cheese action is taken, that player now also chooses a wedge in the market to completely replace with one from his personal supply of market wedges.&#10;&#10;There are also certain cheese wedges with market symbols that may be activated during a Sell Cheese action that can allow a player to discard one of their market wedges and gain another or give a market wedge to one of the other players and take one of theirs.&#10;&#10;The Extra Sharp game is for the truly adventurous Cheeseheads!  As an expansion to Cheesonomics, players can add in the Extra Sharp cheese wedge cards that introduce growth hormone, organic and smelly cheese wedges. Each of these new cheese wedge types have special rules that affect a Sell Cheese action, allowing players the choice to boost their production with growth hormones, earn more curds at game end with quality organic cheeses, or use pungent aromas to prevent players from flipping or removing market wedges.&#10;&#10;",

Players manage resources, build bases, recruit armies, and engage in strategic combat similar to an RTS video game!  Eternity Wars was developed with an intent to port the same mechanics that make RTS games so enjoyable onto a table top setting.  Veteran RTS players will recognize the Tech Trees, different resources, required micro and macro management, and unit types that are staples in the RTS genre.  Although the game functions very similarly to the video game variant, it includes many new and original mechanics that make playing Eternity Wars a unique and fulfilling experience.&#10;&#10;The game has two expansions, the Covenant of Necromancers Expansion Set and the Great Animal Kingdom Expansion Set.&#10;&#10;After running a Kickstarter campaign that failed to fund, only 20 units were ever produced.&#10;&#10;",

One day, a petty argument boiled over to a fight, and once the fight grew to the point that the royal guards had to be called in, there was no way to contain the situation. It was going to be Kune v Lakia!&#10;&#10;&#10;KUNE v LAKIA: A Chronicle Of A Royal Lapine Divorce Foretold is a game for two players, each acting for the Duke or the Princess during the divorce proceedings.&#10;&#10;A starting hand of five assets (manors, jewelry and abundant wealth) is drawn, and the players use those assets to influence members of the royal lapine court (the abbot, the sorceress, the duke's sister, the king, and the knight). The favors gained and plots hatched are represented by cards added to each player's deck. These cards can be used to further influence courtiers, hide property, and hinder the opponent's ability to do the same.&#10;&#10;Much like in a real-life divorce, this is a highly interactive process, and not an easy one at that. In a game of behind-the-scenes plotting and intrigue, only the most clever player will emerge victorious in the struggle for prestige, property and power!&#10;&#10;",

Youngest player goes first and play proceeds clockwise.&#10;&#10;Players take turns revealing cards from their stacks in a forward motion.  When a card is revealed, the players vie to slap the corresponding Care Bear card in the center of the table.  Whoever does so first claims the card they slapped.  If two players slap at the same time, whoever covers more of the card with their hand claims the card.  The claimed card is replaced by the one that was revealed.&#10;&#10;The first player to collect cards that spell BEAR wins (i.e., a set of the four different Care Bear cards).  For a more challenging game, the rules recommend a variant where incorrect slaps result in the player losing a previously collected card.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Introduction&#10;&#10;Spar is a popular game from Ghana. It is a trick-taking game without trumps, in which the object is to win the last trick.&#10;&#10;Spar is usually played by 2, 3 or 4 players, but it is possible for up to 7 to play. The game uses 35 cards from a standard international 52-card pack, the cards of each suit ranking from high to low: A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, but the Ace of Spades is normally not used, so the highest card in that suit is the King.&#10;&#10;Play&#10;&#10;Whoever played the highest card of the suit that the first player led is the winner of the trick. The cards played are not gathered in but remain in a face up pile. The winner of the trick leads any card from hand to begin the next trick, playing it face up on top of the pile, and once again the other players must each play a card: this must be the same suit as the card that was led if possible, otherwise any card.&#10;&#10;This continues until five tricks have been played.&#10;&#10;Scoring&#10;&#10;Whoever wins the fifth and last trick wins the hand and scores:&#10;&#10;3 points if the winning card is a 6;&#10;    2 points if the winning card is a 7;&#10;    1 point for winning with any other card - 8 or higher.&#10;&#10;The winner of the hand deals the next hand, and therefore plays last to the first trick of the next hand. The session continues for as long as the players wish - there is no fixed number of deals or target score that ends the session.&#10;&#10;Variations&#10;&#10;Two other versions of this game exists: Jeu de Carte, which is played in Benin, and Sipa, a game played in Togo. Both share similar rules however.&#10;&#10;Jeu de Carte&#10;&#10;It is played with 31 cards (all the cards from Ace down to Seven except the Ace of Spades).&#10;&#10;Players play their cards in front of them, rather than in a single pile in the centre. A player who is unable to follow suit to a trick plays his card face down.&#10;&#10;The score is 1 point for winning the last trick, or 2 if it is won with a Seven.&#10;&#10;The game is played until an agreed number of points is gained, often 24.&#10;  &#10;Sipa&#10;&#10;The rules are identical to Jeu de Carte with the exception of Scoring:&#10;Whoever wins the fifth and last trick wins the hand and scores:&#10;&#10;6 points if the winning player wins the last three tricks with 7&rsquo;s&#10;    4 points if the winning player wins the last two tricks with 7&rsquo;s&#10;    2 points if the winning card is a 7;&#10;    1 point for winning the last trick with any other card - 8 or higher.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player who is the first to score 10 or more points - or the players may agree on some other target score, such as 6, 12 or 24 points.&#10;&#10;",

Players can bet on any of these points: if the other players concede, the bettor automatically wins the point; if they contest the point its value is increased.&#10;&#10;At the end of the play, the score for each player is calculated and added to their previous cumulative total:&#10;&#10;For winning a figure on which there was no bet - 1 point&#10;    For betting a figure which everyone calls good - 1 point&#10;    For winning a figure which was bet and hold, but to which no one said three - 2 points&#10;    For saying three to a figure which was bet and held, if everone says good to the three - 2 points&#10;    For winning a figure on which a raise to three was held - 3 points.&#10;&#10;A player who held the Weli but fails to score for any of the five figures loses one point.&#10;&#10;Everyone's score starts from zero, and the game ends when any player's score reaches or exceeds an agreed target score.&#10;&#10;",

Along the way you can sabotage their efforts with cannon fire, a bout of scurvy or incite mutiny in their midst! Convince more pirates to join your crew with spiced rum and treasure.

If you have an abundance of Swabbies mopping the decks but not enough Gunners to man the cannons you can trade them across to a rival crew for someone more worthy of your ship.

Set the totem in the middle of the playing area. Players take turns flipping one card at a time from their personal deck onto a personal discard deck. If two face-up cards show the same symbol, the players of those cards race to grab the totem, with the first grabber giving his stack of face-up cards to the slowpoke. Special cards mix up who should be grabbing what when to keep players on their toes. Whoever runs out of cards first wins!&#10;&#10;Jungle Speed: 20 Years comes packaged in a special golden case with a golden-backed version of the original card deck as well as a new card deck and a wooden totem.&#10;&#10;",

You can give to more than 3 people, but you should be included.&#10;If a special card(Pirate or Treasure Box) appears during you are giving cards, your turn ends immediately. Pirate takes your treasure token and Treasure Box gives you the tokens taken.&#10;&#10;[Game Ends]&#10;The round ends when 4 pieces apper among the 5 special cards, and the player who has the most Golds gets treasure tokens. The game ends after 3 rounds.&#10;Compare each other's treasure tokens, and decide the winner.&#10;&#10;",

The player who gets highest score wins.&#10;&#10;[Game Play]&#10;ASRUS: Zodiac is a &lsquo;simultaneous action&rsquo; game, so there is no order to play. In each turn, every players play a card from hands. You should play face down not to show to others. After all players have played, open the cards at the same time.&#10;1. Make the closest distance!&#10;Only one player can get stars(cards = points). For this, you need to approach to the destination as close as possible. Basically who makes the closest distance will get stars - &lsquo;Distance&rsquo; means the&#10;gap(absolute value) between the number of your card and the destination.&#10;2. Avoid collisions!&#10;But notice, you should avoid the collision with other spaceships! Even though the closest distance, if several players have made same distances, they all collide.&#10;&#10;[Game Ends &amp; Scoring]&#10;After several turns, when you used up all cards in hands, the game ends. Scoring is as below, and the player who gets highest score wins.&#10;1. 1 point per a constellation card you acquired.&#10;&#10;+  1 bonus point per a set of 4 colors (red, blue, green, and brown)&#10;&#10;2. 2 points to the player who has the most energy (if tie, 1 point to each.)&#10;3. Bonus points to the player who has the great explorer prize&#10;But! The player whose spaceship has no energy cannot return from the exploration. 0 points!&#10;&#10;&#10;    This game is second edition of ASRUS, it has the same basic system with ASRUS but there are spaceships and no glass stones - a little more strategic.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

She will get angry and not give yummy supper if the brothers are too late. Therefore, go home before she puts away food! Of course, the frogs have to eat flies enough on the load. Eating is our instinct. ;)&#10;&#10;[Goal]&#10;Despite of mom's call, it's more important to eat flies than go home. Because we are tree frogs! But if you are too late, you'll get a scolding from mom. So be careful. Eat flies as many as possible and escape penalty points, and then win this game between brothers.&#10;&#10;[Play - Brief Rules]&#10;This is a dexterity game by flipping the paper(origami) frog.&#10;On the game board, there are circle target and moving track. Each round the players flip own frog to the target, and move his tokens on the track according to the result of the target. Players should compete with each other to get more stone tiles which have points on the track. For this, flipping the frog to proper target area is very important. But it won&rsquo;t be easy because the terrible event cards are opened frequently. Flip and go, and eat flies(points)!&#10;&#10;[Game Ends &amp; Scoring]&#10;Game ends when one of the following situations is happened.&#10;1. When any player's game token arrives at a home(Mom) space on the track. &#10;2. When 'Mom card' is opened from Event Card deck.&#10;In these cases, immediately game is over without the next round.&#10;Scores are as follow: Fly points + 1.Home bonus points - 2.Penalty points for late (Depend on the above end situations.)&#10;&#10;",

Preceded by a devastating orbital attack, a warlike alien race known as the Hydra has besieged the planet, their invasion force carried on enormous drop ships that dwarf city blocks and rain devastation from above. The Hydra&rsquo;s ultimate goal is to eradicate the last survivors of their ancient nemesis, the Ghin, an alien race that has taken refuge on Earth. Humanity is caught in the apocalyptic crossfire. As widespread panic grips the populace, governments topple, economies crumble, and order dissolves. In these desperate days, mankind&rsquo;s only hope lies with the Ghin and one of their most brilliant minds: Dr. Cronos, a being as guilty of atrocities against humanity as those who hunt him.&#10;&#10;LEVEL 7 [INVASION] is a standalone semi-cooperative game of global strategy set in the LEVEL 7 universe that follows the events of LEVEL 7 [ESCAPE], LEVEL 7 [ESCAPE]: Lockdown, and LEVEL 7 [OMEGA PROTOCOL]. As the planet is battered by the Hydra's relentless assault, you'll control Earth's desperation-forged coalitions in an effort to turn back the invasion. But soldiers aren't enough. You and your allies must manage your resources carefully to combat the threats of hysteria, famine, and population loss as well. Endure long enough, and you might buy the time for Dr. Cronos to develop the advanced weaponry required to defeat the invading Hydra. The survival of the human race depends on your next move!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "bit Crawl Portable is the &quot;take with you&quot; version of Super Turbo bit Crawl FX: Alpha Xtreme, packing the punch of the full-size game in a smaller package.&#10;&#10;bCP is a rogue-like dungeon crawler with the feel of a classic console RPG. Players select their hero, their special ability, and a boss that they will fight at the end of the game. Then players navigate the dungeon, fighting any monsters in their way, collecting treasure, and dealing with any events that might crop up along the way until the boss fight is triggered.&#10;&#10;bCP is a co-op game with a competitive element. Players will find it difficult to navigate the dungeon alone but will be collecting treasures of varying value along the way, the choice on whether to share these with their party or hoard them for their own benefit at the end of the game is theirs alone. The person with the highest value of treasure when the boss is defeated or the heroes die at the hands of the boss is the winner.&#10;&#10;bCP uses custom dice to resolve combat, trigger special abilities, and seed the dungeon. The game is played out through a series of rounds in which the players each take a turn consisting of two actions then the monsters take a turn fending off the heroes advances. This continues until the boss fight is triggered by a card located in the monster deck, at which time all heroes are warped to the room that the boss appears and fight desperately to best the boss of the dungeon.&#10;&#10;With the varying player abilities and the random dungeon seeds bCP will not play the same way twice. Unlike other dungeon crawlers, bCP will not require a DM to guide the party along the way.&#10;&#10;",

The expansion was added at the time that Chessex acquired Nova's inventory. Dennis Greci estimated that there were approximately 500 of these sets.&#10;&#10;A brief review of the Expansion Set shows that it is a &quot;must have&quot; for Wingleader players, if only for the twelve new aircraft cards (which add another 24 aircraft to the game.) Also included are campaign game rules, designed by Alfred Leonardi and Greci, which allow for large scale tournament games. There are also two suggested Speed Bonus rules for dealing with combat between aircraft of varying maximum airspeeds.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

You have a mission to accomplish and you would like to avoid being killed while doing it. And you want your side to win, of course. But who, exactly, is on your side?&#10;&#10;Tradecraft is a hidden role card game where 3-6 players take on the roles of either Soviet or American spies during the Cold War era. Rather than using social deduction, players will have to carefully watch to see which cards are drafted and how they are played to decipher friend from foe. Players may never willingly show their role to another player, but may say whatever they want about it, even the truth if necessary. The game is played over the course of several rounds and can usually be finished in less than 30 minutes.&#10;&#10;Each round has 3 phases:&#10;&#10;1. Deal Cards - Roles and tradecraft cards will be shuffled and dealt randomly.  &#10;2. Choose Cards - Players will pass a portion of their cards to the left 3 times to draft the cards they want.  &#10;3. Play Cards - Cards are then executed in descending order, information flows, and bullets fly.&#10;&#10;Scoring is based on the side winning the round (1 point) and completing a public or secret missions (usually 1 or 2 points).&#10;&#10;",

You play a noble from one of the four great houses that jockey to succeed him. However, three powerful guilds each see a chance to build a new era. Many of the nobles hold secret positions within those guilds. These allegiances no doubt provide lucrative opportunities. The question to be answered is: will the nobles put family first, or strike out to make their own futures?&#10;&#10;In this game, you play a noble with two conflicting allegiances: to your house and to your guild. Can you cooperate with either team long enough to secure victory?&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Grand-Prix Elite  is a game about Formula 1 races (11 pages of rules).&#10;&#10;The first car to pass through the finish line after 2 or 3 laps is the winner.&#10;&#10;Grand-Prix Elite is played on tracks (size of gameboard = 40 cm by 60 cm, roughly). Tracks contains two types of spaces : straight section, or curve. The average length of a lap is between 40 spaces (fast tracks) and 60 spaces (long tracks). For the moment, there are 9 tracks : Monaco, Canada, Belgium, Japan, Italy, Catalunya, Singapore, China, Le mans.&#10;&#10;Grand-prix Elite uses plastic racing cars (dimension = 27 mm long).&#10;Six-sided dice are used for Wear tests, Skid tests, etc...&#10;Optional rules include weather variation and Event cards.&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY : each player has a certain number of Speed cards. In order to move his car he plays 1 Speed card. &#10;Then the Speed card goes to his dashboard : this is now the current speed of the car. &#10;Each turn, the player can increase or decrease this speed by 1 level. &#10;Also, extra movements are given by a Tyre-Setup card located in the dashboard. The Tyre-Setup card represents the strategy chosen for the car (soft, hard or rain tyres, aero grip, suspension, etc..)&#10;Once moved, a car can engage another car in order to gain its position.&#10;&#10;Each player faces 3 challenges in this game :&#10;a) Damages. The number of Speed cards owned by the player is also the number of damages his car can absorb without consequences. Powerful Speed cards often leads to damages (due to engine wear or dangerous curve)...Some cars are fast but fragiles, so pit stops will be necessary in this case.&#10;b) Curves. Each curve has an optimal speed. If a car's speed exceeds the optimal speed while taking the curve, the car can goes off track (and possibly taking damages). &#10;However, a driver has 3 choices when his car is about to take a curve : short, medium, or long trajectory. With a short trajectory, you go faster, but it's risky. With a long trajectory, you take the curve more easily, but you become an easy prey if engaged by opponents...&#10;Here, tyre and set-up strategies are very important things for purpose of taking a curve.&#10;c) Ghost cars. In addition to his normal car, each player controls one or several Ghost cars. Ghost cars follow their own rules, and symbolize the bulk of lapped cars driven by anonymous drivers. Their purpose is to annoy other players.&#10;&#10;",

At the start of each hand, the dealer deals 10 cards from the Shot Deck to each player and flips over the top two cards of the Target Deck.&#10;&#10;Each Target is worth a number of points and players take turns playing a Shot card on each. The team that plays the highest valued Shot will win the Target and score the points, but you must play carefully, because shooting the wildlife might lose you points!&#10;&#10;In addition, if a team wins both Targets, they might receive bonus points. A hand lasts five rounds; then points are tallied and recorded, and the deal passes to the left. Play continues in this fashion until one team scores a set number of points.&#10;&#10;",

Every game is played over a series of rounds, as you and your opponents play character cards in an attempt to claim the Iron Throne for yourselves.&#10;&#10;In each round, you pursue your own plans and seek to foil your opponents by playing character cards. Each turn, you will play a character card from your hand, adding to the court at King&rsquo;s Landing. You can advance your own prospects by playing your character cards cleverly, but certain rules govern exactly where you can place your character cards.&#10;&#10;The first character cards must be played in a single row, forming the bottom row of the court. Once there are two cards in a row, you may play a card in a new row above them. The card that you play in the new row, however, must match the House of one of the two cards below it. In Game of Thrones: Westeros Intrigue, character cards are divided between House Stark, House Lannister, House Baratheon, and House Targaryen, and each player may have character cards from any of these Houses in his hand.&#10;&#10;The court develops as you and your opponents play cards, but a player will eventually discover that he can no longer legally play a character card. Once this occurs, that player is eliminated and the round continues. A round ends when no one can play another character card, and whoever played the last character card wins the round. In Game of Thrones: Westeros Intrigue, you will play rounds equal to the number of players.&#10;&#10;If you win a round of Game of Thrones: Westeros Intrigue, you reap the rewards by drawing an Iron Throne card, which cancels a number of your penalty points. Your opponents, on the other hand, must take penalty points equal to the number of character cards that they have left in their hand. Over the course of the game, players gain penalty points from having character cards at the end of the round, and reduce their penalty points by winning a round and drawing an Iron Throne card. At the end of the game, the player with the least penalty points wins!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Age of War is a quick-playing game of conquest. Fourteen cards are laid out at the start of the game, each showing one castle and the symbols required to conquer this castle, with the symbols separated into battle lines. Each castle belongs to a clan, with some clans having only a single castle and some having up to four castles.&#10;&#10;A player starts his turn by rolling seven dice, the six sides of which show archery, cavalry, daimyo, and 1-3 infantry. He then selects a card and uses the symbols rolled to conquer exactly one of the battle lines on this card (by placing the appropriate dice on that line). If he can do this, he then rolls the remaining dice, ideally conquering another line; if he can't conquer a line, he removes one die from play, then rolls again. His turn ends when either he conquers every line on the card (in which case he claims it) or he no longer has dice available to roll.&#10;&#10;Each card is worth a number of victory points. You can conquer cards owned by other players, but you need to conquer an additional daimyo line in the process. If a player owns all the castles of one clan, however, those castles are secure and cannot be stolen. What's more, these castles are now worth more points because you've united the clan under one ruler (you) and strengthened your hold over Japan.&#10;&#10;When the last card is claimed, players tally their points, and whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Ching Gong for Four is a Halma variant for two, three or four players on a unique star-shaped board with eight points.  The board is comprised of 133 dots connected by lines, with 11 dots on each corner and 45 in the center of the board.  The eight star points are in four colors, each color matching the star point on the opposite side of the board.  The players' pieces begin on a star point of the same color, and the objective is to be the first to move all of a player's pieces to the opposite star point and win the game.&#10;&#10;Rules for movement are the same as for Halma and Chinese Checkers, meaning that players take turns moving one piece at a time in any direction, and that players may jump their own or other players' pieces.  Pieces are not removed from the board.  The pieces must move only along the lines connecting the dots on the board however, and Ching Gong for Four's board is unusual in this regard.  Not only does it have eight points or corners instead of four or six, but not every dot is connected to the other.  Half the dots are connected to eight surround dots, the other half only four surrounding dots.&#10;&#10;This game is not to be confused with another game from the same publisher, Ching Gong for Two, which is played on a standard Chinese Checkers board and has three colors of pieces.&#10;&#10;",

The variety comes from the synergies between the trait cards and from the different personalities at the table.  Some players thrive on creating Carnivores to wreak havoc on their fellow players.  Others prefer to stay protected and mind their own business.  Evolution encourages both play styles by giving each of them multiple paths to victory.  And it is the mix of play styles at the table that ultimately determines the ecosystem in which the players are adapting.  So gather your friends and see who can best adapt to the changing world around them.&#10;&#10;&quot;The theme of evolution is not just tacked on: it drives play.&quot; - Nature (the world's most prestigious scientific journal)  &#10;Evolution was covered in the journal Nature.  The article was written by Stuart West, a Professor of Evolutionary Biology at the University of Oxford who has used Evolution in his undergraduate class.  &#10;&#10;     https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1487263/evolution-and-other-evolution-themed-games-nature&#10;     https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1580710/using-game-evolution-teach-evolution&#10;&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Seven Sleepers can be by played on an ordinary 8x8 square checkerboard, though in its original edition the board had starting positions for its pieces marked on the board.  There are 8 blue pieces for one player, 8 red pieces for the other player, and 7 yellow neutral pieces.&#10;&#10;The game starts with each player's pieces on the row of 8 squares on opposite sides of the board.  The yellow neutral pieces are on the 7 junctions or intersections between squares in the middle of the board.  Players take turns moving one of their pieces at a time, diagonally to an adjacent space, or jumping an opponent's piece to an opposite vacant space.  Opponents' pieces are not captured or removed from the board.&#10;&#10;Players may also move a piece vertically or horizontally, but only to jump an opponent's piece, landing on a vacant space on the other side.  Because of these rules of movement, pieces will be bound to the color of square on which they began play.&#10;&#10;The neutral pieces can be captured (removed from the board) by either player making a single diagonal move over the junction on which the neutral piece rests.  Also, once a piece crosses the center line, it may not cross back to that half of the board.  The player who first moves all of his pieces to his opponent's starting positions and has captured the majority of neutral pieces wins the game. Any other outcome is a draw.&#10;&#10;",

Blue flies count three and common flies are one for a total of 28 points. One team is the flies the other team is the spider. Object of game is to score 15 points. Flies attempt to get into spider's den and score according to their values. Spider seeks to consume flies and keep them out of his den.&#10;&#10;Moves are somewhat like checkers. Spider jumps the flies and removes them from the board. Flies do not jump. Common flies may only move forward or around the circle. Blue flies may move backwards as well.&#10;&#10;Flies start first. The spider may move in a straight line on any of the lines running toward the center as far as he please. He cannot pass over the double circle either going out or coming in without stopping there one move. On all the circles except the double one the spider cannot move any further than the flies can (one space). On the double circle the spider may move 1/4 of the way around at one move. The spider may jump in any direction as many times as his moves entitle him to. He is requited to stop at the next crossing beyond each fly jumped. If several flies are in position with but one crossing between each fly he must jump all such flies (no matter what direction it takes him) stopping at the next crossing beyond the last fly.&#10;&#10;The spider may jump from his den and take any fly on the double circle unless there is another fly in front of or behind it. It also enables him when on the double circle to take a fly standing on the crossing 1/4 the way around if there is no fly on the next crossing beyond and none between. The spider may move clear across the double circle passing through the center on his way and jump a fly on the opposite side of the double circle if there are no intervening flies and none beyond the fly to back him up. The spider may move from the double circle to the outside circle in one move (nothing intervening) but cannot return to the center when outside the double circle without stopping one move on the way at the double circle.&#10;&#10;",

Your Start card determines in which order to build the series: up, down or random. Close a series with a Home card.&#10;You can hit on the last cards in an opponents series using Tease cards as long as that series isn't completed with a Home card.&#10;Jokers can substitute any number card and can be exchanged for the right number in your turn and must be played again in the same turn.&#10;Choice cards make you turn extra cards from the deck (as many as there are players). You get to choose first. Don't forget to end your turn with just 3 cards in hand. The other players have to fullfil that condition at their respective turns.&#10;&#10;",

The harder the question attempted, the more dots the player is entitled to join together on that turn. After joining 25 dots the host sets the first clue to help identify the picture. A second clue was given at 35 dots, and a final clue at 40 dots. These clues should be written by the host and disclosed only to the relevant player.&#10;&#10;A player calls &quot;Dotto&quot; if the picture is recognized at any stage of the game. The answer is given and written to the host, undisclosed to their opponent. More points are awarded for earlier recognition as each unconnected dot earned 5 points. A player must give the name of the picture to the host once all the dots are joined. The host announces whether the guess is correct or not. If correct, the second player has one attempt to guess and so draw the game. If drawn the game is repeated.&#10;&#10;Alternative games can be played such as double Dotto where the value of the dots is doubled. If a player gives an incorrect answer the game is over. The opponent received no points but is victorious and remains to fight a new challenger. Any number of rounds may be played, at the end of which the player with the highest points scored is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "From the Avalanche Press website:&#10;&#10;In early November 1942, American and British forces stormed ashore in French-ruled Morocco and Algeria, beginning a campaign to press the Axis into a small bridgehead around the ports of Tunis and Bizerte in Tunisia. The U.S. Army had its first exposure to combat in the European Theater, while fresh British forces joined the veteran Eighth Army against the Axis. French troops fought first against the Allies, then with them. Inside the shrinking perimeter, German and Italian units continued to offer fierce resistance.&#10;&#10;An Army at Dawn is a complete boxed game in the Panzer Grenadier series based on these battles.  The game includes four semi-rigid mapboards, with art by Guy Riessen. The maps are fully compatible with many others in the Panzer Grenadier series (and those from Panzer Grenadier (Modern) and Infantry Attacks, too).  There are 517 playing pieces: ultra-thick, scorchless, sootless laser-cut. You do not need any other game to play any of its 40 scenarios. Design is by Mike Perryman, creator of Liberation 1944 and Kursk: Burning Tigers among other titles.&#10;&#10;",

Throughout the deck there are 'Burgermeister' cards. When a 'Burgermeister' card is pulled players may choose to sell any of the commodities they have on their llamas for their current point value (determined by the 'Demand' cards). The values of the different commodities change throughout the game.&#10;&#10;During the game, you can play action cards to upgrade your own llamas, or apply negative effects on other players.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the deck runs out of cards. The player with the most money wins.&#10;&#10;&#10;Llamanomics is a card game about supply, demand, and llamas (and the occasional alpaca).&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to get the most valuable commodities and sell them for the most points. &#10; You play as a trader, taking his/her commodities to the market to sell.  And what will be carrying your commodities?  Why, your trusty llamas!  The more llamas you get, the more you can carry.  The more you can form corner the market on different commodities and squeeze out your competition.  Capitalism style!  Llama style!&#10;&#10;So, the strategy comes in with 'ACTION CARDS', which allow you to upgrade your llamas, downgrade your competitors llamas, steal llamas, swap commodities, and all sorts of other shenanigans!&#10;&#10;'DEMAND CARDS' add yet another element of gameplay as the value of the commodities changes throughout the game.&#10;&#10;You have to be clever in placing llamas, commodities and action cards.  You have to be even more clever in choosing which other players you will trade with, or harass, make alliances with, and take the free-llama-market by storm!&#10;&#10;",

At this point the first player who was unable to put down any cards opens up a new pile.&#10;&#10;There are 8 special cards in the deck. 6 closing cards, and 2 switching cards. A closing card allows a player to close any pile of the same color, and open up a new one at any point. The switching cards allows a player to switch the color of a pile with the same background color, and the design of a pile to anything they would like. The next card played after a switch card must still be higher then the number under it.&#10;&#10;",

Players work against one another to be the first to assemble a time machine using turn of the century &quot;Steam Punk&quot; inspired components.&#10;&#10;The first player to assemble their 9-part time machine and end their turn wins the game. However, this is easier said than done. This is the point in the game where the fur really starts to fly! Action cards are played in rapid succession as your opponents attempt to break and disassemble your machine in order to get parts for their own creation. The only way to assure your victory is to employ a multitude of strategies including, hording parts, conserving energy, forming alliances, and, of course, breaking said alliances at the most opportune moment!&#10;&#10;Steampunked Time Machine is a card game with a core set made for 2 players. The game can however be expanded via additional expansion cards and 'booster packs' to play with up to 6 players.&#10;&#10;",

Income is gained by other players visiting their properties and money is spent when they visit properties belonging to other players. When times get tough, players may have to mortgage their properties to raise cash for fines, taxes and other misfortunes.&#10;&#10;Game play&#10;On his turn, a player rolls two dice and moves that number of spaces around the board. If the player lands on an as-yet-unowned property, he has the opportunity to buy it and add it to his portfolio or allow the bank to auction it to the highest bidder. If a player owns all the spaces within a color group, he may then build houses and hotels on these spaces, generating even more income from opponents who land there. If he lands on a property owned by another player, he must pay that player rent according to the value of the land and any buildings on it. There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes, collect income, or even go to jail.&#10;&#10;Goal&#10;The goal of the game is to be the last player remaining with any money.&#10;&#10;",

These tokens show either gold (which possibly gives you points at the end of the game) or an animal (which allows you to pass through gates that bear that animal to reach a different landscape). From the third turn on, players use their animal tokens to move their korrigans and pick up more tokens. Each round the player holding the bag draws a rainbow token and places it in one of the rows or columns on the board; this means that the pot of gold won't appear in this row or column in the final part of the game.&#10;&#10;Once the gold is finally placed on the game board, players have a final round in which they try to reach the pot with their korrigans. If a player reaches the pot with one korrigan, he scores 10 points and if both of his korrigans reach the pot he scores 15 points. Whoever has the highest score wins!&#10;&#10;",

When times get tough, players may have to mortgage their properties to raise cash for fines, taxes and other misfortunes.&#10;&#10;Game play&#10;On his turn, a player rolls two dice and moves that number of spaces around the board. If the player lands on an as-yet-unowned property, he has the opportunity to buy it and add it to his portfolio or allow the bank to auction it to the highest bidder. If a player owns all the spaces within a color group, he may then build houses and hotels on these spaces, generating even more income from opponents who land there. If he lands on a property owned by another player, he must pay that player rent according to the value of the land and any buildings on it. There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes, collect income, or even go to jail.&#10;&#10;Goal&#10;The goal of the game is to be the last player remaining with any money.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Inis is a game deeply rooted in Celtic history and lore in which players win by being elected King of the Island (Inis). Players can try to achieve one of three different victory conditions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Leadership: Be the leader &mdash; i.e., have more clan figures than any other player &mdash; of territories containing at least six opponents' clans.&#10;     Land: Have your clans present in at least six different territories.&#10;     Religion: Have your clans present in territories that collectively contain at least six sanctuaries.&#10;&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, players also earn deeds, typically chanted by bards or engraved by master crafters, that reduce by one the magic total of six for any condition. While one victory condition is enough to claim the title of King, a game of experienced players usually has a tight balance of power, emphasizing the leadership of the capital of the island.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, players draft a hand of four action cards (with 13 action cards for three players and 17 for four players) during the Assembly. Action cards not played at the end of one season are not held for the next. Players also have access to leader cards for the territories that allow it and where they were elected leader during the assembly. Each Assembly reallocates those cards. Finally, they collect &quot;epic tales&quot; cards that depict the deeds of the ancient Irish gods and heroes, like Cuchulainn, the Dagda, Lugh and many others. These will be kept and used to inspire the clans and achieve extraordinary feats...under the right circumstances. The cards provide a variety of actions: adding clans, moving clans, building/exploring, and special actions.&#10;&#10;Careful drafting, hand management, bluffing (especially once players understand the importance of passing their turn), good timing, and a precise understanding of the balance of power are the keys to victory. After a discovery game you'll be ready for a full and epic game, where an undisputed player will be king by the Assembly for his merit and wisdom.&#10;&#10;While Inis has &quot;dudes&quot; that are &quot;on a map&quot;, it's a beginner's mistake to play this as a battle game because eliminating other clans reduces your chances of scoring a Leadership victory condition. Peace among different clans, with or without a clear territory leader, is the usual outcome of a clan's movement. Battles will occur, of course, as the Celtic clans can be unruly and a good player will listen to his clan's people (i.e., his hand of cards). That battle aspect is reflected in the clan's miniatures representing warriors. Woodsmen, shepherds and traders complete the set of twelve minis for each player; these occupations have no impact on the game, but give it flavor.&#10;&#10;",

Players take turns flicking their winks onto the board, trying to land them in the cups.  There are some free turn spaces on the board, and if players land their pieces there, they can take another turn.&#10;&#10;If players miss the cups, they can place an additional piece on the board, and on additional turns, players can either flick their winks or roll a die to move their piece on the board.  When they land their piece on a color that matches their pieces, they can make another attempt to flick a wink into a cup.  If they manage to get their piece to the end of the trail, they place one of their winks into the cup at the end of their trail and take their piece back.&#10;&#10;The cups at the end of the trails are worth 25 points each, while the one that can only be reached by the tiddlywinks is worth 50 points.  The game ends when one player has all four of his winks in the cups, and players total up the points of all their winks.  Whoever has the highest points wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

For the expansion to regular Power Grid see Power Grid: Europe/North America.&#10;&#10;For the 10th anniversary of the highly successful game Power Grid we present this new deluxe version including brand new components. Wait for a huge double-sided game board presenting Europe and North America, newly customized wooden parts and an entire deck of new power plants, some of which use natural gas instead of garbage. New overview cards for the resource refill improve game play. An exciting new two players experience is also added - &ldquo;Against the Trust&rdquo;!&#10;&#10;The game is still Power Grid, with all the exciting auctions, the nerve-wracking resource speculations, city networks and the competition among the players, all the way to the tight game ending with several players fighting for the win.&#10;&#10;The goal of Power Grid Deluxe is to supply the most cities with power when someone's network reaches a predetermined size. Players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection, then bid against each other to purchase the power plants that they need to power these cities. However, as power plants are purchased, newer, more efficient plants become available, so by merely purchasing, you're potentially allowing others access to superior equipment.&#10;&#10;What's more, players must acquire the resources (coal, oil, natural gas, and uranium) needed to power said plants (except for the &quot;renewable&quot; windfarm plants, which require no fuel), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Crane...Claw...Rip-Off...Thief...it is known by many names throughout history, but the infamous game is still the same in concept: insert cash, use a joystick/buttons to move a metal hand or claw mechanism, then press another button to drop it to see if you snag a prize! Sadly, more times than not, that shiny new toy slips out of the fingers, or misses completely, leading the victim to try insert more cash and repeat these steps.&#10;&#10;The Unstable Crane Game is an up to 4-player, simultaneous rendition of this traditional arcade game, where the players each place their &quot;claw tokens&quot; over the various prizes on the table and wait to see if they snag it. Each round, the players flip the top cards of their Player decks, and either get to move their claw, drop their target, or claim their prize according to their card. The first player to achieve a Prize collection worth at least 10 points will be declared the winner! Good luck...&#10;&#10;&#10;    Notes*&#10;&#10;&#10;1. There are 3 kinds of cards in each player's deck for simulating their claw's behavior: &quot;Not Yet&quot; (they still have time and may move their claw over another prize.), &quot;Oops! Unlucky!&quot; (their claw snagged a prize, but dropped it while attempting to lift or carry it.), or &quot;You Got It!&quot;(the player's claw successfully claimed a Prize.)&#10;&#10;2. Multiple players can try for the same prize. However, since the actions determined by each player flipping the card of their Player Deck occur at roughly the same time, should multiple players draw their &quot;You got it&quot; card in the same round and be over the same prize, their claws instead interfere with each other and play resumes as if they'd dropped the prize instead!&#10;&#10;3. &quot;Set collection&quot; is also used lightly in this game. Should a player claim at each 3 prizes that share a type, that player is considered an &quot;enthusiast&quot; and each prize of that type in their collection is worth an additional point.&#10;&#10;",

Well it would be if your opponent wasn't racing to do the exact same thing.

SeaWorld and America's favorite board game come to life to preserve 22 of the most iconic marine animals by investing in their natural habitats.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;On his turn, a player rolls two dice and moves that number of spaces around the board. If the player lands on an as-yet-unowned property, he has the opportunity to buy it and add it to his portfolio or allow the bank to auction it to the highest bidder. If a player owns all the spaces within a color group, he may then build houses and hotels on these spaces, generating even more income from opponents who land there. If he lands on a property owned by another player, he must pay that player rent according to the value of the land and any buildings on it. There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes, collect income, or even go to jail.&#10;&#10;Goal&#10;The goal of the game is to be the last player remaining with any money.&#10;&#10;",

It is a simple wargame involving ants.&#10;&#10;There are two scenarios provided. The scenario for two players has one controlling black ants and the other red ants. The black ant player sends workers out to find breadcrumbs and twigs and return them to the anthill, and sends soldiers out to protect the workers. The red and player has a small number of ants who invade the area and try to capture the workers.&#10;&#10;The black ant player does not know where the breadcrumbs and twigs are, as they are among a bunch of pieces randomly placed face-down on the board at the start of the game. Other pieces are impassable obstacles and an antlion which immediately kills the ant finding it.&#10;&#10;There is also a solitaire scenario in which the player controls the black ants and has to get a certain number of breadcrumbs back to the hill. Making this difficult is Eglantine the praying mantis, who moves around the board randomly and kills any ant it gets near.&#10;&#10;",

Break for lunch at the Sushi Shop, or stop off for a drink at the Pub. Don't forget to check out the Wizard's Traveling Imaginarium before you go! But no matter where you go, keep on the lookout for a bargain... the denizens of this town are always wheeling and dealing! Collect and trade resources as you visit the various buildings of Harbour, and cash them in to buy your way into the town. Whoever has the most points worth of buildings when the game ends, wins!&#10;&#10;Harbour is a worker placement game where players move their worker from building to building, collecting and trading Fish, Livestock, Wood, and Stone; and cashing those resources in to purchase buildings (which are the worker placement spots) from the central pool. Once a building is purchased, it is replaced from the deck, and the central pool is a small subset of the deck, and is therefore different every game.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player has purchased his fourth building. After that round finishes, the player with the most points worth of buildings is the winner!&#10;&#10;At the heart of Harbour is a dynamic market mechanism. Each time a player purchases a building, the value of the resources they used drops, while the value of the other resources rise. You'll have to carefully time your purchases to take advantage of the ebb and flow of market prices, or be prepared to waste some resources!&#10;&#10;",

Earn the heart of these fuzzy critters to win and maybe snatch your friends' along the way!&#10;&#10;All Bunnies Eat Carrots, nicknamed ABEC, is quick to learn and easy to play. Players gather items, find bunnies, and initiate actions using the cards they&rsquo;ve been dealt. There are 11 bunnies to find and collect and each has its own needs and difficulty level. The higher the point value of the bunny the more difficult it is to collect it! Players only need to collect three bunnies to finish the game and the player with the highest combined value of bunnies wins! Simply put, collect the bunnies&rsquo; needs, the first player to collect three bunnies ends the game, and the player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;Each player starts with 5 cards. On their turn they may either draw three cards from the deck or look at the top three cards of the discard pile and pick one card. They may play as many cards as the wish during their turn. This includes playing bunnies in front of them to begin collecting. Every bunny has four unique needs that a player must obtain to collect the bunny. Once all the items have been gathered the bunny is finished collecting and is the player&rsquo;s for the rest of the game!&#10;&#10;The game also has action cards to help players develop strategies to give them the upper hand!&#10;&#10;",

Finally, impose yourself as the only one able to rule the Abyssal people!&#10;&#10;Abyss is a game of development, combination and collection in which players try to take control of strategic locations in an underwater city. To achieve this, players must develop on three levels: first by collecting allies, then using them to recruit Lords of the Abyss, who will then grant access to different parts of the city. Players acquire cards through a draft of sorts, and the Lords of the Abyss acquired on those cards grant special powers to the cardholder &mdash; but once you use the cards to acquire a location, that power is shut off, so players need to time their land grabs well in order to put themselves in the best position for when the game ends.&#10;&#10;",

Play a disaster.&#10;2. Move some cubes around.&#10;3. Draw a new card.&#10;&#10;WHEN IT'S NOT YOUR TURN:&#10;1. Sit patiently and weep for a dying world.&#10;2. OR INTERRUPT THE APOCALYPSE WITH A HERO.&#10;&#10;WHEN IT'S OVER:&#10;For each card in your hand:&#10;1. Score 1 point for each Normal Cube in the city shown&#10;2. Score 2 points for each Special Cube in the city shown&#10;3. Score 3 points for every Hero Card you're still holding onto.&#10;&#10;There, now you can run around trying to dodge the apocalypse. You're fully prepared. Don't get your hopes up. We're all dead.&#10;&#10;...Oh, you're still reading. Okay, look. You'll always have five cards; each card has a city on it. Each turn, you're going to play one of those cards--which destroys that city's population. At the end of the game, however, your score will be based on the populations in the cities shown on the cards in your hand at that point.&#10;&#10;In other words, you're moving populations towards the same cities you might destroy. The solution? Pick a few cards in your hand and try your best not to play them; move populations to those cities (we could call them...um...refuge cities) and try to avoid destroying them.&#10;&#10;The only problem is, sometimes you can't help but play those cards. If you're not careful, you'll wind up sacking one of your own refuge cities. Pay close attention to what your opponents are doing and try to avoid their disastrous card plays. Or better yet, try to secretly benefit from the moves they make: figure out their refuge cities, and save those cards in your own hand!&#10;&#10;The deck also includes six Hero cards, which are shuffled throughout; you can play them on an opponent's turn to prevent the disaster they were trying to deploy. When the third Hero appears, the game is over and you score your points. It sounds cool, but the Heroes may actually just enslave us all--because isn't that the inevitable flow of power evolving in a post-apocalyptic wasteland anyway? ISN'T IT ALL POINTLESS?&#10;&#10;",
