After the judge gives a signal, players stretch out one arm, then players form teams with the other players who stretch out an arm with a bracelet in the same color. Depending on the size of the team, the players have to form an architectural wonder by following the instructions on a card, e.g., create the Great Wall of China with a horizontal row of five hands. All players on the fastest team get a reward card for either their left or right arm, depending on what they used. The first player to collect three left and three right cards wins.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "At the start of the racing card game Minuscule, each player randomly receives two betting cards (out of 14) and five action cards (out of 33). A betting card is numbered from 1 to 7, with two copies of each card.&#10;&#10;Beginning with the starting player, each player lays one of the seven critter cards on the table, adding it to the foremost or hindmost position. At the end of the initial set up, the seventh critter card is flipped, marking it as the &quot;dark horse&quot; in the race. On a player's turn, they must play an action card and execute its effect, e.g., moving the fourth critter card forward or backward two spaces, moving the number 6 critter card forward or backward one space, or exchanging one of your betting cards with an unused betting card.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the player can pick up one of the three &quot;dark horse&quot; tokens, which is worth 5 points if the &quot;dark horse&quot; ends the race in the top three positions; if not, that token is worth -3 points.&#10;&#10;After five turns, each player reveals their two betting cards and receives points according to the matching critter card's position: 10, 8, 6, 4, 3, 2, and 1 point(s) for first through seventh place. After accounting for the dark horse tokens, whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Minuscule was first released under the title Dark Horse with a horse-racing theme.&#10;&#10;",

The &quot;last man standing&quot; in a battle will be awarded a prize card and the player with the most prize cards after three battles were fought is declared victor (in case of ties, additional turns will be held until one player emerges victorious).&#10;&#10;This game is a deckbuilding game on the lines of Dominion, Thunderstone, Nightfall and others as each player will start out with one Starting Pixelmon and a Starting Deck associated with it. Over the course of the game players will build up and optimize their decks by &quot;learning&quot; (buying from a supply) new attacks which they can use in battle phase to overcome the other player's Pixelmon teams.&#10;&#10;The game will be illustrated in glorious retro-style pixel artwork and graphics by the game's designer himself.&#10;&#10;",

You are a member of a rescue team sent to aid them, but as you investigate the site, you encounter something terrible that seeks to destroy your team from within...&#10;&#10;You'll need intuition, nerves of steel, and clever acting if you're going to survive and win the game. Who will believe you? Who is whom, and who is what? You can't trust anyone and no one will trust you, so block the doors, quarantine a suspect, reveal your identity to your &quot;allies&quot;, grab a flamethrower, or run away &mdash; but look carefully where you will end up because &quot;The Thing&quot; might be closer than you think...&#10;&#10;In Stay Away!, 4-12 players try to track down &quot;The Thing&quot;, a creature &#226;&#128;&#168;awakened from a nauseating eternal slumber on the emerged R'lyeh island that has the capability of possessing the human body, cloning it, then taking its place, so as you play you won't know who &quot;The Thing&quot; is or when someone will become &quot;The Thing&quot; or who is infected or not. The archaeologists are looking for The Thing; their goal is to work together to identify which player is The Thing and roast it with a &quot;Flamethrower&quot; card. You remain Human until The Thing passes an &quot;Infected!&quot; card to you during a card exchange, at which point you become an Infected and take on that new Role: You are now an ally of The Thing and must take care that its identity is not revealed.&#10;&#10;",

When a player draws a bomb card all players have to draw a card from the card pile. If the color matches that of the bomb, the bomb explodes and this player has to draw 4 cards.&#10;&#10;",

Every tile must connect, and a row of two just won&rsquo;t do. Use a trade token to swap a tricky tile and hope for a Wild tile in return. You will need to switch, shuffle and &quot;pivit&quot; your tiles to place them all and claim the highest scoring stick.&#10;&#10;&#10;Each tile features one of six different colors and one of six different designs. Every player draws 24 tiles, and then races the other players to complete an interlocking grid with those tiles. A row or column in the grid must contain at least three tiles, and the tiles must feature either all the same design or all the same color. If the designs in a row or column are the same, then all the colors must be different, and vice versa. Players may discard tiles and draw replacements if they have trouble completing their grids. Players score according to the order in which they completed their grids. The first player to 24 points wins.&#10;&#10;",

The ship moves in a circle around a series of islands stopping at a pier on each island where a player can leave the ship and then move point to point across the island to a location where a counter is placed.&#10;&#10;Most counters are blank on the reverse side.  There are however two counters (one for Robinson Crusoe, and another for his man Friday).  When the player finds both locations, which he keeps secret from his opponents, he must then take the ship back to the starting island and declare  where he believes the Crusoe and Friday counters are located.&#10;&#10;There are a total of 10 counters placed face down on ten different locations (one on each of 10 islands).  The spinner also has two spaces which indicate the player should draw a card instead of move a certain number of spaces.  The cards either direct the player to &quot;move the ship to any island&quot;, or move the Pawn directly to any island without having to use the ship to carry his pawn.&#10;&#10;",

Noble houses engage each other in a series of fierce battles, and it's up to the players and the Dogs of War they control to deploy their private armies in support of whatever house they wish to favor. Clockwork knights and imposing war machines shift the tides of war as they enter the battlefields, but the interest of their Dog of War captains actually lie in the rewards offered by each noble house to its supporters. Each Dog of War has a special ability that helps them claim influence, win battles, or betray the house to which they've sworn allegiance!&#10;&#10;Dogs of War is not a game of pure military power, but rather a game in which deception and betrayal often lead the way to a decisive victory. The goal for the Dogs of War is to earn the most power by the end of the game. Thanks to thoughtful game design and development, there are many ways to achieve this, like defeating other captains in battle, getting rewards from the Houses you help, amassing gold and troops, and most importantly, gaining influence with the most successful Houses.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "A Scrabble-like game and board that uses number counters instead of letter tiles. The object of the game is to score as many rows of figures that add up to 21. Players take turns placing counters from their personal sets, of which they have three in hand.&#10;&#10;Scoring does not begin until the fourth round, to allow numbers to build up on the board. During the initial three rounds players may not place a counter if the total in a straight line in any direction would exceed 21.&#10;&#10;From the fourth round on, players aim to place counters so that they complete lines adding up to 21. The basic score for a line adding up to 21 is 5 points, but 10 points can be scored by placing the counter on a square that matches the colour of your own pieces, or more by placing the counter on squares marked 15, 20 or 30, scoring that many points respectively.&#10;&#10;When a line adding up to 21 is scored, the counter that was last placed is turned face down. No counters may be placed adjacent to such a counter, except for the counter with a star, which counts as 21 in its own right.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player has used all his counters on no player is able to play.&#10;&#10;The player with the highest score is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Fill up your Caravelas with spices and precious metals and return to Lisbon to claim glory and all the points you earned in your journey. But you must be careful when passing the Cape of Good Hope, &quot;Adamastor&quot; may sink your boats.&#10;&#10;This simplified version comes from the success of &quot;Caravelas&quot;, and maintains the goal and amazing graphics of the previous game, as well as its didactic interest, but in which rules and play duration are reduced in order to make it more accessible to young players.&#10;&#10;How is it played?&#10;&#10;Each player in turn spends up to 4 of his motion cards to move his caravels (by moving the corresponding number of squares on the predetermined sea routes). Then he can discover locations, load resources, and deliver them in Lisbon to gain victory points. At the end of his move, he can return the motion cards that he did not spend or save them for the next play. Finally, he picks new cards until he has 4 motion cards in his hand and the turn passes to the next player.&#10;&#10;The game is much simpler than &quot;Caravelas&quot; (1st version) in several aspects. There are less components. Only 4 pages of rules (instead of 16). Caravels move only on predetermined routes. Number of moves is determined by the motion cards (instead of depending on the route followed by the ship). There are no event cards. Management of the ships is simplified. Etc.&#10;&#10;This new version of the game has been developed for a broader (and/or younger) public.&#10;&#10;",

If you would jump over a obstacle after you have rolled a 2, 3 or 4 you have to take the top card from the deck and according to the card's colour different things will happen: If it's green you have passed the jump, if it's yellow you have knocked down the obstacle and get a yellow fault-marker and if it's red your horse has refused to jump and you have to stop and take a red fault-marker. A roll of 5 or 6 makes you just jump over the obstacle without taking a card. The fastest horse with least faults is the winner.&#10;&#10;The game is played in the box.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "James Bond is a game of speed and frantic simultaneous action that takes under five minutes to play. It is played with a standard poker deck with Jokers removed. Each player tries to be the first to transform the piles of cards they have been dealt into sets of four-of-a-kind. They do this by exchanging cards from their piles with the four face-up cards in the center of the table. A player may only hold and look at one of his piles at a time, and may only exchange one card at a time with the one of the cards on the table. There are no turns; everyone works at once. The four face-up cards on the table are thus constantly changing along with the makeup of the players' piles. The first player to have converted all his piles to four-of-a-kind is the winner.&#10;&#10;James Bond is also known as Atlantis or Chanhassen. Players must say the game's name when they've finished in order to win.&#10;&#10;Note: The date and origins of the game are unknown, although it seems to be recent, perhaps as recent as 2009.&#10;&#10;",

The sentence itself often gives an innocuous clue to the blank. Players then compare answers and score points for matching answers.&#10;&#10;One player acts as quizmaster and the other players take turns to be a &quot;contestant&quot; and a &quot;panelist.&quot; The quizmaster decides who the first contestant is going to be the first question is read out and the contestant and panelists write their answers on the sheet provided.&#10;&#10;When everyone has recorded their answer, the contestant reads out his answer first, followed by each panelist in turn. Each time that the answer of the contestant matches that of the panelist the contestant gets a point.&#10;&#10;The two contestants with the highest number of points then go on to play the &quot;Super Match Game.&quot; In this game there are three possible answers to each question--the answers are worth 50 points, 100 points or 150 points. When a player matches any of these answers, they record the number of points won. The player with the most points at the end of the Super Match is the winner and goes on to the Head to Head game, the last round.&#10;&#10;Blankety Blank: Travel allows 3-9 players where the base game allows 3-6, and may be played alone or with the base game.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Vive l'Empereur Series - Vol. VIII&#10;Quatre Batailles en Espagne (Four battles in Spain)&#10;Peninsular War, 1808-1814&#10;&#10;Vive l'Empereur Series is a simulation of the battles fought during the Napoleonic Era in Europe, between 1805 and 1815. The scale is the regiment, a good compromise between the brigade level (with no formations) and the detailed battalions. The scale is 250 m/hex and a turn is 30 minutes.&#10;&#10;Vitoria, fought on June 21, 1813, was one of the most decisive battles of the Peninsular War. It was the last major battle between the allied British, Portuguese and Spanish forces and the French armies, and opened the way for the invasion of France. It opposed 60,000 French soldiers commanded by King Joseph to 80,000 allies superbly trained and equipped attacking on three sides. Looking like a one-sided battle, things are far from obvious for the Allies and many what-ifs make the situation very interesting.&#10;&#10;Oca&ntilde;a, fought on 19 November 1809 was a major Spanish defeat that ended any chance of success in the Spanish Junta&rsquo;s autumn campaign of 1809. The largest Spanish army under general Areizaga, more than 55,000 men, moved toward Madrid but allowed Marshal Soult and King Joseph to concentrate around 30,000 men. A brutal clash occurred at Oca&ntilde;a, and a French cavalry movement on the flank rolled the Spanish line.&#10;&#10;Salamanca, fought on 22 July 1812, was a turning point in 1812.  The battle saw the Anglo-Portuguese army under the Duke of Wellington defeat Marshal Marmont's French forces among the hills around Arapiles, south of Salamanca. Both armies, 50,000 men each, have been marching and countermarching for days trying to outflank each other. Wellington eventually caught the French in an over-extended position and struck at the center. A very well balanced battle, where a better concentration gave the advantage to Wellington.&#10;&#10;Sorauren is the last battle of the counteroffensive by Soult&rsquo;s reorganized army of Spain in July 1813. It was part of a series of engagements in late July 1813 called the Battle of the Pyrenees in which a combined British and Portuguese force under Sir Arthur Wellesley held off Marshal Soult's French forces attempting to relieve Pamplona. Attacking a thin red line in a very good defensive position, the French were eventually pushed back, but the battle could have turned very differently.&#10;&#10;(source: Legion Games website)&#10;&#10;",

The game contains 57 of the first 100 sight words children need to learn to become fluent readers. Each card has one sight word that matches with every other card in the deck!&#10;&#10;To play the game in a whole group, pass out one card to each student. The other cards are placed around the room. Children travel around the room to find the sight word on each card that matches with one of the words on their card. Children can write the matching words and/or make a tally mark for each match they find as they go around the room. Students can also work with a partner to find the matching words.&#10;&#10;When playing in a small group, one card is dealt to each player with remaining cards face up in a pile in the center.The first player to find their match calls out the word and takes that card. The player with the most cards at the end of the game wins!&#10;&#10;",

Each player, using his own deck of playing cards, will code a single word using one of two ciphers available to them. Once both players have coded a message they will then exchange the cards and start to decode their opponent&rsquo;s password. The first to crack the code will have several strategical maneuvers available at his disposal while the person who fails to crack the code will be given only one move. The key objective is to control as much of your enemy&rsquo;s territory as possible before the game ends after ten rounds of code cracking.&#10;&#10;Setup&#10;Place the map between you and your opponent. In addition to the map, each player has a card shield to place upright in front of them. This not only keeps your code making secret but also is used to show the two ciphers available for coding. To begin, each player should have 5 pennies placed on opposite sides of the map (on the edge closest to you). At this point, you should be ready to start creating codes.&#10;&#10;Play&#10;Each turn begins with both players creating a code using one of two ciphers available. The secret code must be at least three letters long and not have the same letter repeating more than twice. Once both players have cards selected to spell out their coded word, exchange cards. At this point, the person who can correctly decode their opponent&rsquo;s message first will be awarded the next move on the map.The player who successfully decoded the message will have a list of maneuvers they can choose from while the other opponent (who failed) is only allowed one single move.&#10;&#10;Game end&#10;The game ends when all ten rounds of code cracking have been completed and all final moves have been made. The game play length can be adjusted by increasing or decreasing the amount of rounds to be played.&#10;&#10;",

You may even have to resort to some early morning grave swapping &mdash; or you could just rob the graves of all the jewelry you can dig up...it isn't like they're going to need it anyway!

        "description": "Liberty Match was inspired by Go Fish. It can be played with 2 to 6 players. It is played with American Standard Playing Cards, which is a deck of cards inspired by traditional playing cards.&#10;&#10;THE DECK&#10;&#10;The 58-card deck has 4 suits (Faith, Declaration, Revolution, and Unity) with 14 ranks: The 1st - 10th Amendment, A Gentleman, a Lady, a Patriot, and a Foundation.  There are also 2 Jokers, which are actually a king and queen. The suits are in 2 colors: Red and Blue.&#10;&#10;Faith is represented by a Blue Triangle, (The &quot;All-seeing Eye of the Creator&quot; - like on the back of the $1 Bill)&#10;Declaration by a Red Pentagon&#10;Revolution by a Red Triquetra (Trinity Knot) with a coiled &quot;Don't tread on me!&quot; style snake in the center.)&#10;and Unity by a Blue Circle with 13 stars.&#10;&#10;The deck was designed to have a theme of American history and patriotism.  Since America was founded by declaring independence of a royalty-based ruling system, the face cards and suits were changed.  The Amendment cards have portions of the actual text of the named Constitutional Amendment printed on the card, and that text is used in the playing of &quot;Liberty Match&quot;.&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY&#10;&#10;The dealer deals between 5-7 cards to each player (depending on how many players there are). The remaining playing cards are placed face down to form a stock.  The player to dealer's left starts.&#10;&#10;Once a pair is made (even if dealt a pair from the beginning) it is to be laid down, face up, on the table in front of the player.&#10;&#10;In each turn, a player asks for a rank of card that they already have in their hand from a specific other player.  If the asked player has that card, they must give the asking player that card.  If the asked player does not have that card, they reply with &quot;Catch a Liberty&quot; - then the asking player takes the top card from the deck on the table.&#10;&#10;Before play can continue, the asking player must read the text from one of the other cards in their hand - just the text, not the name of the card.  (Players cannot continue to read the same card repeatedly, unless it is their last card.)&#10;&#10;If the asking player is given the card they asked for, or if they draw a card that matches one of the cards they are holding, they can continue to go.  If a player is told to &quot;Catch a Liberty&quot; and is unable to make a pair, the next player may go.&#10;&#10;When a player has no playing cards left, they must then draw a playing card from the stock until all playing cards run out. The game continues until all the playing cards are played even the stock. The winner is the player who then has the most pairs in front of them.&#10;&#10;Example of a turn:&#10;&#10;Player 1 asks Player 3 if they have the 1st Amendment. Player 3 hands Player 1 a 1st Amendment. Player 1 lays down the two 1st Amendment cards, then reads &quot;A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.&quot; (the text from the 2nd Amendment.) And then asks Player 2 if they have any 4th Amendments.  Player 2 says &quot;Catch a Liberty&quot;.  Player 1 draws a card and then reads &quot;Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.&quot;  It is now Player 2's turn.&#10;&#10;There are 2 Jokers the &quot;King of Tyranny&quot; and &quot;The King's Queen&quot; - these have the 4 suits from the standard - or French Deck.&#10;&#10;",

Two senior wizards are now contending to fill his shoes and bring a state of harmony back to the Institute. However, the wizards have contrasting ideas about the Institute's direction. To gain the title of headmaster, the wizards must gain the trust of their colleagues and gather as much magical powers through the tools of their trade as possible.&#10;&#10;The Institute for Magical Arts is a two-player dice and area control game in which players use dice rolls to place &quot;power stones&quot; onto different cards in an attempt to win those cards. Once won, cards offer either special powers or victory points or both.&#10;&#10;",

Players are fishermen trying to earn a living in one of nature's best providers: the sea. Over the course of five rounds, you'll need to bring back enough fish, and use your connections to help your fishing livelihood survive. Make wise choices to increase the number of actions you can take, and borrow money carefully to help further your finances.&#10;&#10;In Isaribi, players have a limited number of action points, and on their turn they perform actions such as get fish, sell the fish, upgrade their fishing ship or net, and gain more AP. Whoever is able to gain the most wealth wins.&#10;&#10;",

The player whose turn it is grabs one card from each pile and the combination of traits listed makes up their potential lover. For instance:&#10;&#10;&#10;        PERK: They Have A Giant Robot&#10;        QUIRK: They Have An Adult Baby Fetish.&#10;&#10;&#10;Everyone secretly votes if that player would date the weird combination, and those that know their friend best get a point.&#10;&#10;The game continues as you find out weird facts about your friends, and the person that knows their friends' preferences best wins!&#10;&#10;",

(What is a &quot;waggle dance&quot; you ask? It's a series of patterned movements performed by a scouting bee to tell other bees in the colony the direction and distance of a food source or hive site.)&#10;&#10;Players need to organize their bees to make as much honey as possible to see the hive through the coming winter. The winner is the first player to successfully create 7 or more honey tokens in their hive. It's up to you how to achieve this: Do you focus on nectar collection, increasing your bee population, expanding your hive, seeking favor with the queen, or splitting your resources to accomplish all of these? Whatever you choose, the natural world is a competitive environment and you can be sure the other players will be looking to maximize their advantage.&#10;&#10;Waggle Dance is designed to be a highly accessible language independent game with a simple rule-sheet appealing to all levels of gamers.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Publisher Blurb:&#10;&#10;Fight a dragon. Steal treasure. Don&rsquo;t get eaten. The dragon hunter&rsquo;s creed.&#10;&#10;Heroes have tracked a dragon back to its lair. Now they battle the beast while snatching up treasures. They can steal the good stuff from one another while the fight goes on. All the while the dragon fights back swallowing heroes and treasures that slowly move towards the beast&rsquo;s fiery stomach.&#10;&#10;Hungry Dragon is a 54 card deck fighting/stealing game that includes character, weapon, treasure, and dragon part cards. Players control the dragon or a team of four heroes. The heroes move in close to fight, hang back a little to snatch treasure, or stay safe out of range of the dragon&rsquo;s claws. Each turn players get a free move and may make one action. Their chance of success is based on how much noise they make. Make a roar and the roll is okay. Brag about how well you do and the chance of succeeding is great. Prepare to make some noise, this is a boisterous game.&#10;&#10;Once the dragon is dead (or escapes) the player with the most valuable treasure wins!&#10;&#10;The Amazon and Pirate versions of the game add together to form a single bigger game.&#10;&#10;",

You must also save the possessions from the burning inferno but not at the cost of letting a room burn down. How should you prioritize?

Beware, if the entire castle burns down, all players lose!&#10; Game mechanism include:&#10;&#10;1. Changing game board: The basic game board is fixed but the spread of the fire is unique for every game. &#10;2. Interdependence: The players cooperate to extinguish the fire. &#10;3.

        "description": "From the designer notes:  &quot;JITO is a multi-game format rather than a single game.  It can be simply competative, like most games.  It can be a sophisticated game that features competitive cooperation, or it can be a completely cooperative game.  You are invited to invent your own game using the board, but we would suggest that you start with the usual competitive game to learn how to balance cards most effectively and how to guess future peg locations with the greatest success. (Remember that the longest dimension of a card is from one corner to another.)&quot;&#10;&#10;In Game I., 2 players (or 2 teams of 2 players) compete to be the first the cross the board from one site to the opposite side with a continuous bridge of cards balanced on pegs.&#10;&#10;Play progresses by each player throwing 2,d6 dice then a player may place a peg in the area on the board that matches the number thrown.  After placing a peg, you may attempt to balance one or more cards on your peg(s).  You may not overlap or touch an opponent's card bridge or share pegs.  You must place a card within 20 seconds or lose your turn.  The game ends when one of the players spans the board from one side to the opposite side (side to side, up and down, or diagonally).  A completed bridge is worth 3 points.  The usual match is to 6, 9, or 12 points.&#10;&#10;Game II variant:  This variant is a cooperative/competitive game for 3 players.   Three players attempt to cross the board, but at any time 2 players may voluntarily decide to merge and build a bridge together.  If they succeed in reaching the opposite site first, each player receives 1.5 points.  The usual match is to 4, 5, or 7 points.&#10;&#10;Game III variant:  This version is fully cooperative and is for 2, 3, or, 4 players.  All players work together to build a successful bridge. Individual scoring is assessed by counting the same-colored number of cards belonging to an individual player.  You may also desire to set a time limit as the goal for building a bridge together.&#10;&#10;",

Assemble your team, visit haunted locations and submit evidence to close the cases - but be warned - not only must you deal with Murphy's Law, but with other paranormal teams investigating the same places as you - and chances are, they won't be helpful. Never before has Paranormal Division been so fun!&#10;&#10;Players compete to score the most points they can by playing Evidence cards at three separate locations. Each turn a player picks up a card and either plays or discards a card - each time they are faced with a choice: they can play a card to help themselves or to hinder their opponent.  Event cards are triggered at various points in the game to introduce an element of randomness and can either be good or bad - you never know!&#10;&#10;Meant as a stand-alone game, it can be played straight out of the box.  Expansions are being developed to keep gameplay fresh, while maintaining the core rules.&#10;&#10;",

All players write down a subject of a topic. In this example, we'll say &quot;Fictional Characters&quot;. After everyone has written something on a piece of paper (Or in our prototype version, our curved white boards) and placed it in the middle of the table, they are shuffled and the two players choose one. That choice will be the sides they are representing. In this example, we will say &quot;Superman&quot; and &quot;Darth Vader&quot;. On the other side of the card is the question. In this example, the question may be &quot;Who would win in a fight?&quot; Now is the time that it is revealed and the two players begin the debate. Players may do anything in their power to get the other players to vote for their side. Points are earned by winning a debate and voting for a winner.&#10;&#10;What's The Question? is a great game for any crowd. Because the players create the content, the game can be used in a family atmosphere, or amongst your friends over a long night of drinks. This game takes the idea of sitting around with your friends while you debate about things that don't matter, then adding a random element to it fueled by the players.&#10;&#10;Planned expansions include adult themed pack, intelligence pack, and much more!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "On the mythical archaeological zone of Palenque, located in the Chiapas State, Mexico, there is a pyramid known as &quot;The Temple of inscriptions&quot;, built by the Mayans to shelter king Pakal's tomb.  The tomb was discovered on June 1952 and it represents one of the most important archaeological discoveries of history.&#10;&#10;In this game the players collaborate with the pyramid construction and each player tries to accumulate the biggest treasure in order to win the game. The treasure is formed by the treasure tiles that are obtained during the construction stages, and the jewel cards that can be accumulated till the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The rounds are composed by 3 phases.  Each phase concludes when all the players have performed their play for that phase.&#10;&#10;PHASE 1: CARDS DRAW&#10;Each player draws 2 cards from the top of the pile.  If a player draws a card of a level that has been already constructed, this card is sent to the discard pile and the player can draw a new card.&#10;&#10;PHASE 2: CARDS SWAP&#10;Each player can swap one of their cards with one card at the swap zone; players must leave the cards face up. Cards of already constructed levels cannot be used.&#10;&#10;PHASE 3: CONSTRUCTION&#10;Each player decides if he summons to the construction of the pyramid's level, if he chooses not to, then the player must mention that he passes the opportunity to the next player.&#10;If no player summons to the construction, then is the end of the phase 3 and the round concludes.&#10;When a player summons to the construction he must pay 1 point (with his treasure tiles) and place the tile over the gameboard, this gives him the right to be the first to set cards for construction.&#10;&#10;CONSTRUCTION RULES&#10;-Pyramid levels must be constructed in ascending order.&#10;-Each pyramid level is completed with 5 construction cards of the corresponding level.&#10;-Jewel cards can be used as wild cards.  Two jewel cards will be considered as one construction  card, so they must be used in pairs for this purpose.&#10;-A player can set a m&aacute;ximum of 3 construction cards.&#10;&#10;If a player summons to the construction but the 5 necessary consturction cards (required for the corresponding level) are not completed, then players take back the set cards and the player that has summoned to the construction loses the point that he has paid.  In this case is also the end of phase 3 and the round concludes.&#10;&#10;In case that the construction of the corresponding level is completed:&#10;-The corresponding pyramid tile is placed over the gameboard.&#10;-The players that have collaborated in the construction take the corresponding points from the treasure tiles at the gameboard (see the scoring rules).&#10;-Cards used for the construction are sent to the discard pile.&#10;-If any player has cards left of the consturcted level, then he must place them on the discard pile (players have no right to recover these cards).&#10;-If there are cards of the constructed level at the swap zone, they are placed on the discard pile as well and replaced with cards from the pile.&#10;&#10;END OF GAME&#10;When the construction of level 9 of the pyramid (temple) is completed, the game ends.&#10;The jewel cards that players have accumulated have a value of 1 point each and are added to the value of thier treasure tiles.  The winner is the player with the most treasure points.&#10;&#10;",

Valid sets are as follows:&#10;&#10;     a group of three or more of the same number&#10;     a flush of three or more of the same suit&#10;     a swatch of three or more cards of the same color&#10;&#10;&#10;As the &quot;Rummy&quot; part of the name implies, you may scavenge cards from other players' melded sets in order to flesh out the set you are melding from your hand.  After melding a set, if you have two or three of the three colors of a suit-number combo, whose matching hex has not yet been claimed, you claim it permanently. Furthermore, if you control a majority of the  hexes 1&ndash;5 of that suit, you immediately (and permanently) claim the null.&#10;&#10;The game features several variants, as well:&#10;&#10;     Controlled Zoning &mdash; Setup is not random; instead, players take turns adding hexes to the board.&#10;     Border Disputes &mdash; Hexes claimed with just two colors can be stolen; however hexes claims made with all three colors are still permanent.&#10;     The Hard Way &mdash; Groups and flushes are no longer valid.  They are replaced by these two sets:&#10;         a sequence of five cards: 1&ndash;5.&#10;         a suite of four cards: one each of suns, moons, arms, crowns.&#10;    &#10;     Piecepack &mdash; Play the game with a standard piecepack, instead of a standard hexpack.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

In an unfortunate circumstance, their rich father, a foreign national from Connecticut, was killed in an airplane crash. His bank account is now being locked down by government auditors in the US. The players will be seeking assistance from bank account holders in order to transfer the inheritance money back to Nigeria and into their own accounts. The player with the most Naira in their account at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;In Beneficiary, the players will each choose 5 of the 8 counties in Connecticut to send mass emails to. Each county has a Naira value (per supporter) and a special ability. The 3 counties not chosen will provide the player with a special ability they can use during the game. If both players choose the same counties they will have to bribe and negotiate with each other until one backs down.&#10;&#10;Then, each county is resolved individually. The active player will choose pairs of tiles secretly arranged by their opponent. They will continue until they are happy with the number of supporters, or until they fail out because of scam reports. Each successful supporter will add Naira to the active player's score. Will you cash in the supporters early enough or will you push your luck too far and have to withdraw from the county?&#10;&#10;",

These cards are placed face down, one per agent, and include funding for their political or scheme activities and the activities themselves. Cards may be legal or illegal to play. After every player has placed their cards, they start revealing and getting the effects of the cards played on a turn-by-turn basis. Each judge investigates one agent per turn, placing tokens right before anyone starts revealing cards. If the agent's card is illegal upon revelation, a trial against the agent takes place. All players having judges can influence the trial's outcome, which might involve losing the agent and the card played by them.&#10;&#10;",

The game consists of a game board divided into two sections by a boundary line straight down the middle, twelve fighter planes, four recon planes, sixteen hit or miss air defense tokens, four different colored dice and four separate sets of cards with twenty- five cards in each set. &#10;The dice are color coded for each squadron. When red and black squadrons move, the amount moved is determined by rolling the black and red dice together. When green and blue squadrons move, green and blue dice are rolled. The number appearing on each die must be moved by that color squadron, whether it is a fighter or a recon plane. No two planes of the same color may be moved in the same turn.&#10;&#10;When a fighter has been shot down or destroyed on the ground, the victorious plane receives an ace sticker, to be placed by the victorious plane. Should the winning plane lands safely on its home base, the entire squadron then attains single ace status. The ace sticker is then placed in the corner of the home base's name square. Triple ace status is the highest. In the game you have Recons that destroy fighters on the ground, force fighters to scramble, and expose openings in the air defenses. The game has speed lanes which enable diagonal movement. Otherwise movement is restricted to horizontal or vertical directions.&#10;&#10;",

Carefully blending the historic with the cinematic, Gunman&rsquo;s Law recreates the gunfights of the mid-to-late 1800s with an unprecedented mix of versatility and verisimilitude.&#10;&#10;Gunman&rsquo;s Law allows both the solo player and multiple players (either &quot;versus&quot; or cooperatively) to recreate everything from the classic one-on-one showdown in a town&rsquo;s main street to deadly ambushes. Hire your gun out to farmers being pushed off their land by a local cattle baron, or go to the aid of the town&rsquo;s lawman who has to ride out to where a group of stagecoach robbers are reputedly hiding.&#10;&#10;Part board game, part RPG and great for use with miniatures, Gunman&rsquo;s Law breaks new ground by using a multi-purpose Fast Action Card deck to determine everything from a shootist&rsquo;s speed and accuracy, reaction to danger, damage done and effect of that damage.&#10;&#10;",

The game starts with the first player drafting a Railcar card from his hand, attaching it to his train, then passing the rest of his hand to the player to his left. This draft continues until all players have added one Railcar to their train for each round of the game. The trick is, while each new Railcar must match the resource type or value of the one previously played, players always have the option to play any card face down as a Wild Railcar; the Wild Railcars don't have much value, but they can be used to save a player in a bind or to thwart your opponents by &quot;hiding&quot; a card they need.&#10;&#10;Yardmaster Express plays in ten minutes and consists of just 32 cards (no tokens, no cargo cards).&#10;&#10;",

You can build programs such as the civilian conservation corps and the civil works administration.

Players have to choose between opening up more programs or using their money to decrease their debt and build large public works projects which give victory points at the end of the game.  Sometimes borrowing large sums of money pays off and sometimes it lands you in the poor house.&#10;&#10;",

Geometry, skill, and space-time travel.&#10;&#10;Flatland is based on the Victorian novel centering around various universes occupied by poly-dimensional people. Players put together their hands of geometric character shapes - custom etched into a set of twelve dice. The strength of each piece is determined by the number of sides and the figure's dimensionality. Players select a piece to play against their opponent and roll. The winner of each round takes both pieces, and the first to lose all of his pieces loses. Easy! However, behind this simple set of rules is a complex game of strategy and chance.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Guerra de Mitos IV (Great Old Ones Invasion) is a card game set in a fantastic world where different mythologies coexist. It is a different, dynamic game designed to be able to build different decks with very distinct and varied strategies, and each installment increases both the number of available mythologies and the game possibilities.&#10;&#10;The game contains 150 cards split between the Great Old Ones and reinforcements for GDM I, GDM II and GDM III. Great Old Ones includes 2 pantheons (cards that define your game strategy) + 33 cards for the gods deck (which includes characters, events and resources) + 40 cards for the designs deck (actions, equipment and summonings)and reinforcements to 150 new cards for GDM.&#10;&#10;Each player in War of the Myths IV needs to build his own deck of at least 51 cards (1 pantheon / 20 gods / 30 designs) of his choice, and each installment increases the diversity of characters, actions and strategies you can use in order to achieve victory.&#10;&#10;Each player has to bring into play the cards his oracles offer him and play actions from the designs deck both in the influence phase (where the gods plan from their pantheon) and in the confrontation phase (where the characters who decide to go to battle fight to decrease the opponent&rsquo;s power) to obtain supremacy or consign the opponent to oblivion.&#10;&#10;",

It is a turn-based action, dexterity and tactical game. It is similar to the game Blood Bowl, but mixes in elements from curling and real soccer. With the special abilities and constantly expanding races, weapons and spells, you can fight over the control of the ball and then actually shoot at a miniature goal to score.&#10;&#10;Actually, our greatest unique feature is that we take all of the action to the FLOOR! Rather than small miniatures on a table in a virtual environment, we have huge miniatures you actually kick and slide around in any environment; whether that is your living room, your yard, at the beach, on the street. You can play almost anywhere.&#10;&#10;Our game puts you in control, using your own tactics, dexterity, and shooting action, rather than letting the dice decide the outcome. Another great feature of KiCKeT!-ARENA is that you can play with our basic rules for a simpler and faster game, or with our advanced rules that turn the game into a strategic battle.&#10;&#10;Build your team with different talents, weapons and magic to play KiCKeT! in your very own arena set up in your living room, garden, backyard or even at the beach!&#10;&#10;KiCKeT! Arena mixes up fantasy games and soccer to create a kicking, passing, and fighting action game.&#10;&#10;Our curved solid wooden bases make the figures slide over many different surfaces including grass, carpet, and sand. With the addition of a base sock or an asphalt glider, you can even play on tile, laminate, hardwood, stone, or asphalt. Play almost anywhere!&#10;&#10;In the future, we plan to offer even more figures, weapons, spells, abilities and obstacles to expand gameplay.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "WarBirds is a very detailed board game system that recreates aerial combat engagements from 1914 to the present day. Each module covers an important era of development, World War I, Inter War Years, World War II, Korea and the Modern era. Taken together, the full series will show how the aircraft has evolved as a weapons system.&#10;&#10;Each module will use the same core movement and combat systems and share basic rules between the modules where appropriate. For example, the same rules are used to cover aircraft movement across all modules. Learn one set of rules and you will be able to play any module with the addition of era specific rules such as RADAR or turbine engines.&#10;&#10;Each module uses the same basic rules, chart and table layout. The modules scale has been adjusted to fit aircraft performance of the era. For example, the World War I module has a scale of 100 feet per hex, 4.5 seconds per Tactical Game turn and each flight point is 15 mph. The Inter War Years module uses a scale of 200 feet per hex, 4.5 seconds per game turn and each flight point is 30 mph. The World War II module uses a scale of 300 feet per hex, 4.5 seconds per game turn and 50 mph per flight point. The Korean module uses a scale of 500 feet per hex, 4.5 seconds and 75 mph per flight point. The Modern rules use a scale of 800 feet per hex, 6 seconds per game turn and 100 mph per flight point.&#10;&#10;The game may be played on two levels depending on the level of detail desired, Tactical Combat and Flight Operations. When using the Tactical Combat scale, a map board and counters that represent individual aircraft and ground units are used to play combat engagements. At the Flight Operations scale, the player is responsible for meeting mission requirements and leading his flight to and from the target area.&#10;&#10;The WarBirds Game System shows the performance differences between aircraft and technological developments have in tactical combat. For example, the World War I rules show the difference between a Fokker DVII with a 160 hp Mercedes engine and one powered by a 185 hp BMW engine. Weapon synchronization systems have an impact on the rate of fire and number of hits on the target. All aircraft have a safe G-Load rating. Maneuver beyond this load and the aircraft may suffer structural damage or failure. Aircraft carry a limited amount of fuel and ammunition to complete the assigned mission. Aircrew are limited in the number of operations they may perform during the game turn by Task Points. How aircraft and aircrew limitations and technological advances influenced air combat engagements may be experienced while playing WarBirds.&#10;&#10;Each aircraft data card reflects the performance analysis of an individual aircraft, each subtype or advanced model will have a dedicated data card.&#10;&#10;Canvas Falcons is the first module to be released and covers the air war from 1914 to 1918. Fifty two aircraft data cards representing important types that saw service in the air forces of the nations involved. Fifty two tactical scenarios cover the introduction of the aircraft as a weapon armed with hand held weapons to the end of war types such as the Fokker DVIII. Five Flight Operations missions are provided. Air-to-air, air-to-ground combat rules, and balloon busting, rough running engines, fuel use, negative G facing changes, pilot workload, weapon malfunctions, the affect of weapon synchronization systems on rate of fire, pilot and aircrew quality, new and battle weary aircraft and more are addressed in WarBirds.&#10;&#10;",

But watch out for your opponents who can also play cards and steal cards to change your odds. The tricky part is that only one player can be the guesser, and each time there's an incorrect guess, the guesser rotates one spot to the left. You win the round by being the player to guess the last card correctly, so you must know when to swine-and-dine your opponents or when to cut down them down at the most opportune time. Make your guess, knock on wood, and go hog wild in this exciting game of highs and lows.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Brangle is a party game for four or more players. The game is played with a deck of 54 cards, each with three topics or categories written on one side. One player draws a card and selects the first, second, or third category (by choice or convention, depending on which set of rules is used). The player then names something that belongs to the category, prompting the next player to do the same, and so on. Play continues in this fashion until a player cannot give an answer in a reasonable amount of time (typically about 2 seconds) or repeats an answer previously used during the round. Once a player loses the round, they place the card in front of them, and draw a new card to begin the next round. The player with the fewest cards in front of them after 54 rounds is the winner.&#10;&#10;The rules included in Brangle offer suggestions for modifying gameplay. One example is to play an &quot;elimination game&quot; in which players are removed from the game after accumulating three cards. The last player remaining is the winner. It is also suggested that the game can end after a predetermined amount of time (30 minutes) instead of playing through the entire deck of cards. Another suggestion is to allow players to choose which of the three categories on each card they want to play, rather than always choosing the first, second or third.&#10;&#10;Creative or unusual answers and responses are highly encouraged. An excerpt from the rules: &quot;For the category, &ldquo;things that roll&rdquo;, a creative answer could be &ldquo;stones&rdquo; (Rolling Stones), &ldquo;Rick Astley&rdquo; (Rick Roll), or &ldquo;spring&rdquo; (spring-roll) &quot;.&#10;&#10;Brangle was created by a small group of US Marines and RAF Airmen in Afghanistan in 2011, and later developed into a commercial product by a member of that group after his service was completed in 2013.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "(from Decision Games' website)&#10;&#10;ON 6 JUNE 1944 the greatest armada the world has ever seen approached northern France. That fleet consisted of more than 5,300 ships carrying over 300,000 men and 50,000 vehicles. Opposing them was Germany&rsquo;s veteran Wehrmacht.&#10;&#10;ATLANTIC WALL is a grand-tactical simulation of that campaign. The counters represent almost every formation that participated at the company and battalion level. Infantry, armor, anti-tank, reconnaissance, engineer, assault gun, howitzer, rocket, parachute, ranger, commando, glider and headquarter units are fully represented. Features include Widerstandnesten (resistance nests), Cherbourg&rsquo;s fortifications and the all-important Bocage. The map portrays all primary and secondary roads, trails and other types of terrain, along with the villages, towns and cities that formed the bastions of German defense. As always with this series, the orders of battle have been extensively researched to provide an accurate and functional depiction of the armies of both sides.&#10;&#10;There are three introductory one-map scenarios depicting critical periods in the campaign that use an abbreviated set of rules while still maintaining the historical accuracy of the campaign game as a whole. In addition, there are three larger multi-map scenarios that allow players to either play a short period within the overall campaign or play the campaign from various starting points. The 6 June assault is covered in two modules, the Airborne Assault Module and the Amphibious Assault module, which allow players to recreate both the airborne and initial amphibious assault stage of the campaign. The Amphibious Assault Module is played on a special Beach Display that shows each sub-area of the invasion beaches with units depicted at the company level. It can be played as a solitaire scenario. The campaign game can be played from 6 June to 22 August, with a total of 234 game turns.&#10;&#10;This is the third instalment of the Grand Operational Simulation Series (GOSS), the first two being: Wacht am Rhein and Hurtgen: Hells Forest. All three games share a common rules set that&rsquo;s been extensively updated and revised to simplify game functions while still maintaining the design of the earlier games. In addition to the basic rules, Atlantic Wall includes a set of exclusive rules to cover the special requirements of the amphibious and airborne landings and the logistical system required to support the armies coming ashore.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Inspired by classic RPGs, Dungeon Crawl is a game that challenges you to explore dungeons, collect loot, and backstab your friends.&#10;&#10;Strap on your sword, grab your spellbook, and dive into the role of a dungeon delving adventurer! Be an axe wielding barbarian, a spell slinging sorceress, or divinely protected priest and battle monsters, survive traps, and talk your way past the guards to obtain their treasures. When things get tough, team up with a friend, but only until they outlive their usefulness,  because there can be only one winner in Dungeon Crawl!&#10;&#10;How it is played:&#10;&#10;Players choose one of 10 unique, fantasy-archetypical characters (fighter, priest, rogue, sorceress, etc.), each with different stats and powers.  They then move from town to different randomly generated locations where they have to complete combat, skill, and trap encounters to earn loot and experience points.&#10;&#10;The random and modular nature of the game means that there are over 15 billion combinations in which encounters and locations can occur.&#10;&#10;Players can team up to form parties, making it easier to complete encounters, but splitting the rewards with their group, or go solo where things are harder, but they get 100% of the rewards.  They may also use bonus tokens gained from successfully completing encounters to aid themselves or hinder their opponents.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the first level 5 dungeon is completed, and the player with the most experience points when the game ends is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

[...] Both players will flip their cards at the same time and who ever has the dominant Happening Symbol, wins, and is given the choice to either inflict damage upon their opponent or to use their card&rsquo;s special effect. The amount of damage a card can inflict is indicated by a card&rsquo;s Energy which is the whole number located under the symbol. In the case that both players play the same Happening symbol they are to look at the decimal number under the Energy. This number is the cards Gravity, and whoever has the highest Gravity, wins the that match. Players repeat this until one player&rsquo;s Ego Points are reduced to zero.&#10;&#10;",

All other calculations are done by referencing a chart of two opposing attributes (ex. Damage vs. Armor) to find a result.  The goal of this system is to speed up play and allow for large-scale battles.&#10;&#10;",

King Kyros clings on to power by any means necessary; his estranged Queen Eleftheria has joined a rebellion of conquered people; and their daughter, Princess Beatus, has rejected both of her parents to fight alongside the church.&#10;&#10;The players, as members of a secret society, wield great influence over the destiny of Aclysmia, but their job is not to set things right. They just want be on the winning side when the fighting ends. By weaving Machiavellian alliances and determining the outcome of crucial battles, they accrue influence for when the war finally resolves.&#10;&#10;Shadow Throne is played over the course of several battles. To start each battle, players gain control over characters from the warring factions by drafting a hand of cards. Next, players simultaneously play cards from their hands to determine which faction wins the battle. Players can freely switch alliances, playing cards from any faction. After the battle is fought, the faction with the most power wins, and players who played cards from that faction collect influence points. Once one player has collected enough influence, the game ends.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "At Any Cost: Metz 1870 is a game simulating the situation west of the Metz fortress during those few days of August 1870. The game is designed to be a playable, two-player brigade-scale game that allows players to experience the unique tactical warfare matchups that characterized fighting during the Franco-Prussian War.&#10;&#10;This era, though generally overlooked in the gaming industry, is a fascinating study in Napoleonic tactics (and uniforms) slamming head-on into modern killing technology. The Prussian military juggernaut is armed with the new steel Krupp breach-loading artillery pieces that far outclassed the French guns. Prussian doctrine, adapted to the lessons learned during the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, allowed junior officers to exercise initiative and aggressiveness. The French army, meanwhile, was armed with the modern and deadly Chassepot rifle, a firearm so advanced that many argue its deployment alone should have won the war for the French. In addition, the French army was now equipped with their ultimate secret weapon - the Mitrailleuse, which was the first machinegun used en masse. Moreover, the game system makes clear that the French soldier, despite misconceptions to the contrary, fought valiantly during these battles. By all rights, they could have &ndash; and should have &ndash; won many of these engagements. But leadership, morale and tenacity won the day for the Prussians.&#10;&#10;All these factors are seamlessly embedded into the At Any Cost game system and players will be challenged to utilize their advantages and minimize their disadvantages throughout the game. Will YOU as the Prussian player be able to withstand an early severe numerical disadvantage and use the brave audacity of the Prussian soldier and artilleryman to win the day? Can YOU as the French player overcome the lethargic and uninspired command structure of the Army of the Rhine and allow your tough and well-equipped infantry to fight unhindered?&#10;&#10;At Any Cost: Metz 1870 also features the Blind Swords chit-pull system which emphasizes the three &ldquo;FOW&rsquo;s&rdquo; of military conflict: fog-of-war, friction-of-war and fortunes-of-war. With each chit pull, players will be challenged to make tough decisions based on their assessment of the current situation. Unlike traditional chit-pull mechanisms, the Blind Swords system ensures that no combat units can be counted on, or conversely, counted out. This yields an environment of tense action and constant surprises &ndash; an environment that will challenge each player.&#10;&#10;UNITS&#10;&#10;All brigades and artillery groups of both the French Army of the Rhine and the Prussian First and Second Armies that took part in these actions are represented in the Order of Battle. Each Strength Point equals 600 infantrymen, 450 cavalry troopers, 3 heavy artillery pieces or 4 light artillery pieces. In addition, units have a Cohesion Rating, representing the unit&rsquo;s morale, training and experience plus a Movement Allowance.&#10;&#10;SYSTEM HIGHLIGHTS&#10;&#10;Combat and Cohesion System: The combat system is &ldquo;firepower&rdquo; based and utilizes the unit&rsquo;s size and Cohesion Rating to determine its effectiveness. The combat system is driven by a two-D10 dice mechanic. Two differently-colored dice are rolled simultaneously. The first (colored) die generates an initial result and the second (white) die simultaneously informs the players of any physical casualties suffered by the unit and any morale effect of the enemy&rsquo;s fire. The assault combat system uses a differential mechanism and results in a more dynamic combat outcome.&#10;&#10;Orders System: A player must first choose one of four possible Orders that an activated Brigade will operate under &ndash; Attack, Defend, March or Regroup. Each Order has specific parameters that provide benefits and restrictions. This Order choice can be critical to a unit&rsquo;s performance during its activation.&#10;&#10;Chit-Pull System: The Blind Swords chit-pull system generates challenging actions and difficult decisions for both players. It features three different types of chits, all of which reside in the same cup, each with special effects:&#10;&#10;Activation Chits = these activate all units of the listed Corps or Cavalry Division. In some scenarios, Activation chits for the French player are fed into the game piece-meal to represent the slow reaction time of the French command structure. But the French player does have some options to speed up this process (see below). &#10;CIC Chits = these are special Activation Chits. The Prussian player has a Chief-of-Staff chit and the French player has a Commander-in-Chief chit. These chits allow players to select any one Division (for the Prussian player) or any one Brigade (for the French player) for activation - even if it has already activated or will be activated later in the turn. Thus, this is the opportunity to activate units twice in the turn. &#10;Event Chits = there are nine Event chits assigned to each player. At the start of a turn, players select any one of these chits to place in the cup (obviously an Event they really want). Three Event chits are randomly thrown out of the turn and will not be used &ndash; the remaining five Event chits are then placed into the cup with the pre-selected chit. In this manner, players are never assured of drawing any particular Event chit, except for the one they initially chose.&#10;&#10;Each Event chit has a Unique Event side (all of which are different) and a Command (or Common) Event side. The Unique Event is tactical in nature and has specific effects and options for the player to consider. Event examples are Auftragstaktik, Krupp&rsquo;s Guns, Beaten Zone, Moulin a&rsquo; Cafe and Battlefield Conditions. The Command (Common) Event side is used for more strategic options. The Prussian player may attempt to speed up his reinforcements and/or change their arrival location and to curtail the effects of the Prussian Aggressive Tactics Event that the French player may play against him. The French player can use his Command Events to hasten his Activation chit availability and to attempt to cancel the effects of the crippling Bazaine&rsquo;s Malaise Event.&#10;&#10;Prussian Strategic Movement: In order to add player input into the strategic off-map movement of the approaching Prussian forces, some scenarios offer the opportunity to use the unique hidden Prussian Strategic Movement system. This involves the Prussian player openly moving units on a special point-to-point map whose results, nevertheless, are hidden from the French player. This will vary where and when the Prussian forces arrive on the map. However, the system is set up so that even the Prussian player cannot be assured of the arrival time or the content of his forces. There will be a solitaire friendly version of this feature, as well.&#10;&#10;MAP&#10;&#10;The map is 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; hexagonal map of the entire west of Metz. Each hex equal approximately 500 yards and contains all the significant terrain details &ndash; elevations, slopes, woods, towns, quarries etc.&#10;&#10;SCENARIOS&#10;&#10;The game includes six scenarios:&#10;&#10;The Afternoon Crisis - a small, limited battle depicting the French advance across the Fond de la Cove on August 16th, 1870. This scenario serves as a teaching experience for new players. &#10;Twilight Of The Guards &ndash; a small, limited battle depicting the fighting around St. Privat on August 16th, which at one point resulted in 6,000 Prussian Guardsmen casualties being inflicted in 15 minutes! This scenario serves as a teaching experience for new players. &#10;The Battle of Mars-La-Tour &ndash; the whole battle beginning at 8:00 am and continuing the entire day. There are two variations offered &ndash; historical and free-setup deployments. There are also options for a historical reinforcements schedule or a variable schedule utilizing the Prussian Strategic Movement system. &#10;The Battle of Gravelotte-St. Privat &ndash; &ndash; the entire day-long battle. There are two variations offered &ndash; historical and free-setup deployments. There are also options for a historical reinforcements schedule or a variable schedule utilizing the Prussian Strategic Movement system. &#10;Campaign Scenario #1 &ndash; the game begins with the Mars-La-Tour scenario but continues past the first day until the campaign victory conditions are achieved.  &#10;Campaign Scenario #2 &ndash; the game begins on August 15th and the French player must march the entire Army of the Rhine across the map to escape to Verdun or, as a secondary option, protect the army from destruction. The Prussian army&rsquo;s movement is done entirely via the Prussian Strategic Movement system until they enter the game map. This scenario gives players the option to shape an entirely new campaign.&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS&#10;&#10;1 &ndash; 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; map&#10;2 &ndash; 9/16&rdquo; countersheets&#10;1 &ndash; Rulebook&#10;1 &ndash; Playbook (Scenarios, Historical Notes and Examples of Play)&#10;1 &ndash; Game Tracks Card&#10;1 &ndash; Prussian Strategic Movement Card&#10;4 &ndash; Player Aids (2 Prussian and 2 French) &#10;4 &ndash; Ten-Sided Dice (1 Blue, 1 Red and 2 White)&#10;&#10;",

        "name": "Longstreet Attacks: The Second Day at Gettysburg",
        "description": "Longstreet Attacks: The Second Day at Gettysburg is a game simulating the fighting on July 2nd, 1863 during the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg and focuses on the southern portion of the battlefield. These engagements involved General Longstreet&rsquo;s attack against Sickles&rsquo; positions, with troops from Hood&rsquo;s and McLaws&rsquo; Divisions, assisted as well by Anderson&rsquo;s Division of A.P. Hill&rsquo;s Corps.&#10;&#10;The game is specifically designed to be a playable regimental-scale game that players can complete in a long evening. It allows the players the immersive experience of tactical combat without the heavy rules overhead normally found in such games, while also delivering a comprehensive experience of limited intelligence and unexpected events. The game features the Blind Swords chit-pull system which emphasizes the three &ldquo;FOW&rsquo;s&rdquo; of military conflict: fog-of-war, friction-of-war and fortunes-of-war. With each chit pull, players will be challenged to make tough decisions based on their assessment of the situation at that moment. Unlike traditional chit-pull systems, the Blind Swords system ensures that no combat units can be counted on, or conversely, counted out. This yields an environment of tense action and constant surprises &ndash; an environment that will challenge each player.&#10;&#10;UNITS&#10;&#10;All regiments and batteries of the Army of Northern Virginia and the Army of the Potomac that took part in these actions are represented in the Order of Battle. Each unit has a Strength Point number, with each point equaling 50 men or 1 artillery piece, and a Cohesion Rating, representing the unit&rsquo;s morale, training and experience.&#10;&#10;SYSTEM HIGHLIGHTS&#10;&#10;Combat and Cohesion System: The combat system is &ldquo;firepower&rdquo; based and utilizes the unit&rsquo;s size and Cohesion Rating to determine its effectiveness. The combat system is driven by a unique four-D6 dice mechanic. All four differently-colored dice are rolled simultaneously. The black and white dice generate an initial result ranging from 11 to 66. The other two dice (red and blue) simultaneously give the players the tangible effect of the initial result and represent physical casualties suffered by the unit (the red die) and the morale effect of the enemy&rsquo;s fire (the blue die).&#10;&#10;Orders System: A player must first choose one of four possible Orders that an activated Brigade will operate under &ndash; Attack, Defend, Maneuver or Rally. Each Order has specific parameters that provide benefits and restrictions. This Order choice can be critical to a unit&rsquo;s performance during its activation.&#10;&#10;Chit-Pull System: The Blind Swords chit-pull system is a unique mechanic and generates challenging actions and difficult decisions for the players. It features four different types of chits, all of which reside in the same cup, each with special effects:&#10;&#10;Division Activation Chits. These activate any one Brigade (not yet activated) from the Division listed on the chit. However, further Brigade activations from this Division are dependent on the Division General&rsquo;s Command Rating and a die roll. A successful die roll places the chit back into the cup and thereby the other Brigades of the Division have a chance to activate in the future.  A failed die roll discards the chit for the turn and the remaining Brigades will not be able to activate normally (however, see below). &#10;CIC Chits.  These are a special kind of Activation Chit. The Union player has a Sickles chit and the Confederate player has a Longstreet chit. These chits allow the player to select any one Brigade in the game for activation - even if it has already activated or will be activated later in the turn. Thus, this is the opportunity to activate a Brigade twice in the turn or activate a Brigade from a Division that has lost its Division Activation Chit. &#10;Event Chits.  There are nine Event chits assigned to each player. At the start of each turn, players may select any one of these chits to place in the cup (obviously an Event they really want). Three Event chits are randomly thrown out of the turn and will not be used &ndash; the remaining five Event chits are also then placed into the cup with the previously pre-selected chit. In this manner, players are never assured of drawing any particular Event chit, except for the one they chose. Each Event chit has a Unique Event side (all the chits have a different Event listed) and a Command Event side. The Unique Event is a tactical event that can be used on the battlefield and each Event has specific effects and options for the player to consider. Examples are Rebel Yell!, Union Logistics, Quick March and Heroic Stand. The Command Event side is used for more strategic options. The Union player may call for reinforcements from the rest of the Army of the Potomac (only the III Corps Divisions are available at start) and the Confederate player can attempt to better coordinate his attack (by increasing his Division General&rsquo;s Command Ratings). &#10;Wild Chits.  These are the two &ldquo;chaos&rdquo; chits. One chit is Fog of War, which can possibly cause units from either side to conduct unexpected attacks or withdrawals, or can cause General officer casualties. The other chit is Fortunes of War which will immediately discard the next chit pulled with no effect &ndash; including that special pre-selected Event chit if it happens to come up!&#10; MAP&#10;&#10;The map is 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; hexagonal map of the entire south end of the Gettysburg battlefield. Each hex equal 150 yards and contains all the significant terrain details &ndash; elevations, slopes, woods, swamps, buildings, orchards, etc.&#10;&#10;SCENARIOS&#10;&#10;The game will include at least five scenarios:&#10;&#10;The Round Tops. A small scenario to introduce people to the games rules.&#10;&#10;The Whirlpool. A ten turn scenario about the most contested part of the battlefield. The Wheatfield, Devils Den, Houck's Ridge and the Peach Orchard. 4:20 to 7:20pm&#10;&#10;Assault on the Emmitsburg Road. A 9 turn scenario of the battle for the Peach Orchard and Cemetery Ridge. 5:40 to 8:20 PM&#10;&#10;Hammerin' Sickles. The full second days action on this part of the field. 14 turns. 4:00 to 8:20 pm.&#10;&#10;Sickles Stays Put. A what if scenario exploring a set up closer to what Meade intended for Sickles before his forward advance.&#10;&#10;Map by Rick Barber&#10;Counters by Charlie Kibler&#10;Box by Mark Mahaffey&#10;&#10;",

Both players have 8 checkers (men) in addition to the common chess pieces.&#10;&#10;The goal of Men Row Chess is different from the goal of the common Chess: a player wins by capturing the opponent's king or stalemating the opponent.&#10;&#10;All chess pieces move the same as in common Chess.  However, two rules are excluded from Men Row Chess: there is no castling or en passante in the game.&#10;&#10;Checkers (Men) move forward or diagonally forward and capture the opponent's pieces by jumping over them the same way as in English Checkers, i.e. diagonally forward only.  A man can capture several of the opponent's pieces in one turn.&#10;&#10;When a checker reaches the last row it becomes a king of checkers.  King of checkers can move diagonally or vertically (forward and backward) and capture diagonally, horizontally and vertically in all 8 directions by jumping over the opponent's pieces.&#10;&#10;Ordinary checkers and kings of checkers are not forced to capture.  I.e. they can stop capturing the opponent's pieces on any step (even if they could capture more pieces) or skip capturing the opponent's pieces altogether.&#10;&#10;",

They can be used either as Candidates (for the post of the Prime Minister), or Agents trying to help their candidate in the elections.&#10;-Threats are the means of eliminating enemy Agents, or even Candidates&#10;-Shelters are for protecting from enemy Threats&#10;-Events are for general purpose, either to hinder your opponents or to earn you points.&#10;&#10;In both variants, each player has his own Candidate for the post of Prime Minister, whose identity is unknown to other players. Those candidates are placed in a column face down and each round ever player puts a card face down in a row with his Candidate. After each player has placed his or her card, all those cards are revealed and resolved in a fixed order (Event, Agent, Threat, Shelter). When a player reveals an Agent, other players may guess the identity of his Candidate. If they guess right, he is revealed and that players cannot gain any points for revealing him by himself. The game continues on, regardless of a successful guess. After a playing a Threat card that will not be neutralized by a Shelte card, that player may reveal his Candidate and earns a number of points corresponding to the game's turn. If all the players' candidates are revealed (either by a guess or willingly) or if number of Threat cards on the table equals to number of players +1, the game ends. The player who caused end of the game gets extra 3 points and each player gets points for surviving of his own and killing opponents' agents.

In the first 28 assignments (each containing 21-28 words/word spaces) your task is to categorize words in their correct word classes. The last 28 assignments (each containing 2-10 sentences) you need to define each word's correct grammar name in the sentence. The answer is given by taking tokens, like for instance &quot;conjuction&quot; and &quot;preposition&quot; (black) or &quot;object&quot; and predicate&quot; (red) and put them on the word space.

        "description": "Strategy board game for 3-5 players where social skills are as important as tactics and luck.&#10;&#10;New York City, April 12th 1985 - Salvatore &ldquo;Big Sal&rdquo; Masserano, head of the DiNero crime family and &ldquo;Boss of all Bosses&rdquo; was shot dead in broad daylight. After two decades of peace and prosperity, the city holds it&rsquo;s breath on the verge of an all out WAR. Now it is time to restore order and take what is yours ...&#10;&#10;Take control of one of the Five Families in a quest to become Boss of all Bosses.&#10;&#10;Players take turns to complete 3 phases:&#10;&#10;1. MONEY&#10;Money is collected at the start of each turn. The bank pays out cash from business sites and when a player advances in rank, he receives some cash from other players as well. Now take a Commission card or an FBI card from the pile in the middle of the board and continue to the POWER (or: action) phase of the game.&#10;&#10;2.POWER&#10;Each turn players can move their pawn up to 5 spaces. As you move around the board, territory is claimed by placing chips on empty spaces. If a space is already claimed by another player, it can be conquered using the weapon cards. Win the battle and replace the opponents token with your own. One can attack using the weapon cards on hand, and / or visit a GANG on the board and pay them to carry out an attack.&#10;&#10;3. RESPECT&#10;At the end of each turn, players can buy cards. This can be business site cards, weapon cards or both. There are 3 types of business, 4 of each type. The more sites you own from one type, the more you earn per site. Business sites are bought from the bank, weapon cards from other players. All weapon cards are sold from the same main stack. Deposit cash for points and finish your turn by moving the tracker chip tot he next player.&#10;&#10;HOW TO WIN&#10;&#10;There are 3 ways to win the game:&#10;&#10;1.    POINTS    The 1st player to reach the top on the score ladder, wins. &#10;2.    MISSION    The 1st player to defeat an assigned opponent, wins. &#10;3.    AREA    The 1st player to have placed all 30 area chips on the board, wins.&#10;&#10;Key to winning GAMBONI is to find the right balance between RISK and REWARD. The game involves tactics, strategy, diplomacy, bluffing, risk taking as well as a portion of luck. One must be agressive and active but know when to stop and whom to attack and whom to keep as a friend ...&#10;&#10;The early bird might catch a worm but the second mouse gets the cheese!&#10;&#10;Each Family has their own special ability, suiting different strategies and personalities (image above, from left to right);&#10;&#10;DiNero (GREEN): Starts with 3 bulletproof vest cards. Special ability: HAND SIZE +2 - Most suitable for defensive players who like to build up before going to war.&#10;Luchetti (WHITE): Starts with 3 consigliere cards. Special ability: BAIL LEVEL -2 - Most suitable for balanced players who don't mind some backstabbing and betrayal.&#10;Montano (RED): Starts with 3 minigun weapon cards. Special ability: WEAPON BUY +2 - Most suitable for aggressive players who like action and don't like waiting.&#10;Borghese (BLUE): Starts with $ 15,000 extra. special ability: DEPOSIT $40k - Most suitable for balanced players who enjoy building businesses and gain power via money. &#10;Garrone (BLACK): Starts with 3 getaway car cards. Special ability: MOVEMENT +2 - Most suitable for players who like to play aggessively and enjoy provoking their enemies.&#10;&#10;",

While traveling the outer worlds, Athilians practice their abilities to manipulate time and space until they become powerful enough to be challenged by the Athilian council to open the portal back to Athlas, thus passing the final test to adulthood.&#10;&#10;As an aspiring god you can design and create your own unique units by enhancing basic Genus cards with powerful abilities, artifacts and spells. You also get to choose divine interventions that might ultimately affect the outcome of the duel. Then you will summon your creations onto the battlefield and attempt to assemble two of three ancient relics in order to open the portal and win the game.&#10;&#10;The game's limitless design system enables players to form any strategy they wish against their opponent's creations.&#10;&#10;",

They had Darrow file for a patent, but knowing the true history of Monopoly they decided to produce their own version of the game. Fortune was the result of this work. As few as 5,000 of these games were made in 1935 before patent 2,026,082 was granted giving Parker Brothers proprietary rights to Monopoly. The name Fortune was then added to Finance which became Finance and Fortune until Parker Brothers used the name Fortune for another game in 1958.&#10;&#10;The main differences from Monopoly are: game board design, hotel color, and that the Property cards seem to be based on the streets of New York City.&#10;&#10;",

The first player whose family tree includes all of the heroic traits necessary for them to complete the saga they're describing wins the game.&#10;&#10;During set-up, each player is dealt a random saga card; these are placed face-up in the middle of the table. Six inheritance markers of the appropriate colors are placed upon the colored icons on the saga card. Each player draws a starting hand of four hero cards. Play proceeds clockwise. Each turn consists of the following phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Catch Your Breath: Draw up to a hand of four cards. &#10;    Embellish Your Story: Optionally use an embellishment for which you meet the qualifications, based on the color of your youngest hero (if one is in play).&#10;    Continue the Tale: Play a card from your hand onto your family tree.&#10;&#10;&#10;Each family tree consists of seven spots and represents the player's heroic lineage. Each hero card possesses a dominant and (in most cases) recessive trait. Traits which match those required by the player's saga may have inheritance markers placed upon them. Once all the player's inheritance markers have been placed on their family tree, they win.&#10;&#10;The player's family tree also allows them to use embellishments matching the color of their youngest hero. If second or third generation heroes of the same color are present, more powerful embellishments may be used.&#10;&#10;",

This game uses the Stand and Deliver Standard Series Rules for tactical warfare from about 1700 to 1799. The Standard Series Rules provide beginning and advanced players with the feel of linear combat of the time while being designed for easy play.&#10;&#10;THE GAME MAP&#10;The 22&rdquo; x 17&rdquo; inch game map represents the general area where the battle was fought around the small Polish village of Mollwitz. Each hex is about 180 yards across. The map is mostly white as there had been a heavy, late snow in April that year.&#10;&#10;COUNTERS AND MARKERS&#10;There are three general types of combat units: foot (infantry and grenadiers); mounted (cavalry and cuirassiers); and artillery. In addition, there are commander units.&#10;&#10;HOW TO WIN&#10;Frederick II and his army were caught behind enemy lines with a large Austrian force lying between him and the rest of his kingdom to the north with his supply and communication lines cut off. The Prussian player wins the game if at the end of the game any Mollwitz Town hex is occupied by Prussian ordered foot units. The Austrian player wins immediately if Frederick II is killed. The Austrian player wins if at the end of the game the Prussian player does not capture at least one Mollwitz hex and at least 6 ordered Austrian infantry units remain on the field. Either side wins if the other should rout. Anything else is a draw.&#10;&#10;SEQUENCE OF PLAY&#10;There are ten game turns. Each game turn consists of the following phases performed in the sequence shown:&#10;&#10;A. Roll for Turn Initiative&#10;Both players roll one six-sided die (1D6). The player who rolls the higher result is the First Player. In the event of a tie, roll again.&#10;B. First Player Phases&#10; a. Ranged Artillery Fire&#10; b. Movement&#10; c. Combat&#10; d. Rally&#10;C. Repeat Above Phases for the Second Player&#10;D. Both Sides Check for Rout; Advance Turn Marker&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Stonewall's Sword: The Battle of Cedar Mountain is a two-player wargame on The Battle of Cedar Mountain, August 9th, 1862. One player commands Thomas &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson's Confederate troops and the other controls Nathaniel Banks' Union troops.&#10;&#10;Players win by controlling key areas of the map and by earning victory points by eliminating enemy units. There are two scenarios available, each with their own victory conditions, length, and aspect of the battle that is focused on.&#10;&#10;Stonewall's Sword: The Battle of Cedar Mountain also features the Blind Swords chit-pull system which emphasizes the three &ldquo;FOW&rsquo;s&rdquo; of military conflict: fog-of-war, friction-of-war and fortunes-of-war. With each chit pull, players will be challenged to make tough decisions based on their assessment of the current situation. Unlike traditional chit-pull mechanisms, the Blind Swords system ensures that no combat units can be counted on, or conversely, counted out. This yields an environment of tense action and constant surprises &ndash; an environment that will challenge each player.&#10;&#10;Charles Kibler created the artwork for the counters and Rick Barber is the artist for the map.&#10;&#10;",

In the West, after the landing in Normandy and forcing German troops to withdraw from France, the armies of the Western Allies stand over the borders of the Reich, being ready to get across Rhine. In the East, mighty Red Army preparing itself to final offensive, which goal is the capital of Nazi Germany, Berlin. Both Allies are set for the race to ultimate victory.&#10;&#10;Players take role of the commanders of the Soviet and Allied armies competing for prize winners: the capital of the Third Reich. Additionally, they command German armies, standing in front of their ally (player directing the Red Army commands German troops on the Western Front and player, who controls the Western Allies commands German troops on the Eastern Front), whose task is to delay their troops on its way to Berlin. In addition, the players has to seize the strategically important regions of Germany, which later will be administered by occupying troops.&#10;&#10;Result of this race creates post-war spheres of influence by the winners of the Second World War, which influence the balance of power during the Cold War.&#10;&#10;Game components&#10;- A map showing areas of Western and Central Europe, where the last battles of World War II took place in 1945.&#10;- Front line markers (2&times;25 pieces), to show the Western and Soviet front lines, which shifted during the operations.&#10;- Logistics blocks (2&times;8 pieces), which form the basis of players&rsquo; military maneuvers on the board.&#10;- Action cubes (2&times;20 pieces), to mark the number of actions made by a logistics block.&#10;- Military unit tokens (40 pieces) with historical markings of armies (Germany, Western Allies) or fronts (Red Army). In the game there are three forces: the Western Allies, the Soviets and the Germans. German units have a current strength, shown by their current orientation. A German unit&rsquo;s current strength is the number on the side facing west (for Western Front German units) or east (for Eastern Front German units). As a German unit takes losses, its block is rotated to show its new status. The West and the Soviets were allied in the war, but compete against each other as players in the game. Germany has no ally, and is divided into the Western Front and the Eastern Front.&#10;- Special action tokens (16 pieces), for use during combat.&#10;- Fortification tokens (16 pieces) in 3 types: improved positions, regular fortifications, and major fortifications. These represent important defensive lines, e.g. the Siegfried Line (Westwall), Pomeranian Wall, etc.&#10;- Victory point tokens (2&times;4 pieces) for areas of crucial importance for military operations (e.g. Essen, Breslau, etc.).&#10;&#10;All game elements are limited by the physical amount provided.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "On the 11th of July, 1899 at 10 a.m., the Union Pacific Express has left Folsom, New Mexico, with 47 passengers on board. After a few minutes, gunfire and hurrying footsteps on the roof can be heard. Heavily armed bandits have come to rob honest citizens of their wallets and jewels. Will they succeed in stealing the suitcase holding the Nice Valley Coal Company's weekly pay, despite it having been placed under the supervision of Marshal Samuel Ford? Will these bandits hinder one another more than the Marshal since only the richest one of them can come out on top?&#10;&#10;In Colt Express, you play a bandit robbing a train at the same time as other bandits, and your goal is to become the richest outlaw of the Old West. The game consists of five rounds, and each round has two phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Phase 1: Schemin' Each player plays 2-5 action cards on a common pile, with the cards being face up or face down depending on the type of the round. Instead of playing a card, a player can draw three cards from her deck.&#10;    Phase 2: Stealin' The action cards are carried out in the order they were played, with a player's best laid plans possibly not panning out due to mistakes and oversights!&#10;&#10;&#10;The game takes place in a 3D train in which the bandits can move from one car to another, run on the roof, punch the other bandits, shoot them, rob the passengers, or draw the Marshal out of position. The train has as many cars as the number of players, and each car is seeded with gems, bags of loot or suitcases at the start of play.&#10;&#10;Each player starts a round with six cards in hand, with each card showing one of these actions. At the start of a round, a round card is revealed, showing how many cards will be played; whether they'll be played face up or face down, or individually or in pairs; and what action will occur at the end of the round (e.g., all bandits on top of the train move to the engine). You can pick up loot, gems or suitcases only by playing a &quot;steal&quot; card when you're in a train car that holds one of these items &mdash; but since everyone is planning to get these goods, you'll need to move, punch and shoot to get others out of your way. You can punch someone only in the same car as you, and when you do, the other bandit drops one of the goods he's collected and is knocked into an adjacent car.&#10;&#10;Each player's character has a special power, such as starting the round with an extra card, playing your first card face down, or pocketing a bag of loot when you punch someone instead of letting it hit the ground.&#10;&#10;You can shoot someone in an adjacent car or (if you're running on top of the train) anyone in sight, and when you do, you give that player one of your six bullet cards; that card gets shuffled in the opponent's deck, possibly giving her a dead card in hand on a future turn and forcing her to draw instead of playing something. If the Marshal ends up in the same car as you, likely due to other bandits luring him through the train, he'll be happy to give you a bullet, too.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, whoever fired the most bullets receives a $1,000 braggart bonus, and whoever bagged the richest haul wins!&#10;&#10;",

The fight seems unfair as the seven of you might not seem to measure up to the dozens of enemies who want to slice you to pieces &mdash; but this comparison doesn't take into account your strong combat skills and an efficient team spirit that binds your samurai squad enough to face the threat. Above all else, when everything seems desperate and lost, your enemies will discover that inside each of you lies a true beast, a warrior spirit ready to unleash its full power!&#10;&#10;Samurai Spirit is a co-operative game in which each player is a fierce samurai defending a village surrounded by a horde of bandits. The game plays out over three turns during which each player takes turns drawing bandit cards, then choosing whether they want to fight the bandit, defend the village, or let the bandit pass in order to help the other samurai.&#10;&#10;The challenge of the game consists of balancing your choices: Should you fight each enemy to quickly reach your beast capacities, while also coming closer to the death and risking further loss by not defending the village sufficiently? Should you mainly defend or help the other samurai, taking the risk of remaining human too long and therefore weaker, when you know that weakness will be a major problem when facing the lieutenant and the villain bosses? Each enemy presents a tough choice to you, your team, and ultimately the whole village! Each turn ends with farms and fences being destroyed, and since those aren't unlimited, you must do what's necessary to end the game with at least one undamaged farm and enough farmers to tend it. Do you have what it takes to stand against evil and become a true hero?&#10;&#10;Fight with courage, smartly assist your teammates, defend the poor villagers, turn into a savage beast, and wreak havoc on the enemy lines &mdash; all of this is up to you! Ultimately it would be your honor to chose to die in a ultimate sacrifice in order to save the village. All of this is what makes the true samurai spirit!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "From the rules:&#10;&#10;UTENSILS. A pack of Red, White and Blue Cards, called Route Tickets, four STEAMSHIPS for travel on the water, and four TRAINS with Engines of color corresponding to the ships, for travel in Europe. It will be noticed that the trains of cars used in playing this game are like the European trains in appearance. Each player should take one STEAMSHIP and one TRAIN OF CARS of the same color. Each player should in turn draw a Red Ticket, without looking at it previously to taking it in his hand, and should put the prow of his Steamship upon the Red spot indicating the City first named on that ticket and from which port he is to sail. When traveling upon the WATER, Use the Steamship ; when going from CITY TO CITY IN EUROPE, each player should use his train as his piece, removing his Steamship from the board as soon as he begins to use his Train, and removing his train from the board when he again uses his Steamship. A player should put the front part of his Train on the City at which he is supposed to be. When ON THE WATER he should use the prow of his ship to indicate his position.&#10;&#10;PLAYERS HAVING MADE THE FIRST MOVE continue in turn to move their pieces to the next place mentioned on their respective ROUTE TICKETS, thus: A player drawing the Route Ticket New York, Storm, Queenstown, Liverpool, and London: will it five moves, reach the latter point (using the Steamship from New York to Liverpool, then removing the Steamship front the board, and playing his Railroad Train from Liverpool to London). A player drawing the ticket New York, Rescue, Southampton and London, will, in four moves, reach the latter City, etc.&#10;&#10;Players who prefer to use ordinary pieces instead of the Steamships and Trains of Cars, may use the four wooden pieces enclosed in the game, but if the Steamships and Trains are used, the wooden pieces are not. As a player moves his pieces, he must call out the place or city to which he moves. When a player reaches the last City named on his Ticket, he throws his Red Ticket aside (as it is not used again in the game), and continues to play and draw front White Tickets until he reaches Constantinople.&#10;&#10;After a ticket has been used it is thrown into a discarded pile or placed under the bottom of the stack from which it was originally drawn. The players, by this process, eventually reach CONSTANTINOPLE, which is the turning point of the game.&#10;&#10;AFTER REACHING CONSTANTINOPLE, a player must draw Blue Route Tickets, which will eventually bring him back to Boston or New York. The player making a TOUR OF EUROPE, as far as Constantinople, and first arriving at the last City mentioned on his return card (either Boston or New York), WINS THE GAME.&#10;&#10;It will be seen that a player may make the trip very quickly, or that it may take a long time. The first Red Card that he draws will take him across the Ocean, but he may have to play upon the cities mentioned on several WHITE Cards before he reaches Constantinople, and he may draw several Blue Route Tickets after reaching Constantinople ere he gets back to Boston or New York.&#10;&#10;N. B. &mdash; Players must move on EVERY City mentioned on EVERY Route Card they draw. Players can only move to the next City mentioned on Their Route Card, in one turn, therefore it will take six turns to reach the last City mentioned on a card having six names of Cities, etc. The red dots on the Ocean, such as Storm, Rescue, Fog, etc., supposed to represent incidents in the ocean trip, are used in the game exactly as the cities are.&#10;&#10;GOING TO DINNER. It sometimes occurs that Two players meet in the same City, in which case they go to DINNER together, that is, both pieces are put upon the Dinner space, or picture, in the corner of the board. Players do NOT remain upon the Dinner space but remove to the next City on their routes (the Dinner only being an incident in their journey).&#10;&#10;It does not require a SEPARATE turn to go to Dinner, the pieces being immediately placed on the Dinner picture on their meeting in any foreign City. Remember that you draw a Red Ticket on the first turn only. The White Tickets are used to carry you to Constantinople, and the Blue ones to bring you home. This will be easily remembered from the order, Red, White and Blue.&#10;&#10;The board (from the 1st edition) sits on top of a wood framed bottom and there is a sliding drawer in the side for the game pieces to go into. The 2nd edition comes without sliding drawer.&#10;&#10;",

Set up begins by randomly laying out a series of rooms that players must progress their pawns through in order to reach the Vault and steal the prized art. Each room has a coordinating color and symbol-coded tool that can be used to bypass the security in that room and move on to the next. But you can use other cards in your thieving arsenal to make vital Hand-Offs, stop your opponents with Security Guards (or pay them off with Bribes), Sabotage your buddies and more!&#10;&#10;Since each of your special thieving techniques requires you to do more than just play the cards (as you make alarm sounds, laugh evilly, and shout &quot;Stop!&quot;), this game of stealth will be anything but stealthy.&#10;&#10;",

But there have always been a few brave souls who have fought to hold it back. They are called HUNTERS. Hunters: Battle of Arkady is a fully cooperative action/horror board game for 2 to 6 players ages 13 and up.&#10;&#10;Hunters: Battle of Arkady uses poker-sized cards to create a dynamic playing board, allowing each game experience to be different. Players then work together to defeat the Arch-Demon Avenastur before the town of Arkady is consumed by darkness. Players have a choice of six characters to play as, each with individual stats and abilities. During the course of play, additional monsters are revealed and must be fought or dismissed as the character's abilities allow.&#10;&#10;Each turn has eight phases, beginning with the character's movement about the board. Avenastur (the Demon) then moves to &quot;chase&quot; the nearest player. If the player has moved, then one or more monster cards are revealed. Once there is a monster in the player's &quot;stack&quot; then the attack/defense part of their turn begins. The player must always roll their attack, depending on the number of d6s their character has, and then roll the attack of the monster who attempts to hit them. Once all the monsters in the &quot;stack&quot; are defeated, the character my Investigate their location. Certain locations have special perks, such as extra lives that can be collected for use by any player, or additional abilities granted to all players. Next the player can regen their health/mana pool as their stats allow. Finally, the Growing Darkness phase flips a location card facedown, losing any special perks remaining, and ending the player's turn.&#10;&#10;The game is won or lost depending on the defeat of the &quot;Main Boss&quot; Avenastur. Killing him wins the game for all the players. However, if the town of Arkady is overrun by the Growing Darkness, the players lose.&#10;&#10;",

We&rsquo;ll call it 'Coinland'.&#10;&#10;'Coinland' is full of coins, one coin per cell with the exception of the central one. Each cell is connected to its neighbouring cells by an edge. The 'Hoarder' will try to collect as many coins as possible by moving from cell to cell, while the 'Gatekeeper' will try to collect coins by &lsquo;taxing&rsquo; the Hoarder, placing gates on the edges between cells and charging a fee each time the Hoarder crosses them.&#10;&#10;Use loose change or draughts pieces or beans or whatever to fill the cells. Keep the centre cell empty.&#10;&#10;The Hoarder uses a chess pawn (or any other object that fits inside a cell). The Gatekeeper uses a marker of a different colour than the edges of the board (if possible). Place the Hoarder piece in the centre cell.&#10;&#10;Starting with the Gatekeeper, players alternate turns during the game until all coins have been collected or the Hoarder is not able to move, whatever happens first.&#10;&#10;On her turn, the Gatekeeper must draw a gate in any edge between 2 cells.&#10;&#10;And on her turn, the Hoarder must move her piece in a straight line to a non-empty cell (it must contain a coin) as many spaces as she wishes in any of the 6 directions. She must pay as many coins to the Gatekeeper as gates she crossed during the move (she cannot move if she doesn&rsquo;t have coins enough to pay). Hoarder collects the coin that is on the destination cell. Moving is mandatory if possible. The hoarder can declare the end of the game after her turn.&#10;&#10;When the game ends, count the coins that the Hoarder has managed to keep. This is her score. Then reverse roles and play again. Whoever achieved the highest score playing as the Hoarder wins.&#10;&#10;",

Intended for use in homes, classrooms, museums, and other science programs.&#10;&#10;Based loosely on Go Fish, the goal is for players to collect as many sets of closely related animals as possible. The sets are &quot;clades&quot; of closely-related animals on the evolutionary tree board, which players use for reference. Players take turns asking another player for cards, and if they do not have a matching card, they say &quot;Go Extinct!&quot;. The gameplay is more strategic than Go Fish because players can ask either for a specific card or a matching card at any level of the tree hierarchy, thus trading off the specificity of the result for the likelihood of a match.&#10;&#10;The game is designed to be fast-paced and fun, while familiarizing players with different animal species, common classifying traits, and the 'nested sets' nature of the evolutionary tree.&#10;&#10;",

When a hexagonal game board is filled, a scoring takes place, with the player who has the most tiles in this board earning 8 points and the player with the secondmost tiles 4 points; after scoring, the active player can rotate this game board as she wishes.&#10;&#10;Once all the tiles have been placed, players then score for the filled hexes created by three adjacent hexagonal game boards, with scoring being the same as for those hexes filled during the game. Whoever has secured the best positions on each game board and rotated her tile to serve double-duty will win!&#10;&#10;",

You will go head-to-head with your opponent, spending valor to dispatch warriors to the front-line to not only deal damage but also defend your life. As in the ancient myths, each warrior has a chosen weapon, which when paired together award bonus powers. Divine scrolls, inspired by interesting characters and stories from the Hindu myths, award you with powerful bonus skills, extra valor, and deadly force to help you take down your opponent.&#10;&#10;Maha Yodha features exquisite traditional Indian artwork, or Pattachitra, as well as specially commissioned illustrations of celebrated warriors and weapons in a visceral modern style.&#10;&#10;",

Equip and upgrade your mining machines, then guide them to the rich mineral seams beneath the ocean. Control the supply of resources to bend the market to your will. Become the master of Nautilus Industries!&#10;&#10;In the game, players take on the role of an enterprising business owner, with each trying to exploit the riches of the sea as well as the marketplace to earn the most money by the end of the game. Players take a series of simple actions, such as programming a mining robot, increasing warehouse capacity, swapping mining zone order, or purchasing stocks.&#10;&#10;Each round, players have three actions they must take before the market phase. During this phase, players collect and sell resources, in turn order. Each sea zone is mined in a specific order, and players have the option each round to sell or hold their resources for a later round. When resources are sold, the market price of that resource decreases to reflect the supply/demand of that resource; stocks of the company using that resource also increase in value. Accordingly, if a resource is not sold, the market price for that resource increases. Players must decide when to sell and when to hold. Should you flood the market to bring down the price so your neighbor makes less money? Do you think the player beside you will hold out for a higher price, or will they sell just to spite you?&#10;&#10;Nautilus Industries is easy to learn because of the simple actions you take, yet dynamic because of the way the markets, stocks, and players affect the gameplay.&#10;&#10;",

Each turn, the player plays a card to move a number of boats, some their own and some belonging to other players. The cards also adjust which lighthouses are lit, and the boats may move only if the lighthouse they are approaching is lit. At the end of each round, the storm move closer to the boats on the board. Any boats caught by the storm are out of the game and will score points for the last lighthouse that was passed. The game ends when the storm reaches the harbor at the end of the twelfth round. Player add the points earned for each of their boats and the highest total wins.&#10;&#10;",

This time, Princess Bubblegum and her NiceLands deck take on Lumpy Space Princess&rsquo;s totally rad dual-Landscape deck in a royal rumble.&#10;&#10;NiceLands Creatures are all about using the damage on them to make them better. Most Creatures are looking for a particular sweet spot of damage. Sometimes you will want to heal damage from your Creatures to get them there. But sometimes you might actually damage your own Creatures to get them to that sweet spot. This new deck not only brings a new Landscape to the mix, but a whole new style of play.&#10;&#10;Lumpy Space Princess&rsquo;s deck is a Useless Swamps and Blue Plains deck. This is the first time a Collector&rsquo;s Pack has featured something other than a mono-color deck. The Useless Swamp side of the deck is themed around discarding cards to power up your Creature abilities. Which is never a bad thing for the swampy side, as they thrive when they have built up a sizable discard pile.&#10;&#10;The Blue Plains side of the deck is themed around replacing Creatures you control. Many of the Creatures in this half of the deck get killer bonuses for replacing Creatures that were already in play. It complements the Useless Swamp desire for a large discard pile as well. Such synergy!&#10;&#10;",

Their survival depended greatly upon not only their skills, but also the quality of their aircraft. Blue Max, the famous game of World War I aerial combat, is back with new graphics and updated rules! In Blue Max, two to six players take the roles of pilots belonging to one of two teams, either the Allies or the Central Powers and aim to shoot down as many enemy planes as possible. With rules that account for altitude, fuel reserves and the maneuverability of your plane, Blue Max places you squarely in the cockpit and you'll need to both master your machine and outwit your foes in order to win. The famous Philip Hall aerial combat game is back with new graphics and updated rules. Components: 1 rule-book, 1 game board (with a map on each side), 6 player screens (3 per team), 18 maneuver charts, 18 plane cards, 144 small size cards, 3 punch boards with 168 cardboard pieces, 60 tracking sheets, 6 custom dice.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Epic Wars is a modular and expandable tile exploration and miniatures skirmish game set in the &quot;Classic&quot; Fantasy genre, with multiple game types and solo, co-op, and pvp modes.&#10;&#10;Miniatures Skirmish - PVP mode:&#10;Traditional tabletop miniatures battle game that can be played on your existing terrain, or on our Wilderness Tiles (sold separately). Each mini will have a stat card with abilities, and players will have event/action cards they can play on their turn. Each mini has an initiative and turns alternate by each individual mini, and NOT by entire squad. Squads are formed by a point system where each squad has a &quot;point pool&quot; and each mini has a cost.&#10;&#10;Miniatures Skirmish - Solo, and Co-Op modes:&#10;Similar to PVP mode with additional movement and &quot;AI&quot; rules (still being tweaked), to allow play against &quot;the game&quot;. The player(s) will determine enemy squad size (point pool), and scenario prior to starting.&#10;&#10;Tile Exploration - Solo and Co-Op modes:&#10;A traditional dungeon tile exploration game with a few differences. Epic Wars will not only have collectable enemies cards with different levels of rarity (different stats, XP, and rewards), but all the dungeon tiles, event cards, treasure cards, trap cards, etc... will have different levels. Players will determine if they want to &quot;free play&quot; or if they want to use a set scenario with different objectives to complete.&#10;&#10;And while the &quot;wilderness tiles&quot; are sold separately, we will be including the &quot;dungeon tiles&quot; in the core game. The main reason for this is many people that play tabletop skirmish games probably already have terrain of some sort, while few will already have dungeon tiles.&#10;&#10;I'm sure this write-up has raised more questions than answered. Our goal is to maximize depth and re-playability. There is nothing worse than getting a game you are excited for and end up playing once or twice because it has the depth of a melted ice cube. Epic Wars is all about expandability and customization. And depending on your luck with the card draws and dice rolls, you could have a wipe after 5 minutes, or an Epic War lasting all day.&#10;&#10;At this time we are still early in design and all elements are subject to change.

Each player rolls a die and moves spaces forward. Lane changes are done once per round during the three longest distances, and the skater changing to the inner lane has priority.

        "description": "Raid &amp; Trade is a post apocalyptic game of negotiation and resource management for 3-5 players. From the ashes of a devastating third World War, a precious few golden cities emerge offering hope to those who struggle for survival in the wastelands. Players explore the ruins of the modern world completing quests, honing their skills and maneuvering for social status in order to claim a precious spot as a citizen with a Golden City. To enter the golden city you must:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Become an expert: Reach 20 skill points.&#10;    Serve the city: Fulfill three secret quests.&#10;    Become a nobleman: Get the most possible character points.&#10;&#10;&#10;In each turn, the players can spend action points to do several actions such as moving through the city, raiding buildings, attacking other players, and more. Each player has a specific skill &mdash; mechanic, trader, electrician, bodyguard and medic &mdash; and has his own unique items to build; those items can be traded off against other items or resources.&#10;&#10;The board of the game is modular so that in every game you have a new map to discover. All over the map, the players find different buildings which they can raid. Each time a player raids a building, a raid card of this type of building is taken and read, which leads to specific circumstances taking place. The player will be made to make various decisions including important moral decisions! Upon resolving the various decisions, you will receive character points. The choices you make, for good or for bad, will lead to specific perks and advantages (or disadvantages) during the progress of the game. When raiding a building, you get resources (tools, scraps, mechanics, electronics, etc.). By combining these resources, you can craft items with special abilities. By doing so, you will advance your skill points.&#10;&#10;Every player also gets secret quests of the golden city. To fulfill these quests, the players have to spend the resources mentioned on the card. To fulfill a quest will not only lead the players closer to victory but also give them advantages for the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Thornwatch is a graphic novel adventure game for 2-5 players and a Judge. Players are manifestations of the Thornwatch: scarred veterans of the Eyrewood who now live as spirits summoned by the ancient ritual of tying a knot of thorns around a birch tree. The Thornwatch summoned to a particular tree do not necessarily know each other or the true nature of the problem they've been called to resolve; all they know is that they've answered the call, and they're bound to see it through.&#10;&#10;Thornwatch bestows upon one player the role of the Judge, who enacts the will of the Judging Wood. Each other player plays a Thornwatch character: the Blade, Briarlock, Greenheart, Guard, Sage, or Warden. The game begins with the Judge selecting a storyboard in which the Thornwatch manifest before a tree adorned with a knot of thorny brambles, surrounded by conflict. If the players overcome this first challenge, the Judge offers choices that lead to new storyboards and further adventure.&#10;&#10;The game takes place on one of many maps that display forests, swamps, and villages of the Eyrewood. The pawns lay flat, as if the heroes, enemies, and denizens of the forest are characters in a set of comic book panels.&#10;&#10;The core engine is the momentum system. This system tracks turn order and monster health, encourages teamwork, and creates dynamic combat with priorities that change turn-by-turn and round-by-round.&#10;&#10;The Thornwatch players each have decks of cards which give them skills and actions, as well as playmats and trait cards to show their unique outlook on the world. They roll custom dice including hero dice gained by manifesting their traits. Each session Thornwatch players have an opportunity to gain knots, which grant their wearer a bonus, regardless of which Thornwatch they choose to manifest in a particular session.&#10;&#10;",

She's lost her dance shoes, teapot, schoolbook, and other valuables, all around the enchanted building. Help her find her prized school supplies, and discover fun lessons from the Good Fairies along the way.&quot;&#10;&#10;This is a hide and seek game for 2 players. Princess Sofia (the seeker) tries to find the supplies that the hider is hiding around the academy. The hider draws from a stack consisting of different supplies, some of Sofia's friends, and a wildcard lucky guess card.&#10;&#10;If the hider draws one of the supplies, it is hidden by having the seeker cover their eyes or look away from the game play area. The hider then hangs the item behind one of the many windows. The seeker then spins the spinner to determine how many &quot;peeks&quot; behind different windows they will get (1-4 peeks are possible).&#10;&#10;If a Sofia friend is drawn, the hider shows the seeker which window the friend is behind, and this encourages the seeker to use their memory so they don't search behind those windows on future turns.&#10;&#10;Lastly, if a wildcard/guessing card is drawn, the hider selects one of the supplies and hides it in their hand. The seeker then gets to guess which item is in their hand.&#10;&#10;Lots of fun for kids as they hide items and use their memory and luck to find the charms.&#10;&#10;",

But to do so, you do not only have to found companies, expand them, and sell them again, you also have to be smart, as knowledge tests are built into the game, and a certain number of knowledge markers is necessary for some of the actions.&#10;Players move around a track; each track field allows a specific action, such as buy/develop a company, get an event card, pay other companies, secure international presence. Players get knowledge tokens by answering design- and print-related questions; these tokens can buy domain-specific knowledge markers which in turn are needed to develop the companies and give an advantage in buy-out attempts. In one sentence, a cutthroat version of &quot;Monopoly meets Trivial Pursuit&quot;.&#10;&#10;This game was developed in the course of a student's project in the faculty of communication design/printing and media at the Technische Fachhochschule Berlin (now Beuth-Hochschule f&uuml;r Technik, Berlin).

        "description": "Game Review&#10;&#10;The glorious S-trio of slimes, spiderlings and skeletons. The first monsters against which your fledgling RPG heroes hone their skills. Slime Adventure: The mystical forest is a card game in which one plays the slimes that evolves against all odds.&#10;&#10;The Components:&#10;&#10;The Slime Adventure: The mystical forest games comes with 97 playing cards and a rulebook in both English and Chinese. Everything is enclosed in a palm-sized box.&#10;&#10;The Cards:&#10;&#10;The playing cards consist of:&#10;&#10;&bull; 1 Naked Gentleman card&#10;&#10;&bull; 10 slime cards&#10;&#10;&bull; 36 Adventurer cards&#10;&#10;&bull; 30 combat cards&#10;&#10;&bull; 20 mutation cards.&#10;&#10;The slime cards dictates which slime represents the player in the game and give the player unique abilities depending on the types of slimes. The backsides of the slime cards also contain a game flow cheat sheet.&#10;&#10;The adventurer cards is the enemy, resource and score counter. Your slime fights them, eats them, digest them and evolve off them !&#10;&#10;The combat cards is the bread and butter of this game. There are three types of combat card representing three different types of attacks that are used by the slimes while fighting.&#10;&#10;The mutation cards are additional special abilities the slimes may acquire after consuming adventurers.&#10;&#10;They make the slime stronger. They are also considered while determining the winner.&#10;&#10;Overall, the anime style artwork and JRPG references are quite appeasing.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;The game comes with a booklet that explains the rules in both Chinese and English. The rules are not too complicated and are well documented in the rulebook with examples and figures.&#10;&#10;Box:&#10;&#10;The box is of the nicely made and of the right size. It is approximately palm-sized but big enough for sleeved cards should you decide to put sleeves on them.&#10;&#10;The Gameplay&#10;&#10;In slime adventure, the players play as slimes with the goal of evolving to be the glorious slime that is ever to be.&#10;&#10;Setup:&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt a random slime card. The adventurer cards are sorted into six decks and ordered according to the numbers on the upper right corner. Each player is dealt 3 combat cards from the shuffled combat deck. The top three cards of the mutation deck are revealed after shuffling the mutation deck.&#10;&#10;Phase of Play:&#10;&#10;Each player can perform the following during their turn:&#10;&#10;&bull; Combat&#10;&#10;&bull; Action&#10;&#10;&bull; Transformation.&#10;&#10;During the combat phase, the player fights the adventurers with combat cards. Should the player win, the adventurer card is \\&quot;consumed\\&quot; and may later be used to purchase mutations. Should the player be defeated, his/her slime is removed from the game and regenerates in the next turn. Other players may also raise the combat difficulties when certain conditions are met.&#10;&#10;During the action phase, the player may move his/her own slime, the adventurer decks or purchase the revealed mutation cards by spending adventurer cards.&#10;&#10;During the transformation phase, the player may discard and refill the cards in his/her hand.&#10;&#10;The game ends whenever&#10;&#10;&bull; a player accumulates six mutation cards&#10;&#10;&bull; less than 4 adventurers remain at the end of any player\\'s turn.&#10;&#10;In the former situation, the player with six mutation cards wins. In the later situation, the winner is&#10;&#10;decided based on the mutations each player has and the adventurers they defeated.&#10;&#10;The Game Design&#10;&#10;The slime adventure is a party game that is easy to learn. However, it also enjoys a satisfactory strategy depth by employing a system where the card placement opens up many different options for the players. Similar to many other games in this genre, one can win either by focusing on progressing toward the victory condition or denying other players. The random components play a huge role in this game, as it should. However, players are not knocked out of the game before the game ends. Hence, \\&quot;poor hands\\&quot; are more bearable. Overall, the slime adventure is quite fun and contains quite some humorous JRPG references. If you like both card games and JRPG, you might want to check this game out.&#10;&#10;",

AlakasSLAM is a micro card game in which you play a sorcerer competing in the most important tennis match of all: the AlakaSLAM!&#10;&#10;Players start with an eight-card hand and use up to three cards per turn to aim, hit, and enchant shots or get extra movement. Careful hand management is key as the cards you use to aim also determine if your ball snags in the net, flies out of bounds, or sets your opponent scrambling. Conserve cards to cautiously build up your mobility, or strike aggressively with powerful enchantments. A well-made shot could spell success &mdash; but miscalculate and forfeit the point!&#10;&#10;The two-player variant focuses on strategic decisions while the four-player variant is more of a short party game of trusting your partner.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Introduction&#10;&#10;Whirlwind is a drawless connection game for two players: Black and White. It's played on the intersections (points) of an even-sized square board. The recommended sizes are between 12x12 and 20x20 points. The top and bottom edges of the board are colored black; the left and right edges are colored white.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, some black and white stones are arranged on the board in an interspersed pattern such that every stone (except those on the edges of the board) is a knight's jump distance away from four enemy stones and a large knight's jump distance away from four friendly stones. Only symmetrical set-ups are allowed. For every board size, two different symmetrical set-ups exist (see the pictures).&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Play&#10;&#10;Black plays first, then turns alternate. On his turn, a player must place one one or two stones of his color on empty points of the board. On his first turn, Black can only place one stone. Passing is not allowed.&#10;&#10;At the end of a turn, any two like-colored, diagonally adjacent stones must share at least one orthogonally adjacent, like-colored neighbor.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Objective&#10;&#10;The game is won by the player who completes a chain of orthogonally adjacent stones of his color touching the two opposite board edges of his color. Draws are not possible.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Acknowledgements&#10;&#10;The ban on diagonal connections as a means to prevent deadlocks on square-board connection games was first used in Corey Clark's Slither.&#10;&#10;",

Careful planning pays off, but when things go wrong you can always go a-viking. On your turn, you either move your ship (to buy and sell goods at cities), or you move the horde (to burn cities), or you move the prince (to rebuild cities).  The goal is to be the richest Viking, with the game ending when someone hits 30 rubles or five cities are burning or all the contracts have been fulfilled.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Infect is a 1-4 player turn based strategy board game where you play the role of an unnamed disease and try to destroy the world. The game features several play mode and levels of play to learn the game at a steadier pace. It features unique strategic elements not seen in other card/board games.&#10;&#10;This game is a mostly card based game but not classified as a trading card game (Like Magic the Gathering) nor a deck building game (Like Dominion). It's a good, plain, draw a card, strategy card game and you have to adjust as the game goes on depending on what you draw.&#10;&#10;The game is played in rounds where each player takes a turn. The turn order unfolds in 7 steps and you play with 5 stacks of cards: Symptoms, Resistances, Transmissions, Locations and Objectives . A basic turn is composed of these actions :&#10;&#10;&#10;    Get your turn's energy&#10;    Draw some cards&#10;    Play the cards in your hand&#10;    Attempt to kill&#10;    Attempt to infect the world&#10;    Complete objectives&#10;    Discard unwanted cards&#10;&#10;&#10;To infect, you must first play cards from your hand that you draw on each turn. Laying down a location makes it possible to infect it, but you also need one or more symptom to make that happen. Getting some transmission vectors and resistances will help you along the way to reduce negative aspects or increase the infectivity of your disease. As the game proggresses, you will play objective cards and complete them to get victory points which will eventually make you win the game.&#10;&#10;",

To do this, they can hop over each other, or even hitch a piggy-back ride.&#10;&#10;However, the wolf is on the loose.

The six-sided die has numbers 1-4, with two sides showing both the 2 and the tractor. In a turn, a player rolls a die and either moves a pig forward, or, if s/he rolled a tractor, may shoot the hay at any of the pigs on the field. If a pig gets hit and moves off its space, it is returned to one of the mudpits and has to start again from there. Pigs may ride piggyback on other pigs.&#10;&#10;The first player to move his/her three pigs to the feeding place is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In AD 1096, hope fills the air like a bird's song after a long winter, the seeming endless road of the Dark Ages may soon come to an end. For years now, warlords have roamed the land, every surface is covered with filth, and disease has ripped through towns like great tornadoes. King Sivolc has dreamed that building a great gothic structure is the answer to leave this Dark Age behind forever. But for the last decade, there has been a massive decline in the building activity, and hardly any great cultural achievements have been made.&#10;&#10;Recently, while on one of his crusades, King Sivolc met a master architect named Elias. Elias told the King about his devotion to the mortar arts and how he longed to build a structure so great that people would travel hundreds of miles just to gaze at it. This meeting created a spark that ignited the King&rsquo;s dream with a fire that would burn away even the darkest of days forever. King Sivolc looks on from his castle and watches with great expectation as his dream becomes a reality.  With Elias&rsquo; help, he has hired some of the greatest architects and monks in the land to complete this task. He waits patiently for this great abbey to be raised from the earth, filled with people, changing the course of history forever!&#10;&#10;The King's Abbey is a worker placement/resource management game in which each player has their own player board that represents the abbey they have been tasked to build. Players take charge of monks that are represented by ten dice as they go out and gather resources, go on crusades, construct buildings, train clergy, bring in peasants, and defend their abbey against the darkness. Each player does this by rolling their dice and then assigning each die (monk) to different places on their player board, resource boards, and crusade cards. The places on the player boards will bring in peasants and train clergy. The places on the resource boards will give them wood, grain, stone, and sand for building the various parts of their individual abbeys.&#10;&#10;Each player receives prestige (victory points) for completing crusades and constructing various things in their abbey such as towers and different kinds of buildings. The game proceeds over a total of seven rounds where the &quot;darkness&quot; becomes greater each round. The darkness represents things like depression, famine, raiders attacking, and other things that the Dark Ages brought with it. You fight the darkness by keeping the defenses of your abbey strong. Players are trying to have the most prestige than any other player by the end of the seventh round.&#10;&#10;After seven rounds, players add up all prestige earned. Whoever has the most prestige wins the game!&#10;&#10;",

The game is packaged in a wedge (&quot;piece-of-pie&quot;) shaped box.&#10;&#10;The game does not feature a game board, and thus, there is no roll-and-move mechanic. Instead, players roll the color-coded die, and answers a question matching the color rolled. If a player correctly answers a question, he may &quot;go for a wedge&quot; by answering another question in the same category. If he does so, he keeps that card. If the player answers a question incorrectly, it is the next player's turn. Play ends when a player has collected six cards/correctly answered 12 questions.&#10;&#10;Is a stand-alone game, or may be used to add questions to Trivial Pursuit: Family Edition.&#10;&#10;",

The quad fold board is slightly smaller than the traditional game, but everything else remains the same. One side of the board is for the game Clue and the other is for the game Parcheesi.&#10;&#10;In Clue, players move from room to room in a mansion to solve the mystery of: who done it, with what, and where? Players are dealt character, weapon, and location cards after the top card from each card type is secretly placed in the confidential file in the middle of the board. Players must move to a room and then make an accusation against a character saying they did it in that room with a specific weapon. The player to the left must show one of any cards accused to the accuser if in that player's hand. Through deductive reasoning each player must figure out which character, weapon, and location are in the secret file. To do this, each player must uncover what cards are in other players hands by making more and more accusations. Once a player knows what cards the other players are holding they will know what cards are in the secret file.&#10;&#10;In Parcheesi, each player has a set of pawns that start in his or her corner of the board. The goal is to move the pawns around the board to the &quot;home&quot; section. Movement is controlled by dice. All players move around the same board, so they may capture each others pawns. Captured pawns are returned to their player's corner and must start their journey over. The winner is the first player to move all pawns &quot;home&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

Bluff your way through history!&#10;&#10;ChronoSphere is a bluffing and historical trivia card game. Players play their cards into a shared circular timeline called the ChronoSphere. Players try to arrange the events and inventions shown on their cards in chronological order, using one half of the ChronoSphere for cards from the time period AD and the other for the time period BC. The first player to successfully play all of their cards is the winner. Players can challenge the plays of their opponents and force them to draw cards for invalid plays. A player can also win by completing a fully valid twelve-card ChronoSphere.&#10;&#10;",

The cards have numbers depicted with numerals and also drawings of humorous characters of the same number.  The cards are shuffled and randomly drawn one at a time, and placed on an empty space on the linen.  If there is a combination of cards in a row equaling ten, vertically or horizontally, that player removes those cards and keeps them.  Otherwise, the card is left in place.  Play continues until all the cards are used.  The player with the most cards wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Dice that are used to capture return to their owner, other dice stay in the horde and continue to be used by other players to try and capture dice.

You are an automaton in possession of several fragments that once held the will of the human race. The other fragments lie in the hands of your fellow automatons. You must investigate and piece together these fragments so that you alone may fulfill the final will of humanity.&#10;&#10;Code of Nine &mdash; first released as Old World And Code Of Nine or OWACON &mdash; is a card-based board game in which the goal is to puzzle together long-gone memories. Players battle for victory points (VPs), but what will generate VPs is decided by eight so-called memory cards that are dealt at the start of the game, with each player getting to look at only two of these.&#10;&#10;Each round, players choose actions that gain certain items such as coins, books, statues or legacies, or perhaps to peek at the other players' memory cards.&#10;&#10;After five rounds, the score is calculated, and whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Six of the colors correspond to question categories while the last color gives a new dice roll. Six spaces along the track are &quot;pie spaces&quot;, and from these there are &quot;spokes&quot; of track leading to the middle of the board.&#10;&#10;Players roll a die and move along the track in any direction they like. When a player stops on a color they get a question of the appropriate category. If the player answers a question correctly while on a pie space, they get a pie of that color (assuming they don't already have it). A correct answer on another square allows the player to roll again.&#10;&#10;Once the player has one pie in each color, she can move along the spokes to the middle of the board to win the game.&#10;&#10;",

The goal of the game is to collect a pie in each color. The colors correspond to different question categories.&#10;&#10;The board consists of a circular track with spaces in seven different colors. Six of the colors correspond to question categories while the last color gives a new dice roll. Six spaces along the track are &quot;pie spaces&quot;, and from these there are &quot;spokes&quot; of track leading to the middle of the board.&#10;&#10;Players roll a die and move along the track in any direction they like. When a player stops on a color they get a question of the appropriate category. If the player answers a question correctly while on a pie space, they get a pie of that color (assuming they don't already have it). A correct answer on another square allows the player to roll again.&#10;&#10;Once the player has one pie in each color, she can move along the spokes to the middle of the board to win the game.&#10;&#10;",

These robots are capable of time travel, mind you, so as you battle for ingredients and supplies, it's possible for your opponent to go back in time and get to them before you do. If you can bake a cake with your robots before your opponent can, you win!&#10;&#10;In the game, players program four robots to move around a modular board and to try to gather ingredients for a cake. The robots are added to the board one by one, as they duplicate via time travel, creating a parallel algorithm of growing complexity. Coordinating the movements as you add more and more robots to the picture is key to solving this puzzle-y game fastest. The game board is created from double-sided cards, allowing for varying gameplay each session with different options on the different sides of the cards.&#10;&#10;",

The goal of the game is to collect a pie in each color. The colors correspond to different question categories.&#10;&#10;The board consists of a circular track with spaces in seven different colors. Six of the colors correspond to question categories while the last color gives a new dice roll. Six spaces along the track are &quot;pie spaces&quot;, and from these there are &quot;spokes&quot; of track leading to the middle of the board.&#10;&#10;Players roll a die and move along the track in any direction they like. When a player stops on a color they get a question of the appropriate category. If the player answers a question correctly while on a pie space, they get a pie of that color (assuming they don't already have it). A correct answer on another square allows the player to roll again.&#10;&#10;Once the player has one pie in each color, she can move along the spokes to the middle of the board to win the game.&#10;&#10;",

The goal of JUX is to create a story by building a collaborative, run-on sentence, inspired by the quirky illustrations. The game takes 5 minutes to learn, and lasts 30 minutes or longer (depending on how much fun you are having).&#10;&#10;Each round begins by revealing a new Objective card and choosing &quot;the best way&quot; or &quot;the worst way&quot; to pursue it. Each player in turn then adds a sentence fragment, using one of their images cards, to extend or to improve the current story - playing off of what others have played.&#10;&#10;A player just created a hilarious twist to the story? Give them a Appreciation Token for their creative contribution. Someone's new addition sounds like the best way to accomplish the objective, instead of the worst way? Challenge their card, and make a convincing argument to your friends. Branch the story onto a new path to take the tale in a new direction. Think up a creative ending to the collaborative story to finish the round. All will gain you Appreciation Token, an acknowledgement for your creative thinking throughout play. Collect the most Appreciation Token to become the Best Storyteller!&#10;&#10;",

If the question is answered correctly, the card is kept, and the person with the most number of cards after 5 or 10 minutes is the winner.&#10;&#10;From publisher:&#10;&#10;This exciting addition to our BrainBox range enables children to create their own unique BrainBox game. Each card shows a different scene as a line drawing, ready for children to colour in. Coloured pencils are included, but felt-tips could also be used. Some of the questions on the cards will have different answers, depending on the child's choice of colours, and the final question is left for children to write themselves. Encourage your child's creativity, memory and observation skills with this great game.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In Bucket King 3D, a new version of Stefan Dorra's The Bucket King, players lay down sets of animal cards to try to knock over every other's pyramids of buckets. Cards in hand can be used to defend your own buckets and attack those of others &mdash; and if you knock out a bucket low in someone's pyramid, you might cause a cascade that takes out even more!&#10;&#10;Each turn, the active player either plays cards or loses buckets; the game is played in rounds with a new round starting after anyone loses one or more buckets. At the start of each round, the active player chooses 1-3 cards in hand of the same color/animal, lays them face up in front of himself, announces their sum, then draws one card to add to his hand (regardless of how many he played). Each subsequent player must lay down 1-3 cards of the same suit as the initial player with a higher sum than previously announced or else lose a bucket. (If play circles the table to the round's start player, he can add 1-3 new cards to those previously played, then announce the sum of all cards in front of him.)&#10;&#10;When a player cannot or chooses not to defend his pyramid by playing cards, he removes one bucket of that card color from his pyramid by pushing, flicking or poking it with only one finger. (If he doesn't have a bucket of the required color, he removes a bucket of his choice.) This player then starts a new round after everyone has cleared their played cards.&#10;&#10;In a two- to four-player game, the game ends when a player loses his last bucket; in a five- to six-player game, a player who loses his last bucket is out of the game, and the game ends when only three players have buckets still in play. Whoever has the most buckets remaining in his pyramid wins.&#10;&#10;Bucket King 3D includes 2 variants for experience players: &#10;(1)Play with the Special &quot;One&quot;!&#10;Whenever a player lays down a 1 while playing cards of the appropriate color, he can also play one other card of any color, adding the value of that card (and any others played) to his sum; he then draws two cards (one as normal, plus another card for the bonus card played) to end his turn. For example, if the required suit is blue, he may play a blue 1, with a red 4 as the additional card, announce his sum as &quot;Five&quot;, then draw two cards from the deck.&#10;&#10;If he plays two 1s, then he may play two additional cards of any color and draw three cards at the end of his turn. A player can lay down at most five cards.&#10;&#10;(2) Play with the Backfiring Discard!&#10;This variant is played with all the basic rules, but the direction of play may change during the game!&#10;When the active player plays cards to attack on his turn, the direction of the play is reversed if he plays an additional card of the same colour onto the discard pile. He draws cards as normal for the cards he has played in front of himself, but he does not draw any card for the additional card he has played.&#10;For example, a player has played a Blue 4. The next player plays a Blue 5 in front of himself and discards a Blue 2. Then he draws only 1 card. The direction changes now and play continues with the previous player.&#10;You may play both variants (1) and (2) in the same game! For example, a player may play a Blue 1 and a Red 7 in front of himself (variant 1) and the direction of play remains unchanged. But if he plays a Blue 1 and a Red 7 in front of himself (variant 1) and discards a Blue 2 (variant 2), the game continues in the reverse direction.&#10;&#10;",

The board is oriented with a side of six cells next to each player. These nearest six cells are called the &ldquo;bank,&rdquo; and to start the game, each player has six pieces called &ldquo;men&rdquo; in his own color, one on each cell. In the next two rows, referred to as a &ldquo;mooring,&rdquo; each player starts with twelve &ldquo;boat&rdquo; pieces of his own color. These pieces are large enough for the &ldquo;men&rdquo; to easily stand upon.&#10;&#10;Players take turns moving one piece at a time, man or boat. Men may move any number of spaces vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, but not back towards their own bank. Between banks, men may only move about on or over boats. Only one man may ride a boat at a time. Boats move in the same manner as men. Men may ride a boat of either color, but the boat&rsquo;s rules of movement do not change. Men may not be removed from a boat of their own color, but may be thrown overboard from one of their opponent&rsquo;s boats.&#10;&#10;Men may throw the other player&rsquo;s men overboard by landing on or jumping over their boat. To do this, the opponent&rsquo;s man must be in an adjacent cell; the capturing player must land on that boat or land on an empty boat opposite. A man thrown overboard returns to any empty cell on his player&rsquo;s bank and begins again.&#10;&#10;When a boat and man reach the opponent&rsquo;s mooring, they are permanently removed from the board. The first player to remove all his own pieces from the board wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

You can stockpile as many goods as you want before returning to port, but taking on too many goods will reduce your vessel's speed. Players must be realistic about the port they can reach before their rivals are upon them.&#10;&#10;The ships in Merchant Marine act like large ships should -- they are hard to stop and cannot turn on a dime. Players must wrestle with these limitations even while exploiting the same weaknesses in their rivals. Run down another player to steal their precious cargo for yourself, or raise your sails in a desperate bid to outrun a more encumbered vessel.&#10;&#10;The player with the most points when the final load of goods has been recovered from the sinking ship is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In Business Mogul you play as the leader of a rising corporate empire, competing with your peers to amass the most power. Game play is centered around building an economic engine, and uses a bidding mechanic where players must balance bids to get the good stuff and to avoid the bad against the actions needed to build their empire, while saving high bids as much as possible to convert to cash at the end of each season.&#10;&#10;The game has a fixed number of turns - six seasons of five rounds each - and total play time tends to be about 2-2.5 hours for 4 people (the game is designed for 3-5, with a solid 2-player variant), on par with a feature movie. In every round there is one card per player up for grabs - every player gets a card every round. The cards on which players bid are businesses that are used to build up your economic engine, extra actions to be saved until needed most (and they let a player do some things outside the normal rules of play), special agenda cards that give score a bonus at the end of the game (how much depends on how well the conditions for the given card are fulfilled), and bad events (which are to be avoided if possible).&#10;&#10;Players are bidding pick order rather than on a particular item. Each players uses a set nine of bidding cards (getting them all back at the start of each season), which represent how the player is dividing their attention that round between trying to get the best of the available items and getting other stuff done. Each bid has a specific action that it allows (lower bids have more powerful actions), and bids saved for the end of the season are worth extra money - the higher the bid the more it&rsquo;s worth. These additional aspects associated with each bid, the action and the end-of-season cash value, make for exciting, meaningful choices every round.&#10;&#10;Business Mogul supports multiple valid strategies, though the highest final score usually goes to the player that dabbles in additional strategies beyond their primary one. The key to winning is being tactically smart about balancing pick order vs action vs end-of-season-payout, paying attention to the state of other player&rsquo;s empires and the bids they've already used in the current season, and executing a strategy that adapts to the flow of items up for bid.&#10;&#10;There are some fairly common game mechanics/attributes that Mogul specifically does not have:&#10;&#10;- It has no player-to-player aggression - the bidding each round is the only point of direct competition. &#10;- It does not have random action outcomes (that is whether or not a given action succeeds is not determined by dice, card draw, or anything like that). &#10;- It does not have any kind of territory control. &#10;- It has no resources / production beyond money and end-game score.&#10;- It does not require memorization of what&rsquo;s been played; aside from a single hidden card each player gets at the start and the particular bid a player is making in a given round, the state of the game is fully revealed.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Block Party is a game that delights and challenges active minds. Players race to find patterns of icons called Parties. Parties are highly symmetric collections of icons which tickle the brain. With simple shapes and pleasing colors, Block Party brings out your playful side and gets your wheels spinning from the first &quot;Party!&quot;&#10;&#10;Features gameplay borrowing attribute matching mechanics like those found in Set and Qwirkle, a tiny number of components (can be played with only 8 wooden blocks), and dozens of variations to vary the game duration, number of players, cooperation or competition, and age range (easier variations for young players and harder ones for masters).&#10;&#10;How to Play: Block Party Classic&#10;&#10;Block Party can be played with 1-6 players for as long as they like. Players simultaneously search for parties (symmetric collections of four icons, see below for more), shouting &quot;Party!&quot; when they find one, after which they put it together to show the group and flip the four blocks used.&#10;&#10;For a more finite and competitive version, players can keep score (often with tokens or Block Party cards) where the first player to 10 parties wins. This number can be changed to alter the duration of the game, or set per player to handicap and make for a fair race.&#10;&#10;",

Four lines of small holes extend vertically and horizontally from the pit to the sides of the board, and continue around all four sides making a border.  Near each corner of the board are four more small holes.  Printed on the board over the lines of small holes are the outlines of footprints leading in one direction, ultimately towards the hideout.  Printed over the groupings of four holes are a bomb, a noose, a gun, and a knife.&#10;&#10;Four players have four pegs each in their own color.  Play begins with their four pieces resting in one of the four corner groupings.  Players take turns rolling a six-sided die to determine the length of their move.  Any one of the player's pegs may be moved, but most be moved the exact number of footprints rolled on the die.&#10;&#10;If landing on a hole occupied by another player, the first peg is returned to its home base to begin again, and the peg in play is moved five extra spaces.  Players may not land on a footprint occupied by one of their own pegs; they must choose to move a different peg.&#10;&#10;The hideout may only be reached by an exact roll of the die.  If no other moves are possible, that player forfeits the turn and the peg remains in place.  The first player to move all four pegs into the hideout wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

For every question card, there is just one matching answer card. There is also one joker and one jack-in-the box -card. There is two rule sets in the game.&#10;&#10;In the first game you just deal out the cards. Joker is removed. Everybody then removes matching pairs from their hands. Then the player in turn takes a card from the previous player. If the card matches a card in the players hand, he/she reads it loud and removes the pair. Then it's next players turn. This goes on until cards run out. Winner is the player who gets rid of his/her cards first and the loser is the player holding the pairless jack-in-the-box when pairs run out.&#10;&#10;In the other game you just deal out the question cards. Joker and the jack-in-the-box are removed. Answer cards are shuffled and put in the table. One player then turns up the first card from the answers deck and reads it out. The player with the matching question reads it and then discards it. Then you read out the next answer card. Winner is the player who first gets rid of his/her cards.&#10;&#10;",

The cards are divied into eight suits (A, B, F, L, O, R, S, U) with eight cards per suit (HIGH, DOUBLE, 4, 3, 2, 1, TWIN, LOW). Two other cards are included, the ROYAL E and a WILD card, each of which have a rank of 0 when necessary.&#10;&#10;The 34 page rulebook describes seven games:&#10;Regular Tilt&#10;Reverse Tilt&#10;Double Tilt&#10;Royal Tilt&#10;Chain Letter&#10;Vocab&#10;Tilt Crossword Solitaire&#10;&#10;The Tilt family of games are trick-taking games where certain ranks are worth 1 or 2 points. One suit per player, plus one extra for a dummy hand, are used. Players bid for the right to name a trump suit, and the winner draws two cards from the dummy to improve his hand (and discarding two unwanted cards). The different versions change the rules or scoring in various ways.&#10;&#10;Chain Letter is a stops-style game where players try to discard their hand by matching the last-played card. Only suits count, not ranks.&#10;&#10;Vocab is a spelling game where players use the cards as letters, trying to make three-letter words. The TWIN cards count as two letters, so TWIN L is LL, TWIN A is AA, etc.&#10;&#10;Tilt Crossword Solitaire is as it sounds, a solitaire game where the player fills an 8 by 8 grid with cards. Points are earned for letters in words or abbreviations, while they are lost for empty spaces in the grid.&#10;&#10;The game and rulebook are copyright 1946 by William H. Mulder. The place of publication is Grand Rapids, Michigan. No manufacturer is listed.&#10;&#10;",

The player who has collected Soul cards of all 3 types, 3 Soul cards of the same type, or 5 Soul cards of any type wins the game.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#226;&#150;&#160;How to play&#10;&#10;Play a Hunter card from your hand face down on the Angel or Devil team side.&#10;After all players pass their turns or the maximum number of Hunter cards playable (as shown on the Soul card) are played, flip all played Hunter cards face up. &#10;Add the strength of the cards on each team side (Angel and Devil) to calculate the total strength of each team.&#10;The player who played the Hunter card with the lowest number in the team with higher strength shall receive the Soul card of that round.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#226;&#150;&#160;Point&#10;&#10;In this game, you need to play a high-number card(s) to form a majority and a low-number card(s) to outdo other players in the majority.&#10;The point of this game lies on how you handle this dilemma.&#10;&#10;",
