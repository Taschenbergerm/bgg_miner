        "description": "Wands is a fast-paced fantasy card battle for two to five players, combining elements of Uno and Magic: The Gathering.&#10;&#10;You play the role of a witch or wizard, engaged in a magical battle with your opponents.  You and your rivals start with 10 life points each.  Using a combination of Blasts (unblockable magicks), Spells, and Counter-Spells, you try to reduce your opponents to zero life points and be the last spellcaster standing.&#10;&#10;If you cast a Spell, opponents have a chance to cast their Counter-Spells.  Multiple Counter-Spells can be cast on each other, adding more damage and greater effects, shifting effects, or canceling them altogether.  Imagine one of the wand battles from the Harry Potter movies and you get the idea.  It's quite fun to cast a spell on your buddy, watch someone shift the effects to someone else and add to it, watch someone else shift the effects to yet another player, watch someone dispel that shift, watch the next person dispel that shift, and finally, you shift it back to the original target.&#10;&#10;Wands is best with two to five players.  Games can be as short as a couple of minutes, and it shouldn't take more than ten minutes for anyone to learn the rules.&#10;&#10;Wands is not a collectible card game.  You only need one set of cards; there's nothing to collect; no booster packs; no rarity; no drafts.  This is the full game.&#10;&#10;",

The compartments each ship has are up to the players, who must strike a balance between offense, defense, repairability, and command.&#10;&#10;Players start the game by drawing ship compartment cards from the deck. Each ship compartment can take a certain amount of damage before it is destroyed. When a ship compartment is destroyed, it is discarded. Part of the strategy of Starship Battles lies in how one chooses to manage battle damage.&#10;&#10;As the turns progress, players attack one another using their weapons, defend themselves using their shields, change their attacks or defends using command points, and repair damage using engineering capability.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "American baseball was on its last legs as a spectator sport. Football had become the predominant national pastime &mdash; that is until the year 2032, the year baseball decided to revolutionize the game and regain the throne!&#10;&#10;Starting in 2032, baseball games were shortened to six innings. Pitchers were encouraged to have bionic arm implants to improve their pitching. These cyborgs, or 'Borgs as they're affectionately known, were immediately popular and soon ruled the league. In 2041, robotic players were introduced to get more offense back into the game. These robots were similar to designated hitters in that they were used only to bat and did not field. However, recent reports indicate fielding 'Bots are on the way.&#10;&#10;Now in 2045, human players are still in the game and known as Naturals. They are the best fielders by far but are sorely challenged when it comes to hitting and pitching. Some Naturals have learned to hit by swinging before the pitcher starts his windup, which gives them a chance to hit the ball. Although it's hard for a Natural to get into the league, those who do are popular. Many Naturals have named themselves after the great players of pre-2032 baseball by taking a first and last name borrowed from different star players of the past. The fans love them, and their presence on the team ensures good revenue!&#10;&#10;The stage is now set! The fans are energized and root fanatically for their new favorites, be they 'Bots, 'Borgs or Naturals!&#10;&#10;Baseball Highlights: 2045 is like watching TV&nbsp;highlights of early 21st-century baseball games, with the gameplay being full of theme with no outs or innings and without bogging down in a play-by-play baseball simulation. In this quick and interactive game, two players build their teams as they play, combining both strategy (building your team) and tactics (playing the game) without any of the downtime. During each &quot;mini-game&quot;, each player alternates playing six cards to simulate a full game's highlights. The mini-game includes defensive and offensive actions, and your single card play may include elements of defensive and/or offensive plays. Do you try to thwart your opponent's pending hits, put up strong offensive action of your own, or use your better players to do both? Players buy new free agents after each mini-game to improve their roster, and the team who wins the most mini-games in the series is the champ!&#10;&#10;The contents of Baseball Highlights: 2045 box is:&#10;&#10;1 rulebook&#10;&#10;4 stadium mats&#10;4 reference sheets&#10;&#10;120 cards:&#10;&#10;     60 starter cards&#10;     60 free agent cards&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;60 wooden pawns:&#10;&#10;     20 red&#10;     20 white&#10;     20 blue&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;12 cardboard markers:&#10;&#10;     4 triangular markers (visitor/home)&#10;     8 circular markers&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

One day, the whelp came to this realization: if he is destined to grow up to become a mighty Dragon, a force powerful enough to threaten possibly even the world's existence, what use does he have for such trinkets?&#10;&#10;And so begins the Battle for the Boss Medallion: a contest/game in which the dragon whelp has granted the opportunity to earn a Boss Title to one of the dungeon world's lowest inhabitants, the Slime!&#10;&#10;(The competing Slime lieutenants (the players) each have 10 health and take turns playing their Slime minions (cards) onto the Play Pile following rules similar to the card game B.S. Whenever a lieutenant's Bluff is called, a duel follows, with the loser taking damage from the recently played Slime Minions. These tactics and blows are exchanged until only one lieutenant is left standing to claim the whelp's Medallion!)&#10;&#10;Summary and Additional Notes:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Bluffing card game with Slime Combat!&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Each deck features a different color mix of slimes.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Jokers and Slime abilities add even more strategy to the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Kids make signals out the back window, just hoping to hear that horn blast away as the trucker goes by and we benefit everyday from these massive machines moving goods and materials from coast to coast over the maze of our highways.  Hauler is a game dedicated to the Big Rig Trucker in all of us!&#10;&#10;Hauler is a game for 2-5 players where the goal is to build a deck of resources that will give you the most victory points.  VPs are earned on cards or by running routes off of route cards purchased with Green Stamps (Money in Trucker Lingo).  Green Stamps are earned playing cards out of your hand each turn.  Green stamps can be used on your turn to purchase route cards, truck cards, fuel cards or action cards.&#10;&#10;The rules of the game are complex.  Think of Hauler as part deck builder and part strategy board game.  Each turn a player can drive up to 12 hours each turn per truck or you draw 5 cards from their deck and purchase additional cards based on the green stamp value of the cards in play. Of course, there are complications and strategy to be had, as other players may be eyeing the same route you just passed on picking up, or may get to a hitchhiker before you if you take an extra deckbuilding turn. The decision is yours, and makes for great strategic conundrums in this 90-120 minute game.&#10;&#10;",

King, Queen, and Hunters show their role card, Werewolves and Vampires don&acute;t show it. First the King will draw one of the two cards of Gods (Favour of the gods or No Favour of the gods). Afterwards the King will order hunt Werewolves or Vampires. Hunters will think first to retire or not to retire. If they decide to hunt, they must fight with the beast orders by the King. Queen will be a partnership of the King.&#10;&#10;",

Construction picks up as the wind dies down.

Tornadoes not only affect the trailer parks, but they can also force players to move positions at the table, make them trade hands, or even Invoices, with other players!&#10;&#10;You'll never know what's coming down the line regarding tornadoes.  During Set-up, you randomly and secretly select tornadoes to remove, and as you cycle thru the draw deck, you randomly and secretly remove additional tornadoes, so the tempo builds, the tension grows, and the game comes to a quick victory.&#10;&#10;",

The more you attract, the more likely monsters will attack!&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Overview&#10;&#10;Hire and train your workers, build and upgrade your attractions, and convince your battle weary heroes to fight just one more time so without letting too many tourists get eaten! Gain Victory points by upgrading attractions and giving Heroes the rest they need. The highest scoring player when all monsters are defeated is the winner.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Setup&#10;&#10;Each player begins with a humble resort consisting of a Beach, a Tiki Hut and a small number of Tourists, placed at each attraction. Each player starts with their own worker Deck consisting of 7 Apprentices, 3 Street Performers, and 3 Lazy Peons.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Gameplay&#10;&#10;Each round consists of 4 phases:&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Phase I - Get to Work&#10;&#10;&#10;     Each Player draws a hand of 5 Workers from their Worker Deck.&#10;     Players simultaneously send worker cards from their hand to do work at each of their Attractions. Any missing units of work (are required by the Attraction) cause Tourists to leave before gathering resources.&#10;     Players gain the primary resource of Gold by having more tourists at each attraction, and Flair by having less tourists. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Phase II - Action: Attract, Hire &amp; Upgrade&#10;&#10;In order, players take one action per turn or pass. Players will be interacting with common draft areas, as well as using abilities from their own workers and attractions. Possible actions include:&#10;&#10;     Attract Tourists from the Dock (Spending Flair) - Tourists are placed at attractions, potentially increasing the Gold gained on the subsequent turn.&#10;     Attract a Hero from the Dock (Spending Flair) - Heroes start with low health, which is gained at the end of each round. Fully Rested Heroes are scored for Victory Points.&#10;     Upgrade an Attraction (Spending Gold) - Providing higher tourist capacity, better Gold payout, better abilities and more Victory Points. Upgraded attractions typically require more workers to keep them fully staffed.&#10;     Train or Hire new Workers (Spending Gold) - Upgrade your workers to provide more work, or better abilities. Training locks a worker draft pile, preventing other players from upgrading to that particular worker during the round. Training workers is a 1-for-1 exchange, keeping players' Worker Deck lean by design. &#10;     Pass - The first Player to Pass becomes the Start Player for the next round&#10;&#10;&#10;Any time during a player's turn, he may use abilities from fully-staffed attractions, or discard worker cards to use their unique abilities.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Phase III - A Ship Arrives&#10;&#10;The dock is refilled with new Heroes and Tourists from a center pile. While refilling, it's possible to trigger a Monster Attack!&#10;&#10;     If an Attack! card is revealed, the top Monster from the Monster Pile will choose which player it's attacking; typically by Most Tourists or Most Heroes at their resort, ties broken clockwise from the start player.&#10;     If a Hero defends against a Monster Attack, he loses 1 health. Any undefended damage causes tourists to be eaten by the Monster.&#10;     Heroes may dodge into, or out of, a Monster Attack up to one time per round.&#10;     If an attraction has no Hero or Tourists, a Monster will Damage it, potentially destroying the attraction.&#10;     A player may chose (if they have one) to throw a Lazy Peon at the monster, ending the attack and permenantly removing the Worker Card from the game.&#10;     The Dock Continues to refill, potentially triggering more Monster Attacks, until it is full.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Phase IV - Clean Up&#10;&#10;&#10;     Used and unused Workers are placed in players' discard piles.&#10;     Any fully-rested Heroes are scored - Placed to the side, each worth Victory Points at the end of the game. This Hero also removes the top Monster from the remaining Monster Deck.&#10;     Remaining Heroes gain 1 Health each.&#10;     Any Locked Worker Draft Piles and Attraction Abilities are made available for the next round.&#10;     Any unused Flair is sent back to the supply. Gold carries over to the next round.&#10;&#10;&#10;Gameplay continues with Phase I&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Game End&#10;&#10;If at the end of the round  there are no Monsters remaining, the game is over and players total Victory Points from Attractions, Scored Heroes, and 1 point for each remaining Hero at their resort. The player with the highest Victory Point total has built the most Epic Resort and is victorious!&#10;&#10;",

First we check for ties. The tie numbers are gone and then the highest card wins. Cards are 1 to 6. Four times per card.&#10;&#10;If after the first check we have a 1 card and a 6, then the 1 card wins the trick.&#10;&#10;So now all keep the winning trick cards and we are ready for phase 2.&#10;&#10;Phase 2 is Russian roulette, a game of chance. We have 6 cards (bullet cards) in the middle of the table, as a revolver. 5 empty chambers and one with a bullet.&#10;&#10;On your turn (beginning with the player with the most cards from phase one): &#10;You can draw a card (pull the trigger) or you can discard one card from that you collect before, to shuffle all open bullet cards back together and then draw one, you just spin the cylinder of the revolver, (no point to do it if you have to draw the first bullet)&#10;or you can discard as many cards as alive players in the game to pass your turn to the next player.&#10;&#10;When you draw we check if you die or live from the bullet card.&#10;If you stay alive the game continues to the next player. If you die we shuffle the bullet cards and continue with the player with most cards.&#10;&#10;Last man standing is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "A traditional Japanese trick-taking card game based on the European game Ombre (originally &quot;l'Hombre&quot;), played with a special 75-card five-suited deck. This deck developed from Tensh&#197;&#141; karuta, itself a close copy of the 48-card traditional Portuguese cards called &quot;dragon cards&quot; due to the dragons holding the suit symbols in the aces. Its creation was prompted by a ban on the older form of playing cards after Japan closed off the contact with the Western world in 1633, and became critical towards everything of European origin. Sunkun karuta took this game one step further.&#10;&#10;The deck contains all 48 cards from Tensh&#197;&#141; karuta; these are supplemented by introducing a fifth suit and increasing the number of cards in each suit from twelve to fifteen. Most additions refer to Japanese and Chinese culture, presumably a conscious choice intended to downplay the European origins of the game.&#10;&#10;The suits are &#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#134; (hau), &quot;flower&quot; based on Portuguese 'paus' meaning &quot;clubs&quot;, &#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#153; (isu) a shortened form of 'espadas' or &quot;swords&quot;, &#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#183; (koppu) from 'copas' or  &quot;cups&quot;, &#227;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#139; (&#197;&#141;ru) from 'ouros' or &quot;coins&quot; (literally &quot;golds&quot;) and finally the added &#227;&#129;&#144;&#227;&#130;&#139; (guru) with the traditional Japanese &#228;&#184;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#229;&#183;&#180; (mitsudomoe) sign as suit symbol. As in the European predecessor games, higher-numbered pip cards beat lower ones only in the former two suits, while the latter ones are &quot;reversed&quot;.&#10;&#10;The &quot;dragon aces&quot; are split into two distinct ranks by reintroducing a normal &quot;one&quot; in each suit and separate from the &#227;&#130;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#132; (robai) or &quot;dragon&quot; which normally ranks right above the ones. Above the number cards (1&ndash;9 plus robai) there are five court cards. From low to high, these are: &#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#159; (s&#197;&#141;ta) &quot;queen&quot;, &#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#190; (uma) &quot;horse&quot;, &#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#138; (kiri) &quot;soldier&quot; (originally a king), &#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#147; (un) various Japanese mythological figures and &#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#147; (sun) various Chinese officials. The latter two ranks give the game its name. In the trump suit, the robai is promoted to above the kiri and the s&#197;&#141;ta above this again, except that the robai of hau is a permanent trump which is the fourth highest regardless of which suit is trump.&#10;&#10;",

The game ends when a player runs out of money.&#10;&#10;How to play: every player take 10 houses (14 for 2 players). Every player takes 5x1000, 4x2000, 3x3000, 1x4000 1x5000. Players roll the dice to move.&#10;&#10;If movement ends on a space without house: the player pays the bank the sum written on the space and becomes the owner. Players that end their turn on this space pay the owner the same sum. If the owner owns all houses on spaces of the same color the sum will be double.&#10;&#10;If movement ends on the GO space: the player takes 2000 from bank.&#10;&#10;If the movement ends on STATION space: reroll the dice and move again.&#10;&#10;If the movement ends on RISK space: draw a card from the deck and follow the instructions.&#10;&#10;If the movement ends on CAKE and BALLOON space: the player puts 2000 on LOTTERY space.&#10;&#10;If the movement ends on LOTTERY space: the player takes all money on the space.&#10;&#10;If the movement ends on GO TO SHOOTING GALLERY space: the player puts 3000 on LOTTERY space and goes on SHOOTING GALLERY space without passing the GO space.&#10;&#10;RISK cards with HOUSE written: the player puts his house on a same color space written on card. If all of the same colour boxes are occupied by one player, the player has to draw another card.

        "description": "&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Introduction&#10;&#10;Veletas is a drawless territory game for two players: Black and White. It is played on the spaces (squares) of a 10x10 checkered square board, which is initially empty. Apart from the board, the necessary material comprises seven shooters and a sufficient number of black and white stones.&#10;&#10;Both players control a number of neutral red pieces and shoot stones of their own colour from them. In order to win, a player must claim a majority of neutral pieces by having them surrounded by larger groups of their own pieces than their opponent's.&#10;&#10;This game won (along with Four) the BoardGameGeek Best Combinatorial 2-Player Game of 2013 Award.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Definitions&#10;&#10;A piece is a shooter, a black stone or a white stone.&#10;&#10;A group is a set of one or more like-colored, orthogonally adjacent stones. The size of a group is the number of stones in it. Stones on top of shooters are not part of any groups.&#10;&#10;A trapped shooter is a shooter that cannot make any legal move in the current position.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Play&#10;&#10;The first player begins by placing three shooters and one black stone on empty squares of the board. The second player then chooses which player will be Black and which will be White. Next, White places the remaining four shooters and one white stone on empty squares of the board. In both cases, no shooters can be placed orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to any other shooters. This restriction does not apply to the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;From then on, the players take turns, starting with Black. On your turn, you may (but are not obliged to) move a shooter to an empty square in a straight orthogonal or diagonal line, without jumping over any other pieces. Then, you must place a stone of your color on an empty square that is a straight orthogonal or diagonal line away from the square onto which the shooter was moved (or from any shooter, if none was moved), with no other pieces in between along that line. This is called shooting. Claimed shooters (see below) cannot move or shoot.&#10;&#10;At this moment, if there are any trapped shooters on the board that have not been claimed before, each one of them is claimed by the player who owns the biggest group orthogonally adjacent to it. If there is no such group or the biggest such groups of each color are the same size, the shooter is claimed by the opponent. Claiming a shooter is indicated by placing a stone of the corresponding color on top of it. Claimed shooters remain unchanged for the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player has claimed the majority of shooters, i.e. at least four of them. That player wins. Draws are not possible.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Smaller versions&#10;&#10;For shorter but still reasonable games, the following variants are suggested:&#10;&#10;&#10;     7x7 board with three shooters. The first player places one shooter, and White places the other two. Whoever claims two shooters wins.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     9x9 board with five shooters. The first player places two shooters, and White places the other three. Whoever claims three shooters wins.&#10;&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;     Board Game Arena (real-time, turn-based)&#10;     Boardspace.net (real-time, AI option)&#10;&#10;&#10;Mobile Apps&#10;&#10;     Boardspace.net local multiplayer or online, IOS&#10;     Boardspace.net local multiplayer or online, Android&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Players draft one card, pass the remaining cards left, draft a second card, pass again, draft a third card, pass again, then the game changes; players simultaneously choose and reveal a card, carrying out its effects, then they draft another card, pass the remaining cards, play again, and so on until ten &quot;playing&quot; rounds have passed, at which point the game ends and players tally their holdings.&#10;&#10;The card types are thugs, holdings and actions. Thugs and holdings might have a cost to be played (perhaps cash paid to the bank or the discarding of a holding) or a condition that you must meet (having two thugs, for example, or a collection of symbols on cards in your possession) in addition to an effect, which is unique to each card. (Each action has a unique effect as well.) When you play a holding with one or more symbols, you place a token on that card for each symbol on it and an additional token for each symbol of that type already in your possession. These tokens are worth $10k each at the end of the game, and you add this value to whatever cash you've collected through your card plays.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The classic Monopoly with constructions and other elements of Witten, a city in Germany.&#10;&#10;Monopoly is a roll-and-move game where players move around the game board buying or trading properties, developing their properties with houses and hotels. When opponents land on players owned property, the owning player collects rent from the landing player. Owning sets of properties increases the rent paid to the player who owns them, by the player who lands on the square. The ultimate goal is to have the most money and drive opponents into bankruptcy.&#10;&#10;",

It's designed for two to six players of any age, as long as they can understand how to make matches with dice.&#10;&#10;The goal is to get as high a score as possible without losing your turn. To do this, you roll five special dice (four white, one red), each with one side blank. The red die is called the &quot;Danger Die.&quot;  If at any time you roll all white blanks, or you roll a red blank, your turn ends without scoring.&#10;&#10;You score points by making three/four/five-of-a-kind matches or a straight (1-2-3-4-5). After each roll, you can stop and bank your points (gaining bonus points for matches, plus the total of all spots on the dice), or you can set aside dice of your choice and reroll what's left. However, you MUST set aside any blank white dice after each roll.&#10;&#10;An added element of risk management comes when you have a bonus score available, such as from four-of-a-kind. When you do, you have the extra choice of hanging onto those bonus points and rerolling all five dice, with the bonus score still in jeopardy if you should roll blanks and lose your turn. This lets you &quot;start over&quot; with a higher starting value, but all the same risks of losing your turn.&#10;&#10;Educational Value&#10;&#10;Chikken teaches kids to understand and analyze risks. For younger kids, it's a matching game, and for slightly older ones, they can count up spots, or add up the numbers as they go. And it's still fun for everyone!&#10;&#10;",

You can always crack yours open to find out, but if the Daimyo shows up before you repair it (or pass it off on some other spy) you are in trouble.&#10;&#10;Game play is simple &ndash; you draw and discard to form a hand of cards, each of which can be Locations or People. All of them give you the ability to perform actions like steal cards, repair broken scrolls, gain intelligence, or other forms of intrigue.&#10;&#10;You win by having the most points, earned by delivering the most important scroll, accumulating cards, and not being the messenger who gets killed.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Collision is a super-hero deck building game, created by Magenic Technologies. In Collision, players play as software superheroes (The Automator, The Architect, The Oracle, Big Data, and The Mechanic) to build a deck utilizing additional heroes, super-powers, gear, and additional equipment to fight villains big and small, from small bugs all the way up to the evil Retrograde and Rain Cloud.&#10;&#10;On each turn, the active player plays cards from their hands. Most cards in the game yield from 1 to 5 power, which is the main currency of the game. Other cards allow manipulation of the player's discard pile, drawing additional cards, ridding the deck of unwanted cards or additional bonuses. Having accumulated power during their turn, players finally use their power to purchase additional cards to increase their deck's strength. Each card purchased is worth victory points, and the person who has the most victory points at the end of the game is the winner!&#10;&#10;",

Each battle is different according to the terrain dice thrown, which determine how many and which dice may battle, if any are modified/doubled, and how many actions each player may take per turn.  Each type of die has basic abilities (resurrection/banishment, mimicry, split attacks, join-forces, re-roll opponent die/dice, re-roll own die/dice), and all but the d4 have special abilities activated by rolling pairs (or more) of the same number.&#10;&#10;The player with initiative (usually lower total roll) takes one, two, or three actions (based on the throw of the terrain dice) before the opponent has a chance to respond. Actions include one die attacking another or activating abilities, or activating abilities and then attacking an opponent's die (most common).&#10;&#10;There is a balance between thinking through the possibilities and over-thinking what your opponent may do, particularly in the selection of which dice to roll at the beginning of each battle.  Each battle will consist of different combinations of dice, resulting in different abilities interacting, keeping the game fresh and interesting throughout.&#10;&#10;",

Containing spies, witches, faeries, magicians and other creatures from all over the world you must select your cabal wisely.&#10;&#10;Cabals: The Board Game brings together key deck building mechanics with board control in a new battle that can either be won through board domination or conquering the opponents stronghold. Once the battleground has been constructed the luck of the draw and your deck building skills dictate what creatures you have at your disposal. Units battle one another backed up by spells and lead by a single hero for your deck from one of the four cabals.&#10;&#10;The turn sequence comprises of gaining domination points, gaining resources, drawing cards, the main strategic phase (containing combat) and ending your turn. Resources dictate what cards you can use and this combined with loyalty points (depending on the cabals and their allegiances) the player has a deep, strategic game to conquer on many levels. The game is based on the digital Cabals: Magic & Battle Cards and these same key mechanics prevail but this version has more streamlined gameplay suitable to a tabletop game.&#10;&#10;",

However this is a hard challenge because the game offers several options to obstruct or threaten the enemy&rsquo;s vessels. Planting sharp mines in the route of the ships is one of them, or you may choose to bluff and plant fake mines that look exactly like real ones...&#10;&#10;How does it play?&#10;&#10;- Every turn the active player rolls a die. The die shows how many actions you have to take in your round: 1, 2 or 3. &#10; - After you roll, you can plant mines on empty fields if you want.&#10; - Now choose a ship and spend your actions. Turn, move or shoot. Every ship type has its unique weapons, and specific role in the battle.&#10; - The first player who hits their opponent's Command Ship is the winner.&#10;&#10;What this game offers:&#10;&#10;- short, simple, easy-to-understand rules,&#10;- quick set up, no more than 5 minutes after the second game,&#10;- relatively short rounds (30-45 minutes), no time to get bored.&#10;&#10;",

The first player to unite all of his pieces on the board into a single group wins.&#10;&#10;To start, white places one piece anywhere on the 8x8 square board. Players then alternate placing pieces on the board, with the first piece being adjacent to the opponent's most recently placed piece and the second piece being adjacent to no pieces, either orthogonally or diagonally.&#10;&#10;Once a player can't place a second piece, the placement phase ends and the next player starts the movement phase. On a turn, a player moves one piece akin to a queen in chess, with movement ending after passing through any number of empty spaces or by landing on an opponent's piece and capturing it. If this move increases the total number of groups on the board &mdash; with a group being a single stone or a series of straight- or diagonally-connected like-colored stones &mdash; then the move is illegal. Gameplay continues until one player unites all of his pieces into a single group; if he simultaneously creates single groups for both players, then the game is a draw.&#10;&#10;Instead of using a chess board, Inertia can be played on a hexhex board with pieces moving like hex rooks.&#10;&#10;",

Each turn, players recruit one card from their hand and then pass the rest of their hand to the player on their left. Every time a card is recruited, it goes into that player&rsquo;s army pile. Only the top card is visible in each player&rsquo;s army at any given time. There are two types of cards available in the game&mdash;Monster cards and Hired Hand cards. Each Monster card has a unique scoring mechanism. Players must recruit them wisely in order to maximize the amount of points of their army. Hired hand cards are placed separate from an army and, when activated, have special abilities that affect the game. The player who raises the most powerful army, wins! .&#10;&#10;Overlords easily plays under 20 minutes. The game is simple to teach, yet tough to master. There is even a 2 vs 2 option that allows for some interesting team play.&#10;&#10;",

If not avoidable, the trick taking can be mitigated by playing a swear word card, or by a Socc'mel card, which transfer the suit to another player. Goal of the game is pushing the other players anger-meter (&quot;incazzometro&quot;) beyond 10 to eliminate them from the game.&#10;&#10;The game is marketed for ages 6 up, with the explicit proviso that obscenities from Bologna are widely accepted and not considered offensive (which is the case, to some extent...).&#10;&#10;",

Each player starts with their 6 dice in their home territory and they advance into the field to play.  Players alternate moving one of their pieces with the winner being the first player to capture 4 of their opponent&rsquo;s pieces.&#10;&#10;The value of each die face determines the movement and capability of the piece &ndash; smaller values move lesser distances but can Capture larger dice &ndash; higher value dice move greater distances but Expose smaller dice - equal value dice Influence the value of neighbouring dice, including your own.   Pieces may move forward or backward according to the movement rules defined for each die facing.&#10;&#10;Stuterfuge includes many layers of strategic play and brain-burning tactical play, as the dice values change throughout the game.   Game length can vary between 15 to 60 mins, depending on the time permitted for each move.  Multiple variants are also included in the rules, allowing wildly different tactics and play for each game.&#10;&#10;",

The game takes you from Starter Deck to Regionals in about 2-3 hours.&#10;&#10;Multiple games can also be chained together to form a Campaign, going from Regionals to Nationals in game 2 and from Nationals to Worlds in game 3, with each game introducing ever more powerful cards and higher stakes, but also resetting the power of the game so that each player has a fair chance to win each 'season' of the campaign.&#10;&#10;The game draws heavily on Manga/Anime inspiration for its art, and parodies Magic: the Gathering, Yugioh, and many other collectible games.&#10;&#10;At its heart, it&rsquo;s a commodity trading game, except that instead of cubes or stocks, the things you&rsquo;ll be buying, selling, and speculating on are trading cards that can be used throughout the game in periodic tournaments. By trading wisely, playing the market, working together with friends, building collections, and winning tournaments, you&rsquo;ll secure points and become the Millennium Blades World Champion.&#10;&#10;The game features a system of card pods, where you will play with about 400 of the base game&rsquo;s 600 cards every game.&#10;&#10;",

Professions, such as &quot;politician&quot;, &quot;actor&quot;, &quot;soldier&quot;, etc.&#10;3.

The fastest player reveals the top card of one of the remaining decks, and now the players try to name the person who matches two criteria, and so on.&#10;&#10;For example, if the cards &quot;C&quot; and &quot;She wrote a book&quot; were revealed, it's possible to name Julius Caesar, Winston Churchill, Clive Barker, or any other person with the first &quot;C&quot; in his/her name (or surname, or nickname) and known as an author. If nobody could name a person after the next card was revealed, than the player who had correctly named the previous person wins a round. You cannot reveal more than 4 cards (one per deck): if someone has managed to name a person with 4 cards, he wins that round.&#10;&#10;The game is played till one of the decks is depleted.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;96 cards (24 per deck)&#10;2 blank cards for your own tasks&#10;rules&#10;&#10;",

Every capture results in a pillar being erected on the square where the capture took place. Pillars belong to the captor and move as chess queens. They can neither capture nor move over pieces.&#10;&#10;Stacks can be split or joined. Whether a stack is vulnerable to capture is determined by the number of adjacent squares. Pillars take away such squares and thus heighten vulnerability of adjacent stacks.&#10;&#10;A player wins by eliminating all of the opponent's stacks from the board (regardless of any reserves either player might have in hand) or by leaving his opponent without a legal move. Cooperative cycles are inherently possible, but in regular play the game will seldom end in a draw.&#10;&#10;The game can be played using simple generic material: a chess board, draughtsmen, and chess pawns to represent pillars.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Description&#10;ILLEGAL is a crazy, offbeat party game for 5 to 9 players where participants each take on the role of an illegal dealer. The game is accessible to casual as well as expert gamers, and has a mature theme. The rules of ILLEGAL are simple, but the game will challenge your skills in negotiation, misdirection, discretion, charisma, and persuasion. The more you play, the more you will learn to expand and master these skills. Each game lasts about half an hour, and is packed with intense exchanges, interactions and a lot of humour.&#10;&#10;Launch into this risqu&eacute; adventure! Dare to become one of these offbeat dealers and get a good laugh with your friends.&#10;&#10;How to Play&#10;&#10;ILLEGAL is played in two phases:&#10;&#10;During the first phase, each player receives a deck of cards prepared by the Game Master (GM). These decks assign each player his dealer role and gives him a good quantity of the corresponding resources. Each player's deck also specifies his buyer role, and he will make every effort during the game to get as many resources as possible of the type he is interested in. These roles are kept secret until the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Players leave the table and split up into continually changing pairs or groups to negotiate and exchange some of their resources, away from prying eyes. Every three minutes, they return to the table to collect new resources at the docks (from the GM). Then they go again for another three minutes of secret dealing.&#10;&#10;The second phase, called the Tribunal phase, starts once the players have returned to the table and the GM has run out of resources.&#10;&#10;At the tribunal, players play the roles of jury members, witnesses, suspects and judges! They openly discuss their suspicions concerning the secret roles assigned to every other player. The GM reveals the suspect cards in pairs representing the dealer and buyer roles assigned to the various players. For each card pair, players have one minute to debate. After one minute, a simultaneous vote is cast, and a suspect is formally accused.&#10;&#10;Scoring&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, each player reveals his role pair and acquired resources. He scores one victory point for each resource acquired corresponding to his buyer role, one point for each suspect card accusing him wrongly, thus rewarding him for his skills in misdirection and discretion, but he loses 5 points for each suspect card accurately accusing him, representing 5 years spent in prison. It is very easy to end the game with a 10-year jail sentence if you are insufficiently discreet or are too greedy!&#10;&#10;",

One is the good player representing a member of Charlie's Angels I assume, and the other is the evil player, representing an Enemy Agent.&#10;&#10;Players move according to their die roll not forgetting to obey the instructions on special squares, and the first to launch the Rescue Missile (Space 38), wins.&#10;&#10;The rules say that the game can be played alone, by 'playing fairly' for the enemy agent's die rolls. It is the first time in a Goose-type game that I have seen a square that only applies to the Charlie's Angel player, who, if she lands on it, she is knocked out of the game. There is no such square for the Enemy Agent so he has a small advantage.&#10;&#10;",

Each game includes an authentic Chinese i-ching coin. In Hei Su Hong Su, when tokens are moved off one end of the board, they return on the opposite side. Additionally, unlike other popular strategy games, players are permitted to move neutral and their opponent&rsquo;s tokens as their own. Hei Su Hong Su is truly a unique and intriguing strategy game.&#10;&#10;In Hei Su Hong Su, one player is red, other is black. At the start of the game, each player has nine pieces set up in a square in opposite corners on the board, with 18 white pieces occupying the other two corners. Players take turns &ldquo;sliding&rdquo; rows or columns of pieces by removing a piece from an edge and adding it to the other edge. If a player traps a piece by surrounding it with 4 of his color (including &ldquo;wrapping around&rdquo; to the other side of the board), it is replaced with with one of that player's pieces. If a player captures and replaces a white piece, the &ldquo;tug of war&rdquo; marker moves 1 in his favor on the scale. If a player captures and replaces an opponent&rsquo;s piece, the marker moves 2 in his favor on the scale. The game ends when the marker has moved all the way to the end of the scale; that player is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Will Bigfoot's hideaways be discovered, leaving him with nowhere to go, or will the Cryptozoologist be left frustrated?&#10;&#10;This new game from up and coming designer Scott Almes is the ultimate battle of wits! Depending on what side you're on, you'll be playing a very different game - The Cryptozoologist is laying traps and attempting to trick the Bigfoot who must deduce and work out what's the best option...&#10;&#10;One player plays the Cryptozoologist who is hunting for Bigfoot, played by the other player. Each round, the Cryptozoologist will lay out a series of cards in two &lsquo;paths&rsquo;, which will contain sensing equipment and special actions. Then, Bigfoot must choose which path to go on, triggering any sensing equipment and giving the Cryptozoologist a few more clues about his Lair. The Cryptozoologist wins by pinning Bigfoot in one of his Lairs, while Bigfoot wins by eluding the Cryptozoologist for six rounds. Capturing this beast won't be easy...!&#10;&#10;By slowly eliminating the various potential lairs, the Cryptozoologist will slowly whittle down the places where Bigfoot could actually be hiding. However, if this isn't done by the end of the sixth round the beast will escape the clutches of 'science'!&#10;&#10;",

As you move down the trail, you'll draw cards, which might be good or bad for you, bad for opponents, or terrible for everyone at the table. You'll also acquire useful items and specialties &mdash; with each character having a different set of things to find &mdash; have adventures, and come into conflict with other players. Conflict in Cross Hares takes the form of either shoving each other back and forth around the map or stealing items.&#10;&#10;Don't worry if you're far back on the path away from everyone else as with the right events or die rolls, you can race ahead of the others! Once you get to the factory, though, you'll need all of your skills and items to defeat it, so be sure you save some of your strength for that.&#10;&#10;",

It's played on the intersections (points) of an initially empty square or rectangular board. Board sizes bigger than 9x9 are not recommended. 6x7 boards have been used in some human matches.&#10;&#10;NoGo takes the Go concepts of group and liberty and uses them in the most minimalistic possible way. The resulting game, with no captures, no cycles and no scoring, is no rival for Go, but remains a fertile ground for tactical challenges in the Dots and Boxes style.&#10;&#10;This game seems to have been first mentioned by someone called John Moore at Sensei's Library, in April 1, 2005.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Definitions&#10;&#10;A group is a set of orthogonally adjacent, like-colored stones.&#10;&#10;A liberty of a group is an empty point orthogonally adjacent to that group.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Play&#10;&#10;Black plays first, then turns alternate. On his turn, a player must place a stone of his color on an empty point of the board. At the end of a turn, all groups on the board (both friendly and enemy) must have at least one liberty. Otherwise the player's move is illegal. Whoever can't make a move on his turn loses.&#10;&#10;",

These multiple games can be played at different levels, depending on the musical knowledge of the players. The deck consists of 52 cards representing musical notes and rhythmic figures, with the help of the Circles of Fifths printed on each card, and with different suits or colors, together with some special wildcards.&#10;&#10;It consists of many different games, featuring different game mechanics and goals: getting more points or cards than your opponents, be the first to run out of cards, move cards to certain places on the table, etc. In every game there are two different &ldquo;levels&rdquo; to keep track: the Musical Level and the Strategy Level, and both are independent from each other. The Strategy Level depends on the particular game, while the Musical Level can be adjusted in most of the games. Some of the games are up to 10 players, others are solitary type ones, for 2 players, and even some of the games can be played in teams or cooperatively.&#10;&#10;Pawns are used in some of the games, and Game of Tones also includes two additional board games. These games are called Pianogram, in which the board represents a G-clef staff or a piano, depending on the orientation in which it is placed; and Fretboard, in which the board represents a guitar (or any other stringed instrument) neck.&#10;&#10;Designed from an educational standpoint, Game of Tones includes a list of the musical concepts used in every game, and a teaching guide for music teachers. Game of Tones is not language dependent, except for the instructions, which are available in English and Spanish.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Otters is a quick, kid-friendly card game for 2-4 players ages 6 and up. Players take turns sending otters from their hand to the lake playgrounds on the board, playing 2 cards per turn. If you add enough otters to a playground to fill it up, you win that playground! Whoever has the most valuable collection of playgrounds at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;Most of the game is made up of simple otters numbered 1, 2 or 3. Players must decide which 2 of their cards in hand to play, and which playgrounds to play them to.&#10;&#10;There are also special otters in the deck, which players can use to try to win playgrounds quickly, plus alligator cards to keep opponents away from playgrounds.&#10;&#10;The playgrounds themselves range in value from 2 to 10, making some easy to win with a card or two, but less valuable to your final score. Others are hard to win but worth lots of points! And if you collect all three playgrounds of the same color, you get bonus points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Otters is simple enough for kids to play, helping them to learn basic addition. But it's also designed to be interesting for adults, requiring strategic decision making.&#10;&#10;Ultimately, Otters is a game about playing with adorable otters with your friends and family.&#10;&#10;",

There is only one solution to save humanity from the apocalypse: to find five ingredients to cook a tasty paella that calms the rage of the fallera.&#10;&#10;A unique game based on a 100 cards deck. Players (2 to 5) must find 5 ingredient cards to win the game. Ingredients, as well as other kind of treasures, can be stolen by other players. They can use battle cards to fight and achieve other's possessions, comparing attack and defense points of the two cards in the battle. Bluffing is also a must, as the player who is attacked can't see the character that is using his opponent. Players may also use very different kind of special cards not only to strengthen their soldiers, but to fiercely punish their competitors.&#10;&#10;",

Each tile draws three or four of the four elements (the pond, moss, colored leaves, gravel). If a placed tile is connected to an already placed tile by the same elements, the player gets that score. Because it scores in each element, it is possible that the player will get the score of multiple elements at the same time.&#10;&#10;In addition, each player has an element to get bonus points.

Starting in the Servants' Hall, each player is dealt Destination cards which have varying values indicated by the number of bells on the card. This relates to how important or difficult the task is. The players must then navigate their way around the corridors and stairs of the Abbey, throwing the dice to determine how many moves they can make.&#10;&#10;Once they reach the destination of a task, they collect their bell tokens, and the next player throws the dice to set off for the next job. But nothing is that simple! Along the way, a player can land on a 'Carson Card' space and have to take a card, which could either help or hinder them. On other spaces, the player may have to collect a 'Letter' which could call them away from the Abbey, slowing them down or costing them bells! And which route will they take? A short easy looking one to get a job done earning only one bell, or a longer route with the possibility of collecting a higher reward?&#10;&#10;The winner is the player who has completed all their jobs and collected the most bells.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Theme - Shine is a biblically based deck building game. In Shine, you are a person who has recently become a Christian. Though saved and forgiven, you still struggle with sin. Your goal is to remove sin from your life and grow in spiritual maturity. To do this, you will spend time in God&rsquo;s word, prayer, and use your spiritual gifts to minister to the lost and the hurting. It is not as easy as it seems. Satan prowls like a roaring lion. You will face various temptations, but through it all, God will never leave you or forsake you.&#10;&#10;Game objective - The object of this game is to build a deck, called a Life Deck. This deck represents a player&rsquo;s spiritual maturity. Each player starts off with spiritual fruit, and a lot of sin. As the game progresses, players try to remove sin from their life decks and gain various cards, including more spiritual fruit. Character cards that represent people in need and sets of fruit cards are worth victory points.  Sin cards are worth negative victory points. The player, with the most victory points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Game play - As a player you have the choice to pray or to shine.&#10;&#10;If you choose to pray, you start off by using one of your spiritual gifts. Spiritual gifts allow a player to gain a specific spiritual fruit card. There are 9 different kinds of fruit cards and they are the resource used in Shine to gain other cards. &#10;- You may use the abilities on scripture cards that take effect during prayer. &#10;- You may remove a card from your deck, usually sin. &#10;- You may also place any number of cards from your hand into your discard pile. &#10;- To conclude your turn you draw cards until you have 7 cards in your hand.&#10;&#10;If you choose to shine, you start by using one of your spiritual gifts. &#10;- You may play and use the abilities on scripture cards and character cards that you gained during previous rounds. &#10;- You may trade a fruit card with any card in the fellowship pool. The fellowship pool allows players to trade fruit cards. &#10;- You may trade in 2 fruit cards to gain a new fruit card. When you trade in a card it is removed from your deck.&#10;- You may play fruit cards to gain new scripture and character cards.&#10;- To conclude your turn draw cards until you have 7 cards in your hand.&#10;&#10;When a player draws the last card from their life deck, the current round ends. &#10;- Each player shuffles their discarded life cards and places them under their life decks.&#10;- Then each player draws the top card of their temptation deck and does what it says. Temptation cards force the player to draw more sin cards and have stronger effects if a player has sin that they have not dealt with.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all of the temptation cards have been drawn. Character cards and full sets of 9 fruit cards are worth positive victory points and sin cards are worth negative victory points. The player with the most victory points is considered to be the most spiritually mature and is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Combined, they form an easy, fun-to-play game about trying to eat as many people as possible to become the fattest zombie! For once you become the fattest zombie... then you shall be King! Why King? Zombies don't care about money, political power or fundraising; they only care about brains. Not even the quality of brain eaten, merely the quantity.&#10;&#10;So you and your friends (2-4) set out upon the grandest adventure: to eat as many brains as possible from the hapless humans! But be wary, for the humans are not without the means to defend themselves, and the fattest zombie may soon become the dead undead!&#10;&#10;Playing Fat Zombie only takes about twenty minutes, even if you have never played the game. You and your friends are Zombies that wander the streets, looking for delicious brains! On your turn, you draw the top card of the deck and play it for all to see. You will then roll the die to see if you eat the human, if he escapes or hides, or if he kills you.&#10;&#10;",

A sergeant can move, like a chess pawn, a double-step straight forward on its first move.&#10;    A pawn (but not a sergeant) may capture an enemy pawn or sergeant en passant.&#10;    Pawns and sergeants promote on the last rank to queen, wolf, fox, rook, bishop, nightrider, or knight.

        "description": "When mankind first discovered warp points, the gravitational anomalies that allowed him to travel to the stars, humanity spread like wildfire. A mighty Empire of Man grew in all directions. Colonies were planted on any planet that could support them. New spacefaring races were encountered, trade established, wars fought. Until finally the Empire of Man grew too large; internal dissention and external jealousy conspired to destroy it. First the far-flung Empire became too difficult to control centrally.  Outer systems demanded more sovereignty, leading to rebellion and civil war. And once that war was lost, neighboring races pounced, snatching what they could. The collapse culminated in the bombardment of Terra and the subjugation of most of the remaining colonies.&#10;&#10;Now, years later, humans on Old Terra have finally recovered. Humanity has spread all over known space, but humans on Mother Terra are ready to reach again for the stars. Ready to reclaim their Shattered Empire&#10;&#10;Shattered Empire is a Print and Play (PnP) solo game in which the player takes on the struggles of the people of Earth to rebuild and defend their new star empire. The map depicts the systems around Old Terra and, beyond that, the regions controlled by other governments and races. Each turn represents about a decade of time and each ship counter is an individual starship. Players try to expand and defend their empire and score victory points over a 150 year period of time (less if your empire completely succumbs to its foes).&#10;&#10;",

Players use customized decks to play out fast, exciting battles while others bet on the outcome. Winning bets earns you the cash you need to improve your deck.&#10;&#10;Players represent gladiators in a Roman arena. Each round they have a chance to buy better weapons, techniques, and armor to help them defeat their foes &mdash; with each purchase making a better (and more expensive) version of that card available. Then, they'll challenge one of their opponents to a one-on-one throwdown.&#10;&#10;Fights are fast, exciting, and surprisingly tactical. First, players reveal three cards from their deck. Based on this information, all other players bet on the outcome. Players then pick those cards up, draw two more cards, and secretly divide them all into two hands: one hand to be used for its fighting power, the other for the special abilities on the cards. They'll then play out a quick best-of-three combat, simultaneously revealing cards, comparing their powers, and, when necessary, deploying hidden tricks.&#10;&#10;When the dust settles, the winning fighter collects a victory chip, and the spectators who bet on him win coins that they can use to improve their decks. Players win the game by besting all of their opponents in combat.&#10;&#10;",

One player takes on the role of the leader of the counter-attacking French 4th DCR forces, the other the commander of those defending the German bridgehead.&#10;&#10;After breaking out of the Ardennes Forest and fighting over the Meuse River at Dinant and Sedan, German mechanized forces raced across France to the Channel, effectively splitting the Allies in two. By the end of May the English announced their intention to withdraw the BEF (British Expeditionary Force) at Dunkirk.  Increasingly desperate, the French high command cobbled together a counter-attack force centered on the newly-formed 4th DCR (Division Char de Reserve), led by General Charles DeGaulle, to retake the channel port of Abbeville.  Victory here against the strung out 57th Bavarian Infantry Division could reunify the Allied forces, and also cut-off the deadly but depleted panzer divisions that had earlier wrought so much havoc.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 40 minutes&#10;Hex: 0.25 miles / 0.40 kilometer&#10;Units: Company&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;Two 11x17&quot; full color maps&#10;One single-side printed un-mounted countersheet (200 1/2&quot; counters)(mounted counters are optional)&#10;One 8-page rulebook&#10;One Player Aid Chart&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium&#10;Complexity Level: Low&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 1.5 to 2 hours&#10;&#10;",

You gain food by growing it on your farm or by plundering your opponents as a warlord. Struggle through drought, pestilence, and aggressive neighbors to become the greatest farmer of all time!&#10;&#10;The game can be played with 2 to 4 players, but is best with 4.  The game content is appropriate for any age, but the complexity would be a reasonable challenge for a bright seven year old.  Game play is about 45 minutes to an hour, and you will have eaten (usually) 16 of the edible counters when you are done.  (... so don't use large cookies or shots of tequila, but animal crackers or small, disposable cups of beer work fine).&#10;&#10;The game lasts for 8 'years,' where each year is split into two seasons.  Each year the players draw cards and choose (in advance) one to play each in the spring and summer seasons.  The players choose whether or not to plant their fields for the spring season, then the spring weather is revealed and players resolve their actions.  There is some flexibility in how a player chooses to resolve the action, especially if he did not plant, but he must use the card that he previously selected for the season.  Crops are calculated and each player must eat one 'food.'  Hopefully he is not eating the last of his seed crop!  Then the planting, weather, action resolution, and crop resolution are repeated for the summer season.  Finally, any warlord tribute is paid before the next year starts.&#10;&#10;The game is about 60% luck and 40% skill -- the best players tend to win more often but not every game.  It is silly and fun, with unexpected turnarounds due to odd weather or unexpected cards.  There is also a mechanic where a player who has been wiped out can cash in 'food stamps' and keep playing.&#10;&#10;",

A typical game lasts between 15-30 minutes, and the minimum age recommended is 5 years old.&#10;&#10;Golf 'n' Roll takes place in a rectangular board with 4 golfer tiles, 4 circular numbered ball tokens and 4 dice (white, green, yellow and red).&#10;&#10;The holes in the board are divided into squares, where golfers move after hitting the ball. Each of these squares have a gem whose color indicates the difficulty of that trail (green, yellow or red) and a flag indicating the presence or not of obstacles (free, vertical or cross mark).

Or if you prefer the typical werewolf rules, you can use the Krampus cards and kidnap your fellow elves.&#10;&#10;This is a social deduction game where players are on naughty and nice teams. At nights, naughty elves break a present. During the days, the nice elves vote on who they think is naughty.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one of two conditions are met: &#10;1.) All naughty elves are exiled and the nice elves win! &#10;2.) All the nice presents are destroyed and the naughty elves &#10;win.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Martinetti is a type of simple traditional dice game of &quot;climbing&quot; up and down using the results of die rolls. According to game designer and aficionado Dan Glimne it is reputed to date back to Roman times; be that as it may, it could be a precursor to number matching dice games such as Shut the Box&#10;&#10;Two or more players can participate, each one writing down a progression of numbers from 1 to 12 and then from 12 back down to 1. On their turn, a player rolls three dice and then crosses off as many numbers as possible, typically in order, by matching them to the numbers on the dice or sums that these add up to. E.g. a first-turn roll of 6-1-1 would allow crossing off the numbers 1 and 2, and a lucky roll of 4-2-1 would mean crossing off every number from 1 to 7. Rerolls may be allowed as long as at least one number was crossed out on the previous roll, except after scoring the first 12.&#10;&#10;The first player to reach the end of their sequence, 1 to 12 to 1, is the winner.&#10;&#10;Variations concern for instance restrictions on the order in which numbers may be crossed out; restrictions on the use of dice; whether there are two 12 spaces or just one; and whether and how re-rolls are used. If numbers can only be crossed out in strict order, player advancement can be recorded using individual tokens on a single path of numbered spaces.&#10;&#10;Similar games include Everest, Mount Everest, Roll and Score Dice Derby Game, and Tolvan&#10;&#10;",

It&rsquo;s played with trapezium-shaped pieces on the cells of an initially empty basket-weave grid. The top and bottom edges of the board are colored red; the left and right edges are colored blue.&#10;&#10;All pieces are the same and only differ in color. They can be placed with any side (front or back) up. A cell can accommodate two pieces, and no piece can be placed in a way that makes this physically impossible.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Definitions&#10;&#10;Two pieces are point adjacent if they share nothing more than a vertex, and edge adjacent if they share at least part of a side longer than a vertex.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Play&#10;&#10;Starting with Red, the players take turns placing pieces of their own color on empty spaces of the board, one piece per turn.&#10;&#10;At the end of a turn, for any two point adjacent, like-colored pieces there must be at least one like-colored piece edge adjacent to both.&#10;&#10;Passing is not allowed. Players will always have a placement available and must make one.&#10;&#10;The game is won by the player who completes a chain of edge adjacent pieces of their color touching the two opposite board edges of his color. Draws are not possible.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Pie rule&#10;&#10;The pie rule is used in order to make the game fair. This means that Blue will have the option, on their first turn only, to change sides instead of making a regular move.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "A 2-5 Player game that pits mobs against each other, fighting for territory while building and fortifying their own empire. This is a light resource management game with dice battling, card management, and medium to heavy card strategy.&#10;&#10;Your goal is to take over all opposing territories or remove the other players from the game by killing them or crippling their resources/ability to the point of defeat. As one of the Gang Boss's in the game, during your turn you can assign your men into certain locations to extort money (to be used to buy or upgrade items/weapons); train your men with upgradable abilities to spy, fight, influence, or lead better; visit the black market auction with other players for high caliber items, or lead full scale attacks against others to try to overrun their businesses and territories.&#10;&#10;The game includes 5 different decks (54 cards per deck) that represent different mobs, such as the Italian Mafia, Chinese Triads, Japanese Yakuza, Urban Dynasty, and Latino Cartels. In addition, other decks currently available separately are the 5-0 and the Russian Bratva.&#10;&#10;Types of cards include Boss Cards, Recruitment Cards, Action Cards, Gear Cards, Black Market Cards, and Event Cards.&#10;&#10;",

They have spring loaded legs and specially designed hands so players can shoot, pass and even reverse slam dunk. It took a team of four LEGO designers and six engineers a full year just to develop the arms and hands so that the minifigures could properly hold, and throw a small basketball piece. They also featured more realistic skin tones, being based on real-life NBA players from real teams.&#10;&#10;",

One randomly chosen player is elected Reader and pulls a Topic Card. The Reader picks a topic&#10;of their choosing from the Topic Card and reads it aloud.&#10;3. All of the other players answer the question on separate pieces of scratch paper abiding by their&#10;Challenge Card and passes it face down to the Reader.&#10;4. While answers are submitted, the Reader should check handwriting so answers have full effect&#10;when read aloud.&#10;5. The Reader shuffles all of the answers and shares each answer with the group, pausing in between&#10;reading each one. The answer with the most laughs wins a point.&#10;6. After the round, a new player becomes the Reader and everyone re&shy;draws a Challenge Card.&#10;7. The player who reaches 10 points first wins. You can alter the win condition to your game&#10;environment.&#10;&#10;Topic Cards:&#10;Words...&#10;Creatively define the word given, but don&rsquo;t worry about coming anywhere close to the real definition!&#10;Just give it whatever meaning strikes you.&#10;Famous People...&#10;Tell us what He or She is famous for...your version anyway. Create an elaborate back story to the&#10;person or tell us a creative tale involving this person.&#10;Movie Titles...&#10;Come up with a terribly clever plot line for the film listed. Is it a documentary? Maybe a hushed noir&#10;film of yesteryear?&#10;Laws...&#10;Fill in the blanks to complete these laws.

        "description": "Luck O' The Dice is a game that consists of dice, cards, and coins.  Each player has 6 dice and starts with 5 cards in their hand.  There are two types cards, dice cards and leprechaun cards.  The dice cards have combinations that each player must roll in order to obtain coins, such as 2 pair of a run of 4.  More coins are received if the player rolls dice combinations in one roll instead of having to roll additional times in order to obtain the desired combination.  Upon completing a dice card the player will place this card face up in front of them.  The game ends when any player completes 5 dice cards.  The first player to complete 5 dice cards also gets a bonus which makes it advantageous to complete dice cards the quickest.  The winner of the game is the person with the most coins.&#10;&#10;Leprechaun cards allow players to inhibit their opponent's play or to advance their own.  These cards are played at the beginning of a player's turn.  An example is the Slicer card which allows a player to reduce the number of dice a selected opponent can roll on their next turn.  Every leprechaun card relies on the dice, so player's are never assured of their effectiveness.&#10;&#10;This game truly revolves around the use of dice and a player's luck can change with just one roll!&#10;&#10;",

Players are encouraged to be clever and to speak with a silver tongue!&#10;&#10;During each round of the game, one person will act as the Judge and will take a card from the deck and place it face up. That card is the Target Card. Everyone else then takes a card from their hand and places that card face down. Next, each player must try and convince the Judge that their card is the Target Card by using true information about the card that they just placed down. The act of convincing the Judge is known as The Pitch.&#10;&#10;Let's say Bob is the Judge, and he flips over the Target Card &quot;Hot Dogs.&quot; Susan then decides to player her &quot;French Fries&quot; card and places it face down. During her pitch, she can say:&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Well, mine's really good plain, but people usually put toppings on it, like ketchup. Others might add chili or cheese. Oh, and you really don't want to eat it cold, it's much better warm.&quot;&#10;&#10;Once everyone is finished making their pitch, the Judge picks the person who they feel had the best pitch, and declares that person the winner of the round. Players then discard the cards used during that round. Everyone but the Judge and the round winner draws a new card to replace the one that they just played. A new Judge is chosen, and a new round begins.&#10;&#10;A winner is determined once a person discards all of their cards and says &quot;These French Fries Are Terrible Hot Dogs!&quot;&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The Jane Game is a trivia board game devoted to Jane Austen&rsquo;s six novels. It is designed to bring Austen admirers together to share in her stories, characters, wit and language. While playing, each participant enters Jane&rsquo;s world as one of her heroines. As such, you seek after a fortunate life by becoming an accomplished woman, gaining societal experience and choosing to marry or not. Through chance, expertise and choice you could become the envied Mrs. Darcy, the pitied Mrs. Collins or the new roommate of Miss Bates.&#10;&#10;The Jane Game is for 2-7 players (Austen wrote seven heroines into her six novels) and lasts about an hour to an hour and a half, depending on how chatty and good-humored the heroines are.&#10;&#10;The overall objective is to obtain the greatest Life Fortune. This can be done by trading your accomplishment cards in for something of greater value. The player with the most Life Fortune is the winner.&#10;&#10;&#10;Designer's Summary:&#10;&#10;The Jane Game is a mixture between a role-playing and trivia game. Each player becomes one of Jane Austen&rsquo;s heroines seeking after a fortunate life. This fortunate life is best achieved by becoming an accomplished lady, a societal woman and by marrying well.&#10;&#10;The game has two phases: Courtship and Marriage.&#10; During the Courtship Phase, turns consist of either answering trivia (there are options of guidance from a governess for those who are not as well versed in Austen&rsquo;s works) or of acquiring Societal Tokens (Family, Ball, Trip). Trivia answered correctly gives Accomplishment Cards, which are used to acquire Societal Tokens.&#10;&#10;The Marriage Phase is quick and starts once the first heroine is married. At this point, each heroine goes to the church where proposals come according to how well trivia is answered. She then can choose her hero (i.e. Mr. Darcy), alternate (i.e. Mr. Collins), or to not marry at all (i.e. become Miss Bates&rsquo; new roommate).&#10;&#10;Once all heroines have the option to marry or not, Life Fortune Points are counted and the heroine with the most wins.&#10;&#10;",

Some proposals lead to love and happiness and some to financial prosperity, but some are nothing more than shallow seductions. Whatever happens, you must ensure that your characters come out on top!&#10;&#10;When proposing, if a Gentleman's Charm is lower than the Lady's, he must discard cards to make up the difference. If he wants to really impress her, he can discard additional cards to boost his Charm. If the Lady accepts, the players exchange characters and whoever has the higher Wealth draws cards equal to the difference. If she declines - paying cards if necessary to counter his Charm offensive - the Gentleman returns to the player's hand to brush up on his manners.&#10;&#10;Declining a proposal from a Gentleman with a higher Rank will earn you additional cards, and if you have more Ladies in Society than anyone else at the start of your turn, you get an extra 'go'. This can help you to dominate the matchmaking scene but will doubtless draw the ire of your rivals. It's good to be protective of your Ladies, but don't let them get left on the shelf...&#10;&#10;When the deck runs out, the game ends and players tally up the Virtue of their married characters, then subtract the Virtue of their 'old maids' (Ladies left unwed in Society).

        "description": "Mayhem is a &lsquo;fantasy mass battle&rsquo; combat game played on the grand scale. Here generals lead armies of their own creation on the field of battle in search of victory and glory.Not just for wargamers, Mayhem is perfect for roleplayers looking to integrate a customizable set of mass combat rules into their campaigns and adventures. The BATTLE CHEST edition includes both the core rules and the STRONGHOLD expansion.&#10;&#10;Core rules feature overview:&#10;&#10;- custom points based army construction&#10;- uses d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20 dice&#10;- VERSUS game engine [including Deadlocks and Overdrive]&#10;- play at any scale including 6mm, 10mm, 15mm, and 28mm&#10;- players can use armies based for other systems&#10;- no casualty removal&#10;- rule for magic including spells like blink, summon, and time stop&#10;- includes quick reference sheets, army construction worksheet, and General&rsquo;s Compendium&#10;- official support from popular miniature manufacturers&#10;&#10;The MAYHEM core rules give you complete control over building your army from the ground up. After creating core profiles and heroes, you have over 60 options at your disposal that can be used to equip and upgrade. These include unit designations, weapons, armor, standards, traits, abilities, and gear.&#10;&#10;The VERSUS game engine layers mechanics and interactions in such a way as to provide a truly innovative and unique gaming experience. To begin with, stats in the game are not based on fixed numbers but on die types instead. Anytime that you are called upon to roll dice, you may instead choose to take the default; this is equal to half the value of the die. This choice of risk versus reward is behind every decision in the game.  These die types can be improved in steps depending on which weapons a unit is equipped with and what type of unit it is combating. This system of soft and hard counters means no complicated tables or stat lines are needed, yet it rewards the application of both tactics and strategy.&#10;&#10;The game can be played at any scale, and players may use armies already based for other popular mass battle systems. Speaking of basing, there is no individual casualty removal in the game so hobbyists are free to make each unit a mini diorama. And, after you&rsquo;ve mastered the basics of battle, the STRONGHOLD expansion awaits!&#10;&#10;The STRONGHOLD expansion includes rules for:&#10;&#10;- advanced terrain options including the garrisoning, attacking, and burning of structures&#10;- new designations like scout, skirmisher, and heroic skirmisher&#10;- heroes to engage one another in epic challenges&#10;- battle sorcerers that can focus their magical powers to control hulking mechanical constructs or harness the fury of bound behemoths&#10;- new spells, traits, abilities, and gear&#10;- building your own strongholds and keeps including over 15 upgrades to create the ultimate fortress&#10;- siege engines and laying siege to enemy strongholds and keeps&#10;- new scenarios including border keeps and a unique mass battle multiplayer mode&#10;- campaigns and linked games with unit progression, multiple paths to victory, and seasonal weather effects&#10;&#10;The expansion has been set-up as a toolbox that will allow you to pick and choose the rules that best fit your group and the gaming experience you&rsquo;re looking for. It also means that the core rules will grow and evolve along with your tactical and strategic abilities.&#10;&#10;",

There must not be a single umpire about. The rules must cover all questions on what may or may not be done, and decide losses; and yet they must not be too long or too complicated. And the paraphernalia used in the game must be simple.&quot;&#10;&#10;A Simplified Wargame is an operational level wargame with specific historic theme. Published in Field Artillery Journal (Sept.-Oct. 1922), the game is played on a point-to-point map, drawn up at random by the players, representing a road network. Units secretly allocate military units to a number of forces represented by pins on the map. The contents of each force is hidden from the opponent. Turns are plotted and carried out simultaneously with any battles resolved using bidding mechanics. The goal is to capture the enemy capital.&#10;&#10;",

Each turn, players take an action and play a fate card that makes an event more likely to happen as well as a target more likely for the event. Actions include foraging for food, scavenging for valuables washed up ashore, and lighting the signal fire. Of course, it might be easier to forage for food in your neighbor's stockpile. Conflicts are resolved by comparing total size on each side of a fight. A random card is added to each side's total.&#10;&#10;At the end of the turn, look to see if a boat was sighted and the signal fire lit. If the players aren't yet rescued, Fate will deal a blow to somebody, then everybody must either eat food or take a wound.&#10;&#10;Secret love and hate determines victory points.&#10;&#10;",

The Jack accepts a lower card of any suit, the Queen accepts lower cards of hearts or diamonds (love or money, respectively), and the King accepts lower cards that are spades (a soldier's sword).&#10;&#10;The game is based on the idea that the four thrones are kingdoms, and you are placing people in power to maintain balance.

On a turn, a player reads the scenario on a card to his neighboring player &mdash; for example, Russia, China, North Korea and Venezuela declare war on the United States following the collapse of the dollar &mdash; then this player has three minutes to explain how he's respond to this scenario. Everyone else then awards the answering player 0-3 points, either in secret or openly as decided by the group beforehand. Whoever has the most points after an agreed upon number of rounds wins and is deemed best prepper for the end of times.&#10;&#10;",

During the game, you will hire new gangsters to do the dirty work and collect your money. Investments lead to new lines of business or monopoly positions: take control of the drug dealing, moneylending or prostitution. Bribe politicians and cops, invest your money in night clubs, casinos or the waste management industry. To get the big deals, you need to cooperate with the other families &mdash; but never rely on those &quot;friendships&quot;. The others will take the first opportunity to stab you in the back, so you better do it first...&#10;&#10;Each player controls gangster cards that serve to either gain money or attack other players. Actions are planned secretly, placed face down, then played in turn. Often you need certain business cards to succeed. If you don't own them yourself, you can negotiate deals with the other players. The players bargain, spy, threaten, and deceive each other.&#10;&#10;Each of the four rounds brings new action cards into the game, and the number of gangsters increases. Thus, the possibilities for actions become more diverse, the jobs more profitable, and the attacks more powerful. Co-operation gets more attractive and treason alluring because at the end of the day money is the only thing that counts.&#10;&#10;",

The value can be written as a first digit (tens) or as a second digit (units) in a number. The round ends when a row or column of the board has been filled up with numbers, all having a second digit and at least one having a first digit. Players will then score the numbers in the row or column that are fully in their colour; it's possible to &quot;share&quot; numbers but they won't score.&#10;&#10;A whole game consists of several rounds: three for three players and four for two or four players.&#10;&#10;",

He draws two top cards of the deck and checks the number of the next top card (which is random from 1 to 10). Then he looks at the text lines (&quot;tasks&quot;) with this number and chooses a task from one of those cards. Next, he chooses an action how to explain the task to other players: to speak, to draw, or to perform. (The method of explanation becomes unavailable for this player till he uses all three methods in his text turns.)&#10;&#10;All other players tries to guess the task. The game master and the player who gives the correct answer both score 1 victory point, keeping one of the two task cards drawn by the game master. After that the next player becomes a game master, and so on. The player with the most number of cards is declared the winner at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;200 two-sided cards (with easy and difficult tasks on opposite sides) contain 4000 different tasks.&#10;&#10;",

By placing the appropriate number of workers on the various action spaces, you can purchase mushroom, land or water; buy or implement demand or master cards; purchase new warehouses or assistants; and produce or sell mushrooms. Players can hold five cards in hand from one round to the next, and after nine rounds players tally their VPs to see who wins.&#10;&#10;",

On his turn, a player rolls the dice to move his footballers with or without the ball on the board or shoot. Footballers may be moved horizontally, vertically or diagonally. It is possible to kick, pass and dribble. To score a goal, the ball has to be kicked over the line in front of the opponent's goal mouth.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Qwixx: Das Kartenspiel captures the spirit of Qwixx &mdash; with players still trying to cross off numbers in four colored rows as best they can &mdash; but this game uses cards instead of dice, allowing for more tactics and planning as you draft and play a hand of cards.&#10;&#10;As in the original game, in Qwixx: Das Kartenspiel each player has a scoresheet with the numbers 2-12 in rows of red and yellow and the numbers 12-2 in rows of green and blue. You want to mark off as many numbers as possible, but you can mark off a number only if it's to the right of all marked off numbers in the same row. The deck has 44 cards, eleven in each color numbered 2-12; the back of each card shows the number but without the color. Each player starts with a hand of four cards, and four other cards are laid out face-down &mdash; that is, with the color hidden &mdash; in a row beside the remaining deck of cards.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player fills her hand to five cards by drawing from the four cards on display, then refills the card display from the deck. Using the number now visible on the top card of the deck, each player can choose to cross off one instance of this number in one row on her scoresheet. The active player then plays 1-3 cards from her hand, all of which must be the same color. She can cross off the numbers on these cards &mdash; but only if at most one number is missing in the series of numbers to be crossed off. For example, if she discards 2, 3 and 5 in blue, she can cross off these three numbers (assuming that she hasn't crossed off any blue numbers previously); if she discards 2, 3, and 6 in blue, then she can cross off the 2, the 3, the 2 and 3, or the 6.&#10;&#10;If a player has crossed off five numbers in a color, then she can cross off the rightmost number (2 or 12) should the opportunity arise; if she does, she also crosses off a lock token in this color. If the active player can't cross off a number during her turn, she must mark a penalty box.&#10;&#10;When a player has &quot;locked&quot; two colors on her scoresheet or marked off four penalty boxes, the game ends. Each player tallies her score in each color &mdash; the more numbers crossed off, the more you score &mdash; then sums these totals and subtracts any penalty points. Whoever scores the most points wins!&#10;&#10;For a variant, Qwixx: Das Kartenspiel includes eleven multicolored joker cards, also numbered 2-12, that are shuffled into the deck. A player determines the color of this card only when playing it on her turn.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Two horrific murders were committed in London at the end of 1888. The victims were Emma Smith and Martha Tabram. That autumn, for three months, Whitechapel, in East London, was terrorized by a serial killer who came to be known as Jack the Ripper.&#10;&#10;After committing five more murders, he suddenly stopped. Scotland Yard never solved the case and, to this day, the identity of the killer remains a mystery.&#10;&#10;The players will personify some of the main characters of this horrific drama: they will be investigators, suspects, or both. One of them will secretly be Jack the Ripper and will have to escape, alone or with some help before being revealed and arrested.&#10;&#10;London 1888 does not always rely on the same strategy in order to win. Roleplaying and bluffing is a very important part of the game. Every session is different and exciting.&#10;&#10;This is the second revised edition, which includes more cards, more characters, more options and revised rules.&#10;&#10;",

If two players are exclusively pointing to each other, they score, and each gets one point. If three players are all pointing to one another and forming a threesome they each get three points for their feat of sexual teamwork.

It is considered by some to be the battle that saved Western Europe from the Huns and, for the most part, put an end to Attila&rsquo;s wide-sweeping drives for loot.&#10;&#10;The Battle of the Catalaunian Fields was fought as the age of the Roman West faded away and the Dark Ages began. As Attila&rsquo;s Huns and their Germanic barbarian allies moved into Western Europe, leaving a trail of pillage and destruction behind and threats of more violence to come, the remnants of the Western Roman Empire joined with their former enemies, the mighty Visigoth tribe, to stop the deadly invasion.&#10;&#10;The two coalitions squared off in battle in the summer of 451 A.D. in what is now central France. The result entered both history and mythic folklore, as one of the last armies of the Roman Empire stood in common cause with their bitter Gothic rivals to defend their lands and their peoples from the marauding terror of the Huns.&#10;&#10;Game Data:&#10;&#10;Complexity: 4 on a 9 scale&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 6 on a 9 scale&#10;&#10;What's In The Box?:&#10;&#10;&bull; One 20-page full color Rules booklet&#10;&bull; Two 11&rdquo; x 17&rdquo; paper game maps&#10;&bull; 96 counters&#10;&bull; 16 Opportunity cards&#10;&bull; One player aid&#10;&bull; One ten-sided die&#10;&bull; One bright red, 9 1/4&quot; x 5 7/8&quot; Standard cardboard VPG game box&#10;&bull; One beautiful box cover sleeve&#10;&bull; One &quot;Wipes-A-Lot&quot; napkin&#10;&bull; One charcoal desiccant packet&#10;&#10;",

Ariadne the daughter of King Minos of Crete and his wife Pasiphae, fell in love with the dashing Greek hero Theseus. Now according to the myth, it was Ariadne who helped Theseus to escape the Labyrinth by supplying him with a sword to kill the Minotaur and a ball of thread to navigate the tangled passages&hellip;&#10;&#10;THREAD&ndash; An orthogonally connected group of five or more like color cards.&#10;&#10;The goal is to have the most points within your color threads.&#10;&#10;THE DECK &ndash; Remove the 10s from a 52-card deck and divide the rest of the deck into red suit cards and black suit cards. You will also need one Joker card with a different color back and a way of keeping score. Aces can be either high or low. An Ace can beat a King but a King cannot beat an Ace. Cards are ranked in this order (A-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-J-Q-K-A) A=1 or 14, J =10, Q=11, K=12.&#10;&#10;PLAY&ndash; Player 1 has the black suit cards and Player 2 has the red suit cards.&#10;&#10;Thoroughly shuffle each other&rsquo;s decks and return them.&#10;&#10;The decks are placed face down in front of their respective players, these are now the draw decks from which the players will draw cards from during the game.&#10;&#10;The game is played in 2 rounds.&#10;&#10;The back side of the Joker card will be the Minotaur and the face of the card will be our hero Theseus.&#10;&#10;At the start of the first round the Joker card is placed face down at the center of the tableau and at the start of the second round the Joker card is placed face up at the center of the tableau.&#10;&#10;Each player at the start of a round draws 3 cards from their draw deck to their hand.&#10;&#10;In round 1 the player holding the black suit cards plays first, while in round 2 the player holding the red suit cards plays first.&#10;&#10;Players take turns.&#10;&#10;On your turn you may take 1 of 3 actions:&#10;&#10;1.Play a card from your hand face up to the tableau or&#10;&#10;2.You may swap out the last card played with a higher ranking card from your hand as long as the lower card does not divide evenly into the higher card or the lower card is not one number below the higher card. Then flip over and move the swapped card to a different spot on the tableau or&#10;&#10;3.Swap out the Joker card with a card from your hand and then flip the Joker card over and move it to a different spot on the tableau.&#10;&#10;Players then draw a card from their draw decks returning their hands to 3 cards, this now ends a player&rsquo;s turn.&#10;&#10;&bull;Once players run out of cards in their draw decks they continue to play the cards that are left in their hands.&#10;&bull;The game ends when all the cards have been played to the tableau.&#10;&bull;The round is then scored.&#10;&#10;CONSTRAINTS &ndash; All cards must touch at least one other card either orthogonally or diagonally.&#10;&#10;Cards may not be played on top of other cards.&#10;&#10;You may not play a card from your hand to the tableau so that the playing area exceeds 7 cards in any direction, this also applies to moving a card.&#10;&#10;SCORING &ndash; The point values of the cards are as follows: Aces are worth 1 point, (2-9) are face value and (J-Q-K) are worth 10 points each.&#10;&#10;To score a round, add up all the threads in your color suit.&#10;&#10;If the Joker card is face down and is orthogonally adjacent to one of your threads you subtract 10 points from your score. If the Joker card is face up and is orthogonally adjacent to one of your threads you add 10 points to your score.&#10;&#10;Finally players add up their scores from both rounds and the player with the highest score wins!&#10;&#10;If after scoring both rounds there is a draw, play another round.&#10;&#10;",

The dice act as accuracy levels while the cards rapidly execute Attacks, Defense, and Special Moves. Each individual character has their own Character Abilities, Tactics, Basic Attacks/Defense and Super moves to change the flow of the game as well.&#10;&#10;In Capes and Villains, you are already in the heat of the battle. There are no preparation or equipment phases, no pre-planning or gradual movement into battle. Nope, you are there, getting your cape tightened around your neck or dishing out the pain yourself. Gameplay should seem a bit crazy and even spontaneous at times, but believe us when we say that under the mask is actually a lot of strategy.&#10;&#10;Another Alternate gameplay scenario includes multiple players going up against one Super Villain. &quot;Overpower&quot; dice are added to expand on special abilities of a character's Super Villain persona (located on the back of each Character Card) to turn them into a super villain caliber.&#10;&#10;",

To get the treasure player has to put crystals in appropriate colour and number into the tower. When player finds crystals he/she can take it or leave it on the board. Taking the crystal makes that player is chased by Cyclopes. There are few ways to avoid attack of Cyclopes &ndash; one of them is for example to put the crystal to the tower.

Players take on the roles of noble families jockeying for power amidst increasing corruption and unrest.&#10;&#10;Gameplay consists of players bidding against each other on a randomly ordered selection of cards, then playing those cards. Cards represent opportunities for advancement in Roman high society, such as the acquisition of government positions, the leading of military campaigns, or the construction of public works. Cards tend to grant players tokens  &mdash; influence, denarii or legions &mdash; and those tokens are used in bidding for more cards.&#10;&#10;Victory can be achieved either by acquiring a predetermined number of legion tokens and storming Rome or by having the most influence tokens of any player when the deck has been exhausted.&#10;&#10;The game allows for strategy as confined by the luck of the deck's shuffle as well as trading, player cooperation and player competition.&#10;&#10;",

The serial killer disguised himself and hides among the victims in order to witness the suffering of the victims in a sadistic sense. His goal is to secretly thwart the escape. The victims win the game by escaping the mansion before the game ends. Or the killer wins by thwarting enough people reach the &quot;safe exit&quot; and have them killed by the bomb.&#10;&#10;On each turn, a player can move to an adjacent room (given that he has the key to unlock the room) and execute the function of that room, which include: discover a cue card that points to the &quot;safe exit room&quot;, deter the bomb from exploding (if successful, add 2 more game rounds), cure poisons (yes, the victims started the game by being poisoned by the serial killer), and inspect other people's cue card. Players can also do generic actions such as giving room keys to other players, and so on.&#10;&#10;The game plays similarly to the Mafia/Werewolf family, but with the spatial exploration element on a modular board.&#10;&#10;The game is in Chinese only.

Springing through air ducts they silently merge with the shadows that dominate the building&rsquo;s interior. Each criminal tries to outdo the others and reach a vault hidden at the furthest end of the silent storage facility. However standing in their way are the two security guards of the Shadow Shift who relentlessly patrol the darkened corridors trying to apprehend any trespassers.&#10;&#10;In Shadow Shift stealth is the name of the game. Criminal players choose to guide their thieves, through the darkened maze of corridors using subterfuge, bluffs, misdirection and cunning to be the first to reach the vault doors. The Security Guards player must use his two Guards and powers of deduction to uncover which of the warehouse&rsquo;s many shadows conceal the criminals.&#10;&#10;The object of Shadow Shift depends on what role you choose. Criminals must get from the break-in point, one of four unsecured air vents, to a vault without being detected by a Guard. The Guards must find all of the Criminals before any of them reaches a vault.&#10;&#10;Shadow Shift is a point to point movement game where you either have to gaurd a vault or rob a vault. The gaurds spend the games trying to work out which of the many moving shadows are hiding a criminal while not straying too far from the vault lest a criminal sneeks past. The criminal player spend the game shuffling the shadows, confusing the guards and them making a dash for the vault but only when the time is right.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In the not too distant future the hydrocarbons have run out! But not to worry, because nuclear power is here and it&rsquo;s totally safe&hellip; honest. Sure there have been some mishaps along the way, but today&rsquo;s super clean super efficient nuclear powerplants are a true wonder of modern science.  The technology has come so far so fast that it has left a trail of obsolete and faulty industrial sites in its wake. Don&rsquo;t worry though these relics of the nuclear revolution are nothing to be concerned about.  They&rsquo;re mostly away from the populated safe-zones, they&rsquo;re guarded by very competent Securobot staff and in a lot of them rad-levels are approaching acceptable.  It&rsquo;s in these crumbling industripolis that we find our setting for Atom Raider.&#10;&#10;Atom Raiders are the dregs of society, a kind of Atomic scavenger they trawl dead powerplants for the old unstable and yet very lucrative fissionable material.  Mostly it&rsquo;s locked away in huge old reactor stores and normally guarded by the stupid but formidable securobots.  The only law force that can put up with those kind of rad-levels for more than a few shifts.&#10;&#10;In Atom Raider misdirection is the name of the game. Infiltrating players guide their stealthy Raiders through the darkened maze of corridors using subterfuge, bluffs, feigns and cunning to be the first to reach the reactor doors. The Securobot player must use his memory and powers of deduction to uncover which of the abandoned facility&rsquo;s many shadows conceal the nefarious Raiders.&#10;&#10;The game play is very simple, but varies greatly with the number of players. The gaurds player has two guards under his control and may move them 1D6 each. If a guard managed to draw a line of sight to a shadow they can reveal it. If it contains a Raider then they are discovered and for them the game is up! The Raider players similarly have 2D6 which they get to use to move any shadow that they like. Could be the shadow with the Raider under, could be a bluff. If they make it to a vault with a Raider still undiscovered then they win.&#10;&#10;",

As a player, you must command your German or Allied forces so as to capture the objectives on the board while keeping your casualties down (and your opponent&rsquo;s casualties high).&#10; Using a fresh take on the venerable wargaming system presented in the D-Day and Market-Garden series, Battle of the Bulge authority and game developer Randy Heller has brought Paul&rsquo;s system up in scale to handle the larger operations in this campaign and provides the great (but manageable!) gaming &ldquo;chrome&rdquo; that wargamers so enjoy when exploring history using a &ldquo;paper time machine&rdquo; like Paul Koenig&rsquo;s The Bulge: 6th Panzer Army.&#10;&#10;Game Data:&#10;&#10;Complexity: 4 on a 9 scale&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 7.5 on a 9 scale&#10;&#10;What's In The Box?:&#10;&#10;&bull; One 20-page full-color Rules booklet&#10;&bull; One 11&rdquo; x 17&rdquo; map&#10;&bull; One sheet of 106, two-sided game pieces&#10;&bull; One two-sided player aid&#10;&bull; One 4.5&rdquo; x 11&rdquo; Turn Record mat&#10;&bull; One 6-sided die&#10;&bull; One 11&rdquo; x 17&rdquo; mounted, jigsaw-cut game map &#10;&bull; One bright red, 9 1/4&quot; x 5 7/8&quot; Standard cardboard VPG game box&#10;&bull; One beautiful box cover sleeve&#10;&bull; One &quot;Wipes-A-Lot&quot; napkin&#10;&bull; One charcoal desiccant packet&#10;&#10;",

If you said, &quot;CARROT&quot; you would score 3 points because C+A+R are 3 matching letters in sequence, common to both CAR and CARrot. If the Transportation Category item was AIRPLANE and you responded with the Vegetable - EGGPLANT, that would score 4 points because P+L+A+N are letters in sequence and in common to both airPLANe and eggPLANt.&#10;&#10;In the game, one player turns over a category card and names 3 items from that category. After each player has written these items in the left column of their answer sheet, a second category card is revealed. All players then have one-and-a-half minutes to find Common Ground. The player with the highest score advances. During the game, players use strategic option cards to challenge their opponents and advance along the board toward victory, but get ready for instant verbal challenges that occur whenever landing on an opponent's space.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Gathering Storm does for GMT's A World at War what Days of Decision did for ADG's World in Flames. It allows players to simulate the diplomatic, economic, and political maneuverings that preceded the Second World War, either as a stand alone game or as an expansion for A World at War.  (Unlike Days of Decision, Gathering Storm covers only the European events leading to war.)&#10;&#10;&lt;From the publisher's website:&gt;&#10;&#10;Gathering Storm, both a game in its own right and a prequel to GMT&rsquo;s A World at War, covers the period from 1935 to the outbreak of World War II, whenever that might be. Like A World at War, Gathering Storm simulates the military, economic, political, diplomatic, research and production preparations for the Second World War, allowing the players to explore what might have happened if:&#10;&#10;- Admiral Doenitz had convinced his superiors of the importance of submarine warfare in the impending war with Britain.&#10;- Germany had pursued the Z Plan earlier and more consistently.&#10;- The development of the &ldquo;Ural bomber&rdquo; had been pursued.&#10;- Poland had become a German satellite, rather than resisting German aggression.&#10;- War had broken out over the Sudetenland, or even the remilitarization of the Rhineland.&#10;- Mussolini had given a lower priority to naval armaments, to the benefit of the Italian armor and air forces.&#10;- France had extended the Maginot Line.&#10;- de Gaulle&rsquo;s arguments to expand and strengthen France&rsquo;s armor units had been accepted.&#10;- Britain had rearmed sooner.&#10;- Russia had deferred the Great Purges. Or accelerated them.&#10;- The Spanish civil war had been won by the Loyalists.&#10;- A civil war had broken out in Yugoslavia. Or Greece.&#10;- Atomic fission had been discovered earlier.&#10;- The Second World War had begun with a Franco-Italian conflict. Or a French pre-emptive attack on Germany. Or a Russo-German war, with Italy and the Western Allies neutral.&#10;- War comes early. Or later, in 1940 or even 1941. &#10;- YOU had been in command.&#10;&#10;Gathering Storm can be played as a separate game in a single session, with its own victory conditions, but A World at War players will want to press on and see how the war they have created plays out. While using different mechanics, Gathering Storm's structure is consistent with A World at War and allows for a seamless transition to whatever alternate war the players planned &ndash; or stumbled into.  Some 30 years in development, with three years of design and playtesting, Gathering Storm, includes the following:&#10;&#10;- Six random events each turn, providing unlimited replay value.&#10;- Economics based on tiles and activity counters, eliminating any paperwork.&#10;- Flexible mobilization rules, allowing players to emphasis civilian or military production &ndash; each at the expense of the other.&#10;- Unit construction which allows players to activate reserve units for immediate benefits, at a cost of limiting future options.&#10;- Variable research, which can focus on air, naval, military or intelligence projects, as well as short or long term gains.&#10;- A fast-moving diplomatic system, with each player allocating diplomatic counters each turn. Diplomatic targets are public, but the points allocated to them are not.&#10;- Shipbuilding that allows varied fleets, including the possibility of 5-factor super battleships.&#10;- Ahistorical A World at War counters, including armor units of different strengths and additional ships. &#10;- A dynamic crisis system, in which the Allies can appease or oppose the Axis, with neither side necessarily being certain whether war might break out.&#10;- No dice.&#10;&#10;Gathering Storm is a must-buy for any committed A World at War player, an excellent &ndash; and possibly dangerously time consuming &ndash; introduction to the A World at War universe for those unfamiliar with that game, and a enjoyable and instructive fast-paced game all on its own.&#10;&#10;",

For example if you use the chip 4 and the dice says 2 you move 6 squares.&#10;- When you begin the next lap you have to change the chip, which can not  be reused. Just one chip per lap.&#10;- Each competitor must pass through boxes 2 times, and roll a dice to see if you lose 1, 2 or 0 turns.&#10;The movement of squares is forward and aside. The only thing that is not allowed is to return to the same box, move back, and pass over the other cars .&#10;&nbsp;- Each player receives 5 &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;cards to start the game  the cards can be replaced when you finish the all, or whe you pass to another lap.&#10;- When there is a situation of overtaking, cards are played to decide the outcome of the maneuver, which depends on the difference in number between the two players.&#10;- There are wild cards that help you during the race to move more squares or to prevent overtaking&#10;&#10;Card Game&#10;&#10;There is a pack containing the following cards :&#10;- 6 sets of cards, each set has the color of one of the cars, and are numbered from 1 to 6 ,  the total is 36 cards.&#10;4 lots of 4 wild cards, giving a total of 16 cards&#10;The total of the deck is 52 cards.&#10;&#10;Dice&#10;There are two types of dice:&#10;Dice to move. Numbered from 1 to 3 and is together with the chip what determines how many squares  you move per turn.&#10;Boxes dice. Is numbered from 0 to 2 and determines how many turns you remain in boxes.&#10;&#10;",

The Relics were broke apart and scattered through the dungeon's 5 chambers. Once inside, though no one can leave until all of the chambers are free of Relic Cards.  The Players will need to find the two parts of each Rlic to make a match, allowing them to utilize it's magic (+1 Combat for instance).  While exploring the Dungeon, the Players will come across a host of Monsters, trapped within the Dungeon with them.  They must also evade devious Traps, evade diabolical Shadow Magic, find secret doors, and hunt for helpful potions to help them along the way.  Will the Players help one another survive and escape, or will they attempt to match the most Relics?  They may have to do both.&#10;&#10;Players will have two different colored dice that they will roll at the start of their turn.  One is for movement, the other, the Dungeon Dice, will determine whether a player will have to draw a card from the Dungeon Deck, based upon 2 numbers from 1 to 6 that each player must choose at the beginning of the game.  When one of the five chambers is emptied of it's contents, it will collapse, never to hold a card again.  Each time a collapse occurs, the players must add another chosen number, increasing their chance of drawing from the Dungeon Deck.  Once all chambers are free from Relic Cards, the exits will open allowing Players to leave.&#10;&#10;Players can decide the ultimate victory for their play.  Simply escaping the dungeon, making the most matches, being the last one alive are all valid goals for which to strive.  A standard win however, is to escape the dungeon with the most matches.&#10;&#10;",

More advanced buildings require less advanced buildings to be completed first, structured around a low-impact, discoverable tech tree.&#10;&#10;The graphics contain paths and other elements that allow players to position the cards to create an aerial view of their village over the course of the game.

A traffic signal is three consecutive discs in a line, in the formation red-yellow-green.  The catch is that one player plays red, and the other plays green; the yellow discs are neutral, and never move &mdash; other than being removed upon formation of a traffic signal.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you must perform the following three steps in order:&#10;&#10;     Move one of your discs.&#10;     Move one of your opponent's discs (except the one she just put into play).&#10;     Add one of your discs, but not in such a way as to directly create any traffic signals.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;The movement rules on the triangular grid are as follows:&#10;&#10;     The disc moves in a straight line along the lines of the grid.&#10;     The number of spaces it moves is equal to the total number of discs in that line.&#10;     Each time the disc reaches an obstruction, it must change direction, as you wish (but not 180&deg;).&#10;     It must be able to move its full movement, or it can't be move.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Each time a player forms a traffic signal, she removes the discs from the board, keeps the yellow as a prize, and gives the red and green back their respective owners.  As soon as one of the players has captured half or more of the yellow discs, she wins!&#10;&#10;",

In a round, each player plays each card one by one by (1) adding it as a new separate animal, (2) adding it to a pile as another animal of an existing type, or (3) flipping the card to reveal its property, then placing it under an existing animal stack to grant its power (or drawback) to the animals in that stack.&#10;&#10;In the climate phase that follows, the first player lays out colored cubes to represent how much food is available in this round (red chips), how many refugees are present (green chips), and how many parasites appeared (black chips). Players then distribute chips, placing red and green chips on their own creatures to support them and placing black chips on opponents' creatures or on predators that want to feed on their animals. During the extinction phase that follows, unfed animals die as do animals attacked by parasites or predators.&#10;&#10;Players then get a new deck of cards and the game continues with a new round. When the deck runs out and the final round ends, players scores two points for each of their living animals, one point for each property, and any bonuses from card combinations. Whoever has bred the most successful species in a constantly changing and dangerous world wins!&#10;&#10;",

It pits between two and six characters per side against each other in perhaps a minute of frantic, close-quarters combat action. Do not be distracted by the name. The game is set in Normandy (during the close-quarters hedgerow fighting between American and German soldiers), but these rules can be used and played anywhere during WWII.&#10;&#10;The main rules deal with the Normandy fighting and the equipment used there, but the Appendices include profiles for other weapons, including those used in other theaters (such as Russia) and at other times during the war.&#10;&#10;The game is d100-based, and uses 54mm figures, with conversion rules for 28mm and 20mm scales.&#10;&#10;",
