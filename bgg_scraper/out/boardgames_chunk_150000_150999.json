From the initial D-Day drops, on June 6th, to the fighting in the Norman bocage, and on to Operation Market Garden, this combination of Band of Heroes and its expansion, Swift &amp; Bold, arrives at the battle heavy, with 30 scenarios, over 650 die-cut counters, and the latest v4.1 rules. Command audacious American and British paratroopers and glider troops in daring missions against stalwart defensive positions and fiendish counterattacks by the German Wehrmacht, SS, and Fallschirmj&auml;gers.&#10;&#10;Infantry squads and intrepid individuals, such as skilled Leaders and Heroes, are at the core of the LnL Tactical Series. With them you can fire M1919A4, Vickers, MG34, and MG42 machine guns; take aim at approaching tanks with Bazookas, Piats, and Panzerfausts; and find the range with heavy mortars and numerous anti-tank guns, from the American 57mm to the dreaded German 88mm. Vehicles, especially tanks, also clatter onto the battlefield to take on pesky infantry and, of course, each other. M4A1 Shermans, M5A1 Stuarts, Fireflies, and Cromwells square off against Panzer IIIs and IVs as well as the big cats: Panthers and Tigers.&#10;&#10;Heroes of Normandy has 30 scenarios and tell the battles of the men from the 101st Airborne, 82nd Airborne, British 6th Airborne, 17th SS Panzergrenadier, 6th Fallschirmjager, 91st Airlanding, and 352nd Infantry Divisions.  The scenarios cover battles spanning the D-Day drops, fighting the Norman hedgerows, and Operation Market Garden.&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s squad-level tactical combat at its most exciting!&#10;&#10;UPDATE: All of our manuals and guides can be Downloaded, Viewed, and even printed right from our LnLP Online Library: We now have an Online Library of all, well almost all of our manuals.

        "description": "In Tiger Leader, you're in command of a German Kampfgruppe of tanks, armored cars, trucks, halftracks and supporting infantry. Your Kampfruppe may also be assigned air support and heavy weapons support in order to achieve your goals. Your goals are to take your objectives while trying to keep as many of your men alive as possible during realistic tactical missions.&#10;&#10;Tiger Leader features nine historical campaigns that can be played as individual campaigns or linked to form one huge mega-campaign that follows your troops from the Invasion of Poland to the final battles on the Eastern and Western fronts. The scheduled campaigns include:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Invasion of Poland 1939&#10;    The Battle for France 1940&#10;    The Battle for North Africa 1941&#10;    The Invasion of Russia 1941&#10;    The Battle for North Africa 1942&#10;    The Fight for Italy 1943&#10;    The Fight for Russia 1943&#10;    The Days of D-Day 1944&#10;    The Final Days in Berlin 1945&#10;&#10;&#10;A major part of the game is mission planning. You decide which vehicles and infantry units to use and which commanders are best for the mission. Vehicle and infantry commanders are rated for skill level and even personality quirks such as how well they keep their heads while under fire. Deciding which commanders are used for each mission is a major consideration. Your units will become fatigued with every mission. If you push a commander and his men too hard, his skills will degrade. Your commanders and their crew also gain experience with every mission. This makes for some great decision-making. Should you keep fighting with your top commanders and crew and further fatigue them to get the job done, or let the new guys fight in order to prep them for the tough missions ahead?&#10;&#10;Missions are quickly resolved using an area movement system to display tactical combat. Speed and realism take top priority in this game. Terrain cards randomly generate each battlefield. Double sided terrain tiles provide everything from cities and farmland to snow covered forests and hills to sand dunes and oases.&#10;&#10;During combat, you get to resolve every fight with enemy tanks, infantry, anti-tank guns, and squads of infantry. Each enemy tank, truck, infantry, etc is represented by its own counter on the battlefield. A unique fog of war system adds to the tension of the combat as unless you have a clear line of site to the enemy, you may not know exactly what is coming out of the morning fog towards your tanks until it&rsquo;s too late.&#10;&#10;After combat, you can rest and refit your vehicles and infantry. As new technology becomes available, you can replace older obsolete tanks with newer and deadlier models such as the Tiger, Panther and even the deadly King Tiger! If you&rsquo;ve played Hornet Leader, Phantom Leader or Thunderbolt/Apache Leader, you&rsquo;ll make an easy transition into Tiger Leader.&#10;&#10;We&rsquo;ve included the cards for every commander to progress in experience from Newbie, to Green, Average, Skilled, Veteran, and Ace!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Following on the success of No Retreat! where the Russian Front of World War II beckons, and then taking the action to the African Front, game designer Carl Paradis and his trusty developer Alan Emrich have teamed up yet again to present the third chapter in this game series, No Retreat 3: The French &amp; Polish Fronts.&#10;&#10;The &ldquo;Phony War&rdquo; ended in May of 1940 as the German Army unleashed blitzkrieg attacks into Holland, Belgium and Luxembourg in preparation for their audacious plan to invade France. Dubbed &ldquo;Case Yellow&rdquo; (Fall Gelb), it relied on a surprise attack with armored forces through the Ardennes Forest that the French had deemed impenetrable. A German staff study proved otherwise, and their panzers were pushed through this broken wooded terrain with deft speed, catching the Allies by surprise with their appearance.&#10;In No Retreat 3, players command the Allied (French and British) or German forces, operating them in accordance to one of several historical plans (represented by Plan cards). Manoeuvring forces over hexes that are approximately 30 kilometers across, over turns that represent 4 days of real time each, the vaunted No Retreat series card-assisted game systems are there to create on-map puzzles around each hex, unit and battle as the tense engagements rage back-and-forth and nothing is entirely predictable.&#10;&#10;Designer Carl Paradis has made an exhaustive study to answer the question, &ldquo;Could France have staved off total defeat in 1940?&rdquo; His research yields a resounding, &ldquo;Yes!,&rdquo; and the simulation elements of No Retreat 3, combined with its novel gameplay elements, offer a rich and insightful presentation of this controversial military campaign that shaped the trajectory of World War II.&#10;&#10;Bonus Game&#10;But wait, there is more! For this deluxe edition, complete with a 2-sided mounted map and oversized counters, the 1939 Polish Campaign was also added.&#10;&#10;This little-simulated battle will see many new concepts implemented into the &ldquo;No Retreat!&rdquo; game system. Given that both sides had never seen battle before and the units were mostly untried and green, a &ldquo;Fog of War&rdquo; game system is in use, adding much replayability to this simulation. Since that this game is fast, a complete contest will consist of two plays, with each gamer taking both sides in turn, trying to best the opponent&rsquo;s performance. Some intriguing &ldquo;what if&rdquo; hypothetical historical options are also added: Could have France intervened more effectively, the USSR acted differently? What if Czechoslovakia was never taken over by the Nazis? Poland better prepared? All these and more are yours to try out. No Retreat!&#10;&#10;French Front Scenario Listing&#10;Regular Game: The May/June 1940 campaign, but with an added twist. Both players will draw/choose a &ldquo;Campaign Plan Card&rdquo; that will instruct them as to their general objectives. There are over 6 different cards from each side, all taken from actual historical plans; the success of which will add critical Victory Points if the game does not end in &ldquo;Sudden death&rdquo;. What if Hitler had attacked in winter 1939 like initially planned? Or the French Air Force had been better prepared?&#10;Historical Game:  The May/June 1940 campaign, but with the Plan choices limited to the more historically plausible alternatives.&#10;Simulation Game: Both sides will be given the plans/set-up used during the actual campaign. Fall Gelb no5 for the Germans, Plan Dyle A or B for the French. The game also starting with the offensive already underway, Liege taken and Holland invaded.&#10;Operation Dynamo: In this scenario the German &ldquo;Sickle cut&rdquo; maneuverer towards the sea is almost completed! As the Allies, will you be able to save the British expeditionary Corps, evacuating it at Dunkirk, or even better, pierce the enemy lines and re-join the main French Army down south?&#10;&#10;Polish Front Scenario Listing&#10;Regular Game: The September 1939 campaign, but with extra choices. Both players will secretly deploy most of their troops on smaller strategic maps. One side or the other could have some extra &ldquo;initiative&rdquo; choices for the deployment of their troops.&#10;Historical Game:  The September 1939 campaign, with the exact historical set-ups of both forces. For this contest the players will take each side in turns. So the scenario will be played two times.&#10;Alternative History game: Players will explore many &ldquo;what-if&rdquo; alternatives. Some randomly determined, some planned by choice. That scenario will be linked to the French Front game and its outcome can affect the set-up of the latter.&#10;&#10;Number of Players : 2&#10;&#10;Ages: 14 and up&#10;&#10;Playing time:  Approximately 50 minutes for each scenario; 3 to 4 hours for a campaign game, 2 hours for the Poland mini-game.&#10;&#10;Scale: Each unit is one Army or Corps: Each hex is about 30 kilometers from side to side. Each turn represents four days of real time, except the first turn, which is only two days.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "(from GMT website:)&#10;&#10;Following on the success of No Retreat! Where the Russian Front of World War II beckons, and then taking the action to the African Front, and then the French Front, game designer Carl Paradis presents the fourth chapter in this game series, No Retreat 4: Italian Front 1943-45.&#10;&#10;This game will be using a mix of all the previous No Retreat! game concepts/systems, including some from the solitaire module, to depict this long and gruelling campaign with the minimum of fuss and the fastest possible play time. Each turn will represent one or two months (depending on the weather), but not every Turn will see major action! So during Frontline lulls very little combat, if any, will take place but for frontline attrition, so these turns will pass in a speedy manner. When a side decide to go on the offensive then that specific turn will see a series of moves/combat/activations (like was done for NR2); using a variant of the regular No Retreat &ldquo;Target/Counterblow&rdquo; rules and markers. The important sea invasions will be shown in great detail, the German fortified positions also, and the long set-pieces battles (like Cassino or Anzio) will be represented correctly without bogging down game play. Like in NR3 &ldquo;Secret Campaign Plans&rdquo; will make an appearance, with players vying to attain special high command objectives, thus getting bonus victory points if the game does not end in an early &ldquo;Sudden Death&rdquo; and continues to the bitter end.&#10;&#10;To make the play surface more easy to use, the long Italian peninsula will be represented by a series of separate maps each showing a part of the battleground. As the frontline moves north or south, players will switch the &ldquo;play map&rdquo; map to show the actual areas of operations, thus saving a lot of table space. It will also be possible under certain circumstances for players to actually change sides in the game (keeping their accumulated Victory points): Thus both will be able to get the chance to be on the &ldquo;attacking side&rdquo; if wished for; historically the Germans were mostly on the defensive. The Event card system will also be changed a bit, with each card allowing multiple possible effects/events: all the cards will be useful, even when the main event cannot be used because of Strategic Initiative.&#10;&#10;Bonus Game&#10;But wait, there is more! For this deluxe edition, the Invasion of Sicily will be added as a separate mini-game. Very fast-playing, and will be an excellent learning or tournament game; that can be also linked to the main campaign game. Could the Axis have delayed the Allies longer on the island? And what if only a token holding attack was made, with the main landings a short while later on the mainland? Or Sicily completely bypassed altogether?&#10;&#10;Italian Front Scenario Listing&#10;&#10;    Regular Game: The 1943/45 full campaign. Both players will choose a &ldquo;Campaign Plan&rdquo; that will instruct them as to their general objectives; there is a chance that one could also be imposed by the game system in case of failure! A players&rsquo; &ldquo;switch of sides&rdquo; could also occur because of the plans or player&rsquo;s will. The outcome of the Sicily mini-game can be linked to this scenario. Players can also change the Strength of the Armies and rate of reinforcements.&#10;    Historical Game:  The 1943/45 full campaign, but with the Plan choices limited to the more historically plausible alternatives. No switch of sides can occur. The Sicily mini-game is not used.&#10;    Short Early game: The first part of the 1943/45 campaign. Only the Southern Italian maps will be used, and the game will end in Early 1944 (historically after the Anzio invasion petered out).&#10;    Short Late game: The second part of the 1943/45 campaign. Only the Northern Italian maps will be used, and the game will Start where the previous &ldquo;Early game&rdquo; scenario stops, and continues until the end of the war in 1945.&#10;    Sicily Game: This mini-game can be played &ldquo;stand alone&rdquo; or linked to the Regular Game Scenario. It also makes for an excellent fast-playing Tournament scenario.&#10;&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE: 1 month per turn&#10;MAP SCALE: 10 miles per hex&#10;UNIT SCALE: Divisions&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;        One 17&quot;x22&quot; two-sided map&#10;        Two 17&quot;x22&quot; one-sided maps&#10;        47 Event cards and 8 Leader cards&#10;        One sheet of 88 round markers; 24 hex markers&#10;        One sheet of 88 two-sided square unit counters&#10;        Rulebook&#10;        Scenario Book&#10;        Player Aid Mat&#10;        Two 6-sided dic&#10;&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Carl Paradis&#10;DEVELOPER: Jack Stalica&#10;COUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch &amp; Charles Kibler&#10;MAP ART &amp; RULEBOOK LAYOUT: Charles Kibler&#10;&#10;",

Prevail over your opponents by learning the best spells and using that knowledge to outmaneuver and kill-steal in the dungeon, so you can gain admiration of the townsfolk, fame across the realm, and achieve Pixel Glory.&#10;&#10;In the first phase, the town phase, players will be drafting spells using an auction mechanic. Players will then take their decks into the second phase, the dungeon phase, where they will work together to defeat monsters; however, only the player that deals the lethal blow will get the fame for it. There is a lot of interaction and engagement due to players fighting over learning the same spells as well as fighting over fame.&#10;&#10;",

The game is an irony of life in Poland under communist regime at the 80's.&#10;&#10;The players impersonate the TV series' characters, that attempt to adapt to the circumstances, where the omnipotent &quot;Host of the House&quot;, Mr. Aniol (the name translates to: Angel) rules. Mr Aniol is a minor dignitaire of the communist party, that has temporarily fallen out from grace, but is ready to seize any opportunity to jump back to a more fitting position at the party's ladder (one of the players takes over his role). He runs the house at his convenience, keeping the inhabitants at check, invigilating them, organizing their lives, making them (or tricking them) to do his own duties for him, using them to impress the party dignitaires with his capabilities. The inhabitants, on the other hand, try to make their own lives in the block more bearable, preferably a bit comfortable too, and to ocassionally return Mr. Aniol the favor, undermining his position.&#10;&#10;The game is full of humorous situations and negative interactions. It consists of several turns in five rounds. Turn reflects day of life. At the beginning of each round, players choose the location to which they want to go and perform the associated action given a location (or a card on hand).&#10;&#10;Each character in the game has different bonuses and ways of scoring. First person who at the end of all the rounds has the most victory points.&#10;&#10;",

Each of these artists have traded in their pencils and brushes for battle armor and wands in an effort to embrace their inner swordsman, warrior, and healer. This exhibition of artwork celebrates each artist as a creator, individual, and a modern-day art hero and role model.&#10;&#10;Each artist's self-portrait represents a character in the game that players use to outwit their enemies, form their ranks, battle against foes, define their allies, and go to battle in the hope of obtaining influence and, ultimately, power over the fallen land of Vyk'Tornaahl.&#10;&#10;At heart Rolemodels is a poker variant with additional rules and flavor. Players start the game with five cards in hand. Three cards from the deck are revealed to form the Adventurer's Tavern. At the start of a round, the dealer rolls a d20 die to determine the amount of influence up for grabs. Each player then takes one of two actions on his turn:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Draw two cards, one from the Adventurer's Tavern and the other from the face-up cards or the deck.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Declare battle, which takes place in two phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Scout Phase: Whoever started the battle plays two cards (called &quot;Scouts&quot;) face up in front of him. Each other player in turn decided whether to pass or join the battle; in the latter case, they also play two Scouts face up.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Reinforcements Phase: First, a player can choose to surrender and withdraw from battle. All players who don't surrender, then simulaneously play and reveal three cards as reinforcements. Whoever has the strongest cards wins the available influence; in games with three and four players, the second best hand wins half this amount of influence.&#10;&#10;&#10;After discard all played cards, the player who initiated battle draws two cards, then a new round begins. When one player has fifty or more influence, the game ends and he wins.&#10;&#10;",

Players can plan ahead so that they will be ready for certain letters.&#10;&#10;This game is ideal for environments where players are extremely unmatched; instead of one player having to cheat to lose, all players work together and the timer can be adjusted to reflect the skill of the group.&#10;&#10;",

More than 40 different spells in 4 levels of difficulty are included.&#10;&#10;- Heroes and Champions (who may also be Wizards). These characters command subsections of the army, and may fight on their own as well. Their varying capabilities determine how they impact the battlefield.&#10;&#10;- Relics These magical items alter how units and/or heroes perform.&#10;&#10;- Fantastic Creatures The Bestiary covers 25 types, from swarms of bats to Wyverns. Many have special abilities such as poison, regeneration, causing disease, and/or use of magic.&#10;&#10;- Flight Some heroes may be mounted on flying steeds, and many creatures and even some units of troops may fly above the fantasy battlefield, raining missiles down upon their land bound foes, and/or swooping down from above to wreak destruction with weapons, teeth, and/or claws.&#10;&#10;- Starter Army Lists (18) These include many popular armies from other fantasy miniatures wargames and common fantasy tropes to help novice players get started immediately. The introductory scenario &quot;The Battle of the Black Valley,&quot; features an Orc army opposed by a High Elven army.&#10;&#10;",

Relive one week of your life in one hour.&#10;&#10;Remember how you said you wanted to be a writer? An artisanal pickle maker? Now's your chance. It only takes you two hours to finish your data entry, but management doesn't know that. Do you really want to make copies of copies all day? Why not work on your novel and brine pickles in the bathroom instead? You&rsquo;re pulling a paycheck either way. At the end of the day, players that didn't complete their tasks will be reprimanded, unless of course they can play an excuse to get out of it. Watch out for Wednesday, though, as there's always something that goes wrong on hump day.&#10;&#10;&#10;No Benefits is set in an average workplace, where players are average employees trying to get through the daily grind. You need to balance not getting fired with working too hard, in order to finish the week as the least productive worker.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to gain the most slack by the end of the 5 day working week (5 turns).&#10;&#10;Each turn, players will be given an assignment from the day's inbox by the current Assistant Manager. On Wednesdays, crisis cards are also drawn and dealt with. Players can then play morning memos, plan their workday by selecting Grind cards to play, and then revealing their selected cards to show their progress towards their assignments. Players with incomplete assignments can plead their case with excuse cards. Without an excuse, players receive a write-up, and are fired if they gain 3. Finally, any late memos are resolved and that round's slack scores are tallied up.&#10;&#10;The game involves a careful balance between putting off work for points, or doing work to gain sway and perks from your superiors.&#10;&#10;",

A 6 sided die numbered from 1-4 (1&amp;2 are doubled) is rolled and the number is advanced on the shops track around the board.&#10;&#10;If the player ends on a shop where he needs some good from he can claim it by naming the good and the amount of it (e.g. &quot;I take 5 sausages from the butchery&quot;). The player then picks the needed item token from the map and places it on his/her shopping list. The first player to collect all 5 items from the shopping list wins.&#10;&#10;",

Celtillus tried to assert authority to organize and ally the disparate tribes against Roman incursions, but tradition and habit were against him and he was killed by his own people. But strife with Rome worsened, and his son elected to try again for tribal unification to survive against the two threats of voracious Rome and ambitious Julius Caesar. The son negotiated, inspired, made alliances, and finally took on the traditional title of &quot;supreme warlord&quot; that his father had died reaching for.&#10;&#10;That title was &quot;Vercingetorix,&quot; and he bore the title so well that people today think of it as his name (which we do not know). But then, no Gaul ever bore the title again. Maybe you can change that.&#10;&#10;ATO #44 offers Vercingetorix: Twilight of the Gauls, a new game by designer Richard Berg, that challenges players to unify Gaul in around the 1st Century B.C. from 2-4 players compete for power in all three of the main Gallic areas. The Romans and Germans are NOT active players, but introduced with random and temporary control to interfere with active player intentions. Players draw chits each turn to improve their holdings, begin campaigns, or obtain more tribal allies. Or, they may draw surprising &quot;Opportunities&quot; that allow them to interfere with other players' turns and even launch revolts that could suppress Roman activities and elevate player esteem. Game length varies with number of players, but most games will last 2-3 hours.&#10;&#10;The choice is yours. Can you make the title &quot;Vercingetorix&quot; your own?&#10;&#10;",

The game comes with 5 Doraemon figures and 6 sets of 5 cards of the same color.&#10;&#10;When you play, you take Doraemon figures, one less then there are players, and put them in the middle where everybody can reach them. You take as many sets of colored cards as there are players. You shuffle all these cards and give each player 5. Then everybody passes one of his cards at the same moment to his right hand neighbor. When a player has a set of 5 cards of the same color, he grabs a Doraemon figure and calls out 'Doraemon'. Then the remaining player have to grab one of the remaining Doraemon figures as fast as possible. The player who wasn't able to grab one, gets 1 minus point.&#10;&#10;As soon as 1 player has 3 minus points, he loses, while all the other players win.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Guderian's drive south to encircle to Kiev / August 25 - August 27, 1941&#10;&#10;Armored Knights is about battalion level combat.  This offering, Guderian Crosses the Desna 1941, is focused on the German attack to start the great encirclement of Kiev.&#10;&#10;This battle starts on 25 August 1941, just after General Guderian goes to visit Hitler to convince him to allow the German Army to attack Moscow next.  Hitler decides that he wants to try and capture Kiev next.  He is mesmerized by the rich farmland and industry there.  Hitler manages to convince Guderian that Kiev is a better target.   When Guderian gets back he sets his troops in motion.  Their first test is to capture a major highway bridge over the Desna at Novgorod-Seversky.  His advanced elements fail to take the bridge in a coup-de-main on the 25th.  They regroup and make a more deterined effort the next day.  Aided by some inept Red Army bridge guards the Germans succeed and they establish a bridgehead.  On the 27th they must endure some minor counter-attacks.&#10;&#10;This is a stand alone game and an excellent introduction to the Armored Knights game system. Three scenarios detail the actions of the 3 days of battle.  The first scenario is small and short.  It's a race to the bridge in the German attempt to capture it in a coup de main.  The second scenario is the full 3 day battle.  The last scenario is the German bridgehead forces trying to hang on and expand the lodgement.&#10;&#10;The force structure is small enough for a great solitaire game and introduction to the game system.  System basics are an I-Go U-Go system with units being able to conduct overruns and engage in combat.  Unit strengths vary as a result of what supporting arms you stack with the battalion sized units.  Main combat units are infantry, artillery, and armor battalions.  Supporting arms such as recon, anti-tank, anti-aircraft, military intelligence, and engineers are built as companies.  Players are able to provide Close Air Support to aid the ground pounders and leaders like General Model even play a part in providing your troops with their best chance of success.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;&#10;    Game Turn: 2-4 hours&#10;    Hex: 1.24 miles / 2.0 kilometers&#10;    Units: Company to Battalion&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;&#10;    Four 11 x 17&quot; full color mapsheets&#10;    One dual-side printed countersheet (216 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;    One 26-page Guderian Crosses the Desna rulebook&#10;    Three scenario setup charts&#10;    Nine Player Aid Cards&#10;    Two 10-sided dice&#10;    One 6-sided die&#10;&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 4-15 hours&#10;&#10;(from publsher's website, box and user's desciption)&#10;&#10;",

The second way is if you control the most stacks of 4 pieces high at endgame.&#10;&#10;STACK - A stack is one or more pieces of either color.&#10;The color of the stack's top piece determines its owner (e.g., a black top piece makes it a black stack).&#10;&#10;Stacks cannot be greater than 4 pieces high.&#10;Stacks of 4 pieces high cannot move.&#10;Stacks cannot split.&#10;&#10;MOVEMENT &ndash; Pawns start out on base tiles on opposite corners of the board and move along the outer edge of the board. Pawns may move to any point along either side of the board, so long as they do not jump over their opponent's pawn and so long as they do not occupy the same side of the board between base tiles.&#10;&#10;Stacks move orthogonally along empty spaces(no jumps).&#10;&#10;Stacks move equal to the number of pieces within the stack. (e.g. , a stack of 1 moves one space, a stack of 2 moves two spaces and a stack of 3 moves three spaces.)&#10;&#10;Board starts out empty, then pawns are placed on the base tiles.&#10;&#10;TURN - Black moves first, turn then alternates.&#10;&#10;On each turn, each player must take one of the following actions, which constitutes a valid move:&#10;&#10;&bull;Move your pawn and drop a single piece onto any empty point that lies between your pawn and the target point as long as all the points between your pawn and your target point are also empty or&#10;&bull;Move your pawn and drop a single piece on top of a friendly or enemy stack that is less than 4 high, also the stack most be in line of sight of your pawn and any stacks in-between your pawn and the target stack must have less pieces than the target stack, or&#10;&bull;Move your pawn and then move one of your stacks.&#10;&#10;The game ends when neither player can make a valid move on their turn. &#10;&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The images and story for the game include the most famous tight rope walker of the time, Blondin.&#10;&#10;Charles Blondin is famous for first walking across Niagara Falls Gorge on a tight rope in 1859.  He would later walk across numerous other times and entertain the crowds by crossing blindfolded, on stilts, or with his manager on his back.&#10;&#10;Game board shows an amusing scene with a tight rope stretched across a river flowing down from a waterfall. Directions for the game state &lsquo;Ben&rsquo;, who stands on the cliff dressed in the sailor suit has already crossed safely.  The four walkers still attempting to get to the other side by way of the rope are named Ez, Uncle Tom, Fatty Fisk, and &lsquo;the expert Blondin&rsquo;.&#10;&#10;The game board also shows people falling from the tight rope and landing in the water below.  These are named in the directions too.  Ebenezer is tumbling into the water, only Nebuchasnezzar&rsquo;s feet are shown as he sinks below the water, Ezekiel is swimming to shore, and Jeremiah is said to be going up the ladder.&#10;&#10;The boat in the scene is named as well.  Commanded by Uncle Sam and carrying a small African-American boy, the boat represents the Freedmen&rsquo;s Bureau.  This agency was created in 1865 to help the newly freed slaves.  With the tight rope bridging the gap, and the dangers of failing, the game is seen to give subtle references to the post civil war era.&#10;&#10;Tight Rope is played by the spinning the indicator (earlier edition - rolling the two dice).&#10;&#10;To step on the rope (place his piece on space 1), a player must spin a 1.  To move across to number 12, a player must then spin the next number to where his piece rests.  This is done by spinning two times in a row.  If a player does not spin the number needed to move his piece one step ahead, the player then moves down the grid.  Whenever he spin the number needed (no matter how far down the grid he is), he moves to the number near the rope.  If the player does not spin the needed number and is in the last space below his numbered step, he moves back one step.&#10;&#10;The first player across wins!&#10;&#10;",

One for the action cards and on for the numbered cards. The numbered cards mostly works the same way as the action cards: If you can match from you hand the numbered card on top of the &quot;Number pile&quot;, you create an action. If your team has the control of the puck, you create a pass or shot and if you dont you can intercept or attempts make the save if you opponent shoots on you.&#10;&#10;A set of card in the deck serves as interaction between players to add more reality to the game and to give you an edge on your opponents.

        "description": "Skull King is a trick-taking game similar to 'Oh Hell!', 'Wizard', 'Euchre' and 'Spades', with players needing to state how many tricks they think they'll win each round. A unique element of this game is that bidding takes place simultaneously, leading to rounds that are sometimes over, or under-bid. As players must win the exact number of tricks that they bid to earn points, winning too many tricks is just as bad as winning too few and this leads to intense competition where losing a trick can be as exciting as winning one.&#10;&#10;Skull King uses a 66-card deck that consists of five Escape cards, four suits numbered 1-13, five Pirate cards, 1 Tigress card, and 1 Skull King card. The game lasts ten rounds, and in each round, each player is dealt as many cards as the number of the round. All players simultaneously bid on the number of tricks they think they'll take by holding out a fist and on the count of three revealing a certain number of fingers (or possibly a closed fist for a bid of zero tricks).&#10;&#10;Standard rules apply for the playing of cards, with one player leading off a card and other players following suit, if possible, and playing something else if not; however, a player may always choose to play one of the special, unnumbered cards &mdash; and the power of those cards might let you win a trick that otherwise would have gotten away. In more detail, the black Jolly Roger suit trumps the other three suits, a Mermaid trumps all numbered cards, a Pirate trumps the Mermaid, and the Skull King trumps everything &mdash; except if he appears in the same trick with a Mermaid, in which case she captures him and wins instead. An Escape card loses to any other card, and the Tigress card serves as either a pirate or escape card as desired by the player. Whoever wins a trick leads in the next trick.&#10;&#10;If a player makes his bid exactly, he scores 20 points per trick; if he collects more or fewer tricks, he loses 10 points per trick he's off. If a player makes a bid of zero tricks, he wins points equal to ten times the current round number &mdash; but if he takes even a single trick, he loses this many points instead. If a player catches pirates with the Skull King, or the King with a mermaid, he scores bonus points. Whoever has the most points after ten rounds wins.&#10;&#10;",

Ride the train! I'll be wandering about the park, and if you're the first one to find me, you win! Won't that be delightful?&quot;&#10;&#10;Rattlebones is a game about transforming dice. You start with standard six-sided dice, and throughout the course of the game you can remove sides and replace them with other sides that let you do all sorts of wonderful things. Every time you score points, you get closer to finding Rattlebones and, er, winning the game. Yes, winning! It's an experience to six-sided-die for!&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;Setup&#10;- Place the Rattlebones meeple at 55, 60, or 65 VP space (for 2-4 players). Players each get 3 d6 (black, white, gray) -- basic d6 but the '1' is replaced by Rattlebones.&#10;- Place random tiles on the empty spaces on the board.&#10;&#10;Your Turn&#10;Roll a die. May spend 1-2 gold to roll an extra 1-2 dice. Then, use each die one at a time:&#10;- if Rattlebones shows, move Rattlebones back one space; game ends immediately if it hits a player score marker and most points wins.&#10;- if pips or Rattlebones showing, move one of your pawns clockwise that many spaces (RB=1) and use the space you land on. Typically, you may add a die face matching that space to the die you used (replace any face except Rattlebones).&#10;- otherwise, take whatever action the face allows (e.g., earn a stock marker or star token, which you may later turn in for VP; earn VP; steal stuff from other people; etc.).&#10;&#10;",

To set up, remove the 7-10 in each suit from the deck. Shuffle the cards into three or four equal stacks, after which each player can look through one stack, then reshuffle that stack.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player draws the top card from a stack of her choice. If a face card shows up, it counts as a guard and is placed face-up on the table; any other card counts as cash and is placed in front of the player. (An ace also allows the player to look through one stack, then reshuffle it.) At any time during the round, a player can cash out, scoring one point for each pip on the cards in front of her and one point for each card face-up on the table, whether cash or guards.&#10;&#10;If a second guard shows up in a suit, then the round ends and no one still in the round scores for the cash in front of them. After five rounds, whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

Each player takes one of the factions and rolls all nine dice. Taking turns, players then either attack the opponent or use a special power. Dice that are used are placed into the dice cup. If a player cannot attack or use a power, he instead &quot;rallies&quot;, rolling the dice cup and simultaneously rerolling all of his dice still in play.&#10;&#10;The zombie dice are unique in that they have no rank 4 unit, and instead have an additional rank 1 unit on their dice.  However, they have several powers that revolve around gaining extra rank 1 units.  The wrestlers have a more standard 123456 ranks, but have unique special powers involving &quot;roll offs&quot; and &quot;tag team&quot; plays.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "From publisher's website:&#10;&#10;On June 25th, 1950, North Korean forces surged across the 38th Parallel into South Korea, starting what would become the Korean War. Within days the South Korean capital of Seoul had fallen and the Republic of Korea (ROK) Army had been routed. Remnants retreated southward and finally gathered around the port city of Pusan, where American troops had begun to arrive under the authority of the United Nations. Here on the Pusan Perimeter the U.N. forces would make their final stand.&#10;&#10;Korean War - Pusan Perimeter is a complete boxed game in the Panzer Grenadier series based on these fearsome battles. You do not need any other game to play all of its 48 scenarios. Design is by Jay Townsend, creator of our Saipan game.&#10;&#10;The North Koreans have a wide array of Soviet-made weapons, spearheading their attack with T-34/85 tanks. The South Koreans are fairly lightly equipped, while their American allies bring the tanks and guns that won the Second World War: M26 Pershings, M24 Chaffees and a blistering helping of air power.&#10;&#10;The game includes four semi-rigid mapboards, with art by Guy Riessen. The maps are fully compatible with all others in the Panzer Grenadier series (and those from Panzer Grenadier (Modern) and Infantry Attacks, too). Plus 517 playing pieces: ultra-thick, scorchless, sootless laser-cut piece, a joy just to hold in your hands. And 48 scenarios.&#10;&#10;",

During the day phase the players run through the garden, obtaining Fate Cards along the road. When a player reaches the resting place with his 5 pawns, the night phase starts. The players now race for the boat at the end of the vineyard. The first player who gets his 5 pawns on the boat wins the game. Fate cards, who resemble various Egyptian gods can help you or hinder you... The gods are unpredictable!&#10;&#10;Moving your pawns doesn't require any dice: the game uses Throwing Sticks ('Djebao' or 'Fingers'), just like in the old Senet game.&#10;&#10;",

Each player starts with two VludKin cards from different ClaNz, and their goal is to not have the lowest influence VludKin when the game ends, and therefore be the player controlling the Vlud.&#10;&#10;This is an original &quot;stack-building&quot; card game for two players, with a set of rules that are quick and simple to learn, but offering numerous strategic options and dirty tricks on the path to victory.&#10;&#10;Each player receives two random VludKin cards from different ClaNz, and during the game they draw a card from the central deck which they then try to win with one of their VludKin, rolling over that VludKin's Influence modified by the card. If this card is an Influence card, they can then place it under one of the VludKin, altering their Influence value based on the Clan type shown on the card. If it's a Power card, then they can carry out the special action on that card before it is discarded.&#10;&#10;Failing to win a card will earn the VludKin a -1 Influence token to their total, and they can get rid of these only through trading an Influence card matching their Clan or the use of certain power cards, which might actually move all the tokens to an enemy instead. If an Influence card is failed, then the other player gets a chance to win it. If a Power card is failed, then the power is automatically played by the enemy VludKin opposite; sometimes it's in your advantage to fail a Power card...&#10;&#10;During the game, the stacks of cards under each VludKin are built, changing their Influence up and down over turns until the game ends and the player with the lowest VludKin loses. With the ability to play Influence cards on the other player's VludKin and with the use of Power cards to move Influence cards around the stacks, a level of strategy is added to the simple core rules.&#10;&#10;The game ends when either a VludKin reaches ten Influence or the central deck is empty, so through the use of Influence and Power cards a tense game builds in which the balance of Influence can change right up to the end on the asymmetrical board game playfield. There is little down time for the players and no hidden hands of cards, so this provides an exciting head-to-head experience.&#10;&#10;VludKin ClaNz comes with eight VludKin from four ClaNz, two copies of each of the twelve different power cards, and forty Influence cards. Adding extra sets of the Power and Influence cards gives you the option to customize the central deck to how you want to play, and also gives the option for a longer game.&#10;&#10;Can you gain influence over the VludKin in this original card game?&#10;&#10;",

The competing Slashers don't interact directly, but the Writers have the ability to hinder or help other Slashers with the placement of new weapons, or, more importantly, manipulating the horde of Pawns (Victims) that populate the Slasher film tableau.&#10;&#10;You say that you love the idea, but that you don't have miniatures for a game like this? No problem! Included with the game are printable paper miniatures... you get 5 distinct Slashers, a Cop, and 4 distinct Pawns. Print as many Pawns and Cops as you need, snip, fold, glue, and you are all set! Also included are printable Weapon counters, and Pawn Special counters that introduce twists to the game like Phones (self-explanatory,) Beer (dangerous for Pawns), and Hysteria (AHHHHH!!!).&#10;&#10;Whenever a Slasher ends his/her movement in contact with a Pawn or Cop, the Slasher must conduct an attack. If the Attack is successful your Slasher removes the Pawn from the board, earning Collection Points.&#10;&#10;Collection Points translate into ratings, or popularity, for the Writer&rsquo;s Slasher and Slasher story line. So, earning Collection Points in the game, while preventing rival Slashers from collecting points when you can, is how you can win the game.&#10;&#10;Not recommended for children under the age of 16. This is meant to be a fun game, based on a movie genre, and does not take itself seriously... still, the subject matter may not be appropriate for everyone.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

In addition to managing their hand of cards and creating a cohesive runway look, players will compete in minor physical challenges such as lip-syncing in order to gain advantages in that round.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Les Guerres de Bourgogne 1474-1477 (Wars of Burgundy) is a historical simulation from October 1474 to January 1477. One player plays the role of the Burgundian armies and their allies (Duchy of Savoy and Italian states), led by the famous Duke Charles the Bold, and the other player is in command of the Swiss Confederacy and its allies (Duchy of Lorraine and German states). The objectives are to take control of the Savoy and Lorraine territories, win pitched battles or major sieges, and neutralise the opponent's allies.&#10;&#10;This is both a strategic &amp; tactical game with armies and garrisons evolving on the main strategic map and units fighting on a tactical map featuring a typical XVth century battleground. Units are men-at-arms, pikes, bowmen, crossbowmen, halberdiers, hangunners, and early cannons, from 2,000 men at full strength, 1,000 horsemen or 200 cannons of all calibers. The &quot;chrome&quot; of that period is added with tactical chits (charge, harassment shots, raining arrows, ditch, fence, clash of pikes, cannon battery) and events such as rain, snow, minor ally, no fight or betrayal, no wing deployment. Optional rule includes a possible intervention of the French kingdom to support one side or the other. You will be able to fight the famous battles of Hericourt (1474), Grandson &amp; Morat (1476), and Nancy (1477), the latter involving a fatal outcome for Charles the Bold.&#10;&#10;The complete sequence of a turn:&#10;I/ Burgundy&#10;1) Reinforcement, replacement&#10;2) strategic move&#10;3) attrition phase&#10;4) combat phase (battles &amp; sieges)&#10;II/ Swiss Confederacy&#10;Same sequence&#10;III/ Diplomatic phase&#10;check for victory&#10;&#10;The game includes 108 die-cut counters, an A3 size strategic and an A5 size tactical map.

As you battle opposing fire departments, pull out all the stops to gain control of the most districts by collecting equipment, sabotaging opponents, and successfully completing fire calls to win the game.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game objective is to become the Fire Department (player) with the most occupied districts by collecting and using the necessary equipment to complete Fire Calls. Once all the districts are covered, the Fire Department with the most occupied districts wins the game.&#10;&#10;On their turn, players roll the die and move their markers along the track. The space they land on can have one of a number of effects. Players may gain fire equipment, have the opportunity to complete a fire call and occupy a district, gain cards for special effects later or sustain on-the-job injuries and be put in hospital. Players will also gain ranks throughout the game, starting off as Firefighters and being promoted up to Fire Chief.&#10;&#10;When fire calls are completed by players, the corresponding district is covered and occupied. Immediately after all 11 districts are occupied, the game ends and the player with the most wins.&#10;&#10;",

Players run their businesses and try to adapt to the events of the period, all while helping building the fort Fredriksten, which will protect the city from repeated attacks from the Swedish king, Karl XII.&#10;&#10;Each round, you roll your dice and use them to activate your buildings. Each building can only be activated by a certain die value, and will provide money, construction material, soldiers, or victory points. If you erect buildings with different dice values, you will be able to utilize your dice most efficiently. Also, you can customize your buildings according to your needs by upgrading them with different combinations of cards, increasing or changing their production, or changing their required dice value. Contribute to the building of Fredriksten to receive extra resources, and make sure to have your private army ready when Karl XII attacks.&#10;&#10;",

They need to move through several sightseeing places and then end in the railway station to finish their mission.

Some of the locations are marked with red, and on those locations something special happens and players refer the rulebook.&#10;&#10;The game is most likely a fundraiser, several local companies are shown on the map and the special locations have references to them.&#10;&#10;",

Then, they draw five cards and play their move in turns.&#10;&#10;The different actions from the cards include summoning zombies, moving them to specific tiles to bring ingredient cards from one's hand to the table, or sacrifice zombies on the Altar tile to activate or deactivate ingredients already on the table.&#10;Cards can also be combined into advanced actions that bend the rules (steal cards, cancel actions, etc.).&#10;&#10;Rules are in English and French. Cards are bilingual.&#10;&#10;Comes as a printed-on-demand box or as a PDF file.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Flickin' Cars With Guns is a tabletop dexterity game for 2 or more players playable in as little as 10 minutes. Players use diecast toy cars (like Hot Wheels or Matchbox) to represent armed vehicles. The goal is to destroy your opponents by shooting and crashing into them.&#10;&#10;The game is meant to be played on a standard kitchen table, and you can use household items as obstacles and terrain. A 4'x3' table littered with plates, cups, and bowls is pretty standard. In fact playing a quick game after dinner, before cleaning up the table, is one of the funnest approaches.&#10;&#10;Each turn the player &quot;flicks&quot; their car twice and shoots once. The act of flicking is where the physical skill and challenge of the game come in. Crashing into an obstacle hurts your car, and accidentally flicking off the table is penalized as well, so players have to be careful.&#10;&#10;Shooting is done by rolling 2D6 with a to-hit target number equal to the number of inches to your target. So if your opponent is 8&quot; away you need 8+ to hit. Double damage on double 6s, and shots always miss on double 1s.&#10;&#10;There are several variants and optional rules that can be bolted onto this core system, such as droppable weapons, demolition derby mode, a drinking game, stunt bonuses, power ups, using playing cards, etc. to ensure plenty of longevity and suitability for all types of players.&#10;&#10;",

After diverting the previously allocated Army regiment to reinforce Guadacanal, it fell to the Navy to gather a scratch force to capture the &quot;lightly defended&quot; airfield on the eastern tip of New Guinea.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately for Japanese plans, those months of delays allowed Australia to finish assembling a brigade of Militia at Milne Bay during July, then rush a veteran AIF brigade there shortly before the Japanese landings commenced on August 25th, 1942.&#10;&#10;Several scenarios are included in Milne Bay to allow players to explore different Australian and Japanese plans.&#10;&#10;",

Each player then places his first eight mice in a 3x3 grid with the middle square left empty. The neutral mice are kept as a hand of cards.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, he can move one mouse one step. A mouse that moves into the middle empty square has escaped, and the opponent's mouse with the same number is defeated (turned over). Each mouse has a special ability that affects only the two adjacent mice; for example, the fighter mouse protects the adjacent mice from being defeated, the nurse mouse heals a defeated mouse, the speed mouse allows adjacent mice to move twice, and so on. Each time a mouse exits, the active player can place a neutral mouse from his hand on one of the corner squares, if available.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, players receive one point per escaped mouse, but some of the mice give an extra bonus depending on the order in which they escaped. This order is determined by the two neutral mice set aside at the start of the game.&#10;&#10;",

It can be played either cooperatively or competitively.&#10;&#10;Players start on the same &quot;Start&quot; card, and have slightly different attack, search and defense abilities depending on their character. On their turn, they first draw a map card and connect it to the already placed cards, expanding the caverns and creating more opportunities for battles and loot.&#10;&#10;Combat and gaining coins works through dice rolls. Players have to beat certain defence scores of the enemies in their roll, and they gain the associated rewards if they're successful. This can also include treasure cards which provide bonuses and extra abilities.&#10;&#10;Players can pool their dice rolls together if they are on the same space, to make it easier to gain rewards or defeat monsters. In this case, the rewards are split.&#10;&#10;Players can also attack each other for the chance to steal coins from their opponents.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to be the first to find 10 coins and make it back to the entrance. Each character has an additional secondary objective which provides an alternative winning condition.&#10;&#10;",

When all have placed, the seashells are turned up and resolved: Blue seashells can be taken only by snipes, and red only by the fishermen. If two have placed on the same, the latter will steal a previously claimed seashell from the former &mdash; but if both fisherman and snipe are on the same seashell, the fisherman profits according to the old proverb and both gets the seashell and catches the bird.&#10;&#10;",

However, in order to achieve a &quot;perfect rhythm&quot;, a note must be caught by a dancer with the same number, if caught by a dancer with a number at most 1 more or less than the note is &quot;good&quot; if the note and the dancer are of the same colour; anything else is a &quot;fail&quot;.&#10;Before each catch, the player can only move one dancer one step, either from back row to front row, or sideways, in which case they swap places with whoever was beside them. However, moving sideways to a spot where no dancer is is not counted as a move, and will also cause the dancer who now ends up in the same column as the moved one, to move in the opposite direction, a so-called &quot;cross move&quot;.&#10;&#10;Being in the back row gives the dancer one extra turn to catch the note. Also, apart from the current row of falling notes, the player will have another row of notes above it, enabling the player to plan his moves one turn ahead.&#10;&#10;The final score is decided by the number of perfects and good rhythm catches. Also, before each game, the player chooses which song to dance to; each song having a special effect on the game. Each dancer also has a special power to activate once per game.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The Ravens of Thri Sahashri is a two-player cooperative card game. One player is playing the girl Ren who has lost her memory; the other is the detective trying to repair it. The game is about trying to communicate as well as possible by simply the choice of cards. (Note: &quot;Thri Sahashri&quot; is the buddhist term for a trillion worlds combined, which in this case means &quot;the other plane&quot;.)&#10;&#10;Of a deck consisting of cards of five colors and numbered 1&ndash;5, the Ren player draws four cards and keeps them face down. The goal for both players is to ensure that when the hand ends, the playing field has cards of these colors and these colors only.&#10;&#10;Each round, the detective draws as many cards as he wishes from the shuffled deck, putting them on the playing field according to the marks on the cards. The deck also contains ravens, which when drawn will &quot;eat&quot; any discarded cards of that color and threaten to take them out of the game.&#10;&#10;When the detective player is done, the Ren player picks one of the cards in the playing field and puts on the leftmost still &quot;incomplete&quot; hidden card. A hidden card is complete when that card plus the cards placed on it total 7. (The fourth pile, however, should total only 5, according to the Japanese poem metric &quot;dodoitsu&quot; that goes 7-7-7-5.)&#10;&#10;Once all four hidden cards are completed, the round ends and unless the playing field has exactly the colors represented among the hidden cards, the players have failed. The game is played for three hands, but in the final hand, one hidden card must be completed per round, lest the players fail. Players also fail if the deck runs out or if all five Ravens are drawn.&#10;&#10;",

Dogma is a party-style card game simulating the back-and-forth dialogue between roleplayers and the game master in an RPG session.&#10;&#10;Each player selects a team of heroes from the available line-up, then receives six quest cards and a number of play cards that signify dice numbers.&#10;&#10;Taking turns, players ask an opponent for a quest; that player unveils one of his quests, then the asking player tries to solve the quest by rolling as many dice as he has heroes, activating their abilities to generate resources such as &quot;battle&quot;, &quot;magic&quot;, &quot;thievery&quot; and so on. Each quest has its own clear requirements, and if the player manages to generate the correct resources, he gains the victory points the quest generates; if not, these points go to the quest owner.&#10;&#10;After the dice roll, players can adjust the values of the dice by playing cards from their hands, either elevating, lowering or re-rolling the dice rolled. After this is done, the dice are applied to the lineup of heroes, activating different abilities.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Welcome to the Dungeon &mdash; first released as Dungeon of Mandom &mdash; is a push-your-luck dungeon delve in which 2-4 players take turns essentially daring each other to go into a dungeon with less equipment than they start off with while filling the dungeon with monsters. Players can win the game by winning 2 rounds or get eliminated from the game by losing 2 rounds. Each player has a 2-sided players card that has a white side and a red side. The first win taps the player card and the 1st loss flips the card over to the red side. A 2nd loss will have the player turn the card back into the box.&#10;&#10;The game is played in rounds. The player sets up the base character and all the equipment equipped. This represents every player as a fully equipped dungeon delver.&#10;&#10;Each round, the start player (the person who challenged the dungeon last or the last player to be in a dungeon) can choose to draw a card from the monster deck or pass their turn.&#10;&#10;If they choose to draw, they can do one of two things: (1) keep it and de-equip an equipment or (2) place it face down in the dungeon. Placing it face down in the dungeon creates the dungeon deck and fills the dungeon with monsters that the challenger will have to face later. If they choose to pass their turn, they cannot participate in the rest of the round. Once only one person is left after all the other players have passed their turn, that player then becomes the challenger and must go into the dungeon with only the equipment he has equipped.&#10;&#10;The player then flips cards off the dungeon deck and fights the monsters within. Some equipment allow you to null the enemy damage or be able to withstand it by increasing your HP. If the player survives the dungeon with at least 1 HP, they win that round. If not, they lose. The players then reshuffles all the cards to make a new monster deck and re-equips all the equipment to start a new round.&#10;&#10;The game ends when someone has won twice or one player is the last man standing.&#10;&#10;Welcome to the Dungeon includes four different sets of character cards whereas Dungeon of Mandom has only a single character.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Its not easy to be a Master of Evil. The working hours suck... Finding efficient minions is a pain... and keeping your well-earned treasure safe from the hands of the so called &quot;Heroes&quot; ends up being a full-time job. But... this is YOUR JOB and fame in the Inner Circle of Evil is everything to you so why not show the other Masters how a demonic job is really done! Masters of Evil is a game for 1 to 6 players where each player takes the role of an Evil Master that is repelling the attack of a variety of heroes trying to gain as much reputation as possible by imprisoning the heroes when defeated.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game 5 hero cards are dealt to each player so 3 can be chosen. Those heroes will be attacking your Den. Each turn a Monster is Summoned and you will have to place one of your minion tokens on one of your heroes that have that monster symbol. If you complete a card by filling all the monster, traps, and spells symbols you defeat that hero and can claim it as a reward by imprisoning him/her into your dungeon cell. Some heroes provide a special reward when defeated... from adding an extra monster to getting a special Overlord ability.&#10;&#10;After placing minions a die is rolled to determine if a type of hero attacks. To repel an attack you can remove monsters from that hero card for a value equal, bigger or lower than the hero attack (defined by the roll of 1D6). If you repel the complete attack you are undamaged. If you repel a portion you can get the rest of the damage by reducing your life (which begins with 10). Also you can simply nullify the attack of a hero by distracting them with one of your treasures. Spells can be used to change the summoned monster type and Traps can nullify any attack (even if they are not in the card of an attacking hero).&#10;&#10;When the 6th hero is collected by any player the game is over and the scoring phase begins. Players get the points in the hero cards but also get points for the most types of each monster and if they collect at least 3 cards of a Hero Type.&#10;&#10;&#10;No es facil ser un Se&ntilde;or del Mal. Las horas a las que hay que levantarse apestan... Encontrar sirvientes eficientes es un dolor de medula... Y conservar tu &quot;bien merecido&quot; tesoro de las garras de los heroes termina siendo un trabajo full-time. Pero es tu OFICIO y la fama adquirida en el circulo Interno de la Maldad lo es todo para ti... asi que porque no mostrar a los demas Se&ntilde;ores como se hace un buen trabajo demoniaco! En los Se&ntilde;ores del Mal los jugadores toman el rol de Se&ntilde;ores Oscuros que estan repeliendo el ataque de audaces heroes aprisionandolos cuando son derrotados para asi ganar la tan preciada fama.&#10;&#10;Al comienzo del juego se entregaran 5 cartas de heroe a cada jugador de las que seran elegidas 3. Esos heroes atacaran tu Guarida. Cada turno sera Invocado un Monstruo y tendras que colocar un token de minion en uno de los heroes que tenga en su carta a dicho monstruo disponible. Si completas todos los slots de la carta derrotas al heroe y puedes reclamar la recompensa aprisionandolo en una celda. Algunos heroes proveen recompensas especiales cuando son derrotados... desde otorgar un monstruo extra a darle al Overlord una habilidad permanente.&#10;&#10;Luego de colocar los minions se tira un dado para determinar el tipo de heroe que atacara. Para repeler un ataque se pueden remover monstruos de la carta de dicho heroe por un valor igual, superior o inferior que el ataque del heroe (definido por un D6). Si repeles completamente el ataque no eres da&ntilde;ado. Si solo se repele una porcion recibes el resto del da&ntilde;o reduciendo tu vida (que comienza en 10). Tambien puedes anular un ataque entregandole uno de tus tesoros. Los hechizos pueden ser usados para invocar un monstruo diferente del que se ha invocado y las Trampas anulan cualquier ataque (incluso si no estan en la carta del heroe atacante)&#10;&#10;Cuando un jugador aprisiona a su sexto heroe el juego termina y comienza la ronda de puntaje. Los jugadores obtienen puntos por cada heroe capturado, pero tambien por mayoria de determinado tipo de monstruo y variedad de heroes.&#10;&#10;",

Inside the camp you face certain death, outside the camp you face starvation, sickness, bitter cold, enemy territory, and even death at the hands of your own comrades. Struggle is life. In Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma: Camp 16 you play as either Prisoner #75044 or  Prisoner #44233, two prisoners unaware of their crime, and hungry for freedom.&#10;&#10;In this two player game, each player has a prisoner, and chooses one of three possible win conditions (Martyr/Survivalist/Comrade).  Players will take turns reading a scenario, then bargaining with their fellow prisoner to come to a conclusion about whether to choose a selfless [o] path or a selfish [x] path. Based on the combination of the two player&rsquo;s choices, players will take or gain damage according to the Results table beneath the scenario. If the players survive and meet their individual win conditions, they win. If they die, they lose. You must make good decisions to keep yourself alive, though sometimes that may mean making personal sacrifices in order to stay alive in the long run.&#10;&#10;",

Go back one step.&quot;), then moving forward or backward as dictated. Some cards require the active player to act out a role, then others guess who or what the player was trying to be.&#10;&#10;The game rules suggest playing as the opposite gender &quot;because this can cause some hilarious role-playing situations&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

To start, 3 cards per player are dealt.&#10;&#10;Example : you have 3 players and you decide to play with 3 cards. Take the numbered cards from 1 to 10. Mix them up, and distribute them face down. The last card is placed onto the table.&#10;&#10;The oldest player begins. He multiplies a couple of his cards and then announces the result.&#10;&#10;Example : the first player has cards 2, 5 and 8. Consequently he can associate 3 couples of cards : 2 and 5, 2 and 8, 5 and 8. He chose the first and declares : &quot;10&quot;.&#10;&#10;His opponents have to deduce which couple it is.&#10;&#10;Example : to obtain 10, you can either have the 2 and the 5, or the 1 and the 10. In that case, the second player has the 1 : thus he validates the first hypothesis.&#10;&#10;Players take turns in a clockwise direction declaring a multiple, until one player has identified which card is on the table. He says &quot;Deductio&quot; and declares the number of the hidden card without showing the card to the others. If he is right, he scores a point. If he can identify the cards in each player's hand without any mistake, he scores a bonus point, and the hand is over. If he is wrong, he loses 1 point and the hand goes on.&#10;&#10;The first player to score 10 points wins the game.&#10;&#10;Experienced&#10;&#10;Play with 4 cards or more following the same rules. The number of possible couples (for example, 6 couples for 4 cards) and the multiples related to each value increase.&#10;&#10;In turns, each player can play the joker card. He puts it in front of him and turns it face down once used. It will allow him to pass his turn once without declaring any number. It can be played at any time.&#10;&#10;",

Literal wars fought by private armies proved to be overly costly in resources, profits, and public opinion, so the Wolf &amp; Phoenix Marketing Conglomerate introduced an out-of-the-box way for corporate entities to resolve their differences: The Hostile Takeover Arena. Corporations that have reached an impasse in negotiations can avoid expensive, lengthy legal battles or risky sabotage by simply hiring a team of trained warriors to out-maneuver the competition in a quick, bloody, ratings-exploding spectacle.&#10;&#10;In Hostile Takeover, players control a mercenary team trying to outwit and outgun the competition. Each Character has strengths and weaknesses that must be wisely used to gain the upper hand. Can you lead your team of mercenaries to victory amid the chaos of battle?&#10;&#10;Hostile Takeover is played on a modular board (usually 30&rdquo;x30&rdquo;) filled with 1&rdquo; Squares. Force fields and other terrain features are placed on the board to simulate a sci-fi battle arena. Players each use their team of 4 mercenaries to accomplish scenario specific objectives that earn them victory points. The first player to earn enough victory points (determined by scenario and number of players) is the winner. Each scenario is specifically designed to bring all teams together in a flurry of combat.&#10;&#10;At the start of each Round players select an Action Card (Move, Melee, Fire or Aim/Overwatch) for each of their unwounded characters. Players also assign 4 Energy Tokens to their characters. Energy Tokens are used to boost the characters in a variety of ways and also enable the use of each character&rsquo;s unique Special Action. Players then roll for Initiative. Finally, players go in Initiative order activating 1 of their characters. This continues until all characters have acted or become pinned or wounded. There is a quick Clean Up step at the end of the round and then a new round begins.&#10;&#10;Ranged and Melee Combat checks are handled by rolling 3d6 and trying to equal or exceed a given target number. Each Character has a chart describing their ranged and melee weapons that quickly and easily provides the target number to roll against based on a variety of factors.&#10;&#10;",

Gain the most valuable collection of gems, and you'll be crowned the new dwarf king!&#10;&#10;On your turn, you draw two random gems from the bag and place them on the table. You then roll four six-sided dice. Certain gems require a certain number sequence in order to mine them; roll that sequence, and you can take all the gems of that type! As the game progresses, more and more gems will be added to the table, giving players choices as to which gems they want to try to mine. Sometimes you'll need to press your luck in order to succeed.&#10;&#10;Once the bag runs out of gems, you enter the final round, with players needing to do their best to snag the last gems.&#10;&#10;",

You can upgrade your mechs with weapons and accessories and then battle for supremacy in a fast-paced board game using buildings and scenery built from your favourite plastic toy building bricks.&#10;&#10;The first game in the Mechabrick product line is Gangs of Neon City. Set in the back-streets of a futuristic far-eastern metropolis the game uses durable plastic gaming boards (supplied in the game box) printed with a brick-standard grid pattern (4-bricks square) upon which movement and shooting range of the robots is measured.&#10;&#10;It's up to you and your imagination to build, change and rebuild the buildings and scenery on your game board from plastic toy building bricks and create your perfect battle environment.&#10;&#10;The game sets two or more players in a head-to-head battle of turn-based play using 'action points' to choose whether each robot should move, shoot or both in each turn. Customisation and upgrades to your robots are key to a decisive win, but be careful not to weigh down your mech with too many upgrades and make them too slow to fight!&#10;&#10;The printed rulebook supplied with the boxed game is only 4 pages long and is designed to be fun and fast-paced for all the family. We will be publishing free add-ons and expanded rules for the game to keep even the most hardened gamers interested for many years to come.&#10;&#10;The boxed game includes four of the 'Wakazashi-Class' mech kits (two black and two white), four plastic game boards, a decal sheet to customize your mechs and your scenery, two D6 dice and a full rule/instruction booklet.&#10;&#10;",

A special die is rolled and the event takes effect.&#10;&#10;5) ZOMBIE STEP: Depending on the levels of the Zombie Counter one or two extra zombies will be added to the Zombie Roll. Usually 1 die per rescuer is roll (between 3 and 4 die total) plus any extra die added by the Zombie Counter placing zombies in the suburbs of the map. A 6 rolled is a miss and do not adds any zombie.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to rescue the 8 survivors that stand hidden on the locations of the outer ring of the board and then return to the center tile to be retrieved by the rescue team.&#10;&#10;The Heroes lose if at any time there are 3 zombies on the central location tile.&#10;&#10;The Items deck works as a counter that will increase the difficulty as the game progresses with some &quot;bad luck&quot; cards that can be a devastating force against the heroes.&#10;&#10;There are several ways of losing the game and only one way to win so usually players will feel very rewarded when they win as it&acute;s usually on the edge of oblivion.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "&quot;Crossroads&quot; is a game series from Plaid Hat Games that tests a group of survivors' ability to work together and stay alive while facing crises and challenges from both outside and inside. Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game, the first title in this series, puts 2-5 players in a small, weakened colony of survivors in a world in which most of humanity is either dead or diseased, flesh-craving monsters. Each player leads a faction of survivors, with dozens of different characters in the game.&#10;&#10;Dead of Winter is a meta-cooperative psychological survival game. This means players are working together toward one common victory condition, but for each individual player to achieve victory, they must also complete their personal secret objective, which could relate to a psychological tick that's fairly harmless to most others in the colony, a dangerous obsession that could put the main objective at risk, a desire for sabotage of the main mission, or (worst of all) vengeance against the colony! Games could end with all players winning, some winning and some losing, or all players losing. Work toward the group's goal, but don't get walked all over by a loudmouth who's looking out only for their own interests!&#10;&#10;Dead of Winter is an experience that can be accomplished only through the medium of tabletop games, a story-centric game about surviving through a harsh winter in an apocalyptic world. The survivors are all dealing with their own psychological imperatives, but must still find a way to work together to fight off outside threats, resolve crises, find food and supplies, and keep the colony's morale up.&#10;&#10;Dead of Winter has players making frequent, difficult, heavily-thematic, wildly-varying decisions that often have them deciding between what's best for the colony and what's best for themselves. The rulebook also includes a fully co-operative variant in which all players work toward the group objective with no personal goals.&#10;&#10;",

The assumption is that they instead chose to evacuate as much of the French Army as possible to France d&rsquo;Outre Mer (Algeria). The resultant campaign, then, is one of strategic retreat and pursuit. The German player must try to destroy as much of the evacuating French force as possible, while keeping his own losses to a minimum in doing so.&#10;&#10;Both sides&rsquo; orders of battle are entirely historical. The game length is held to only one month because, had the Germans not triumphed in that amount of time, the delay thereby caused to their plans for the next year would&rsquo;ve then amounted to a major defeat in itself in the wider war.&#10;&#10;Each game turn represents two days.

        "description": "Modern War #13, Sept-Oct 2014&#10;&#10;&quot;The Next War in Lebanon&quot; is an operational level wargame of a speculative Israeli invasion of Lebanon in the near future. The context is an Israeli invasion with the goal of eliminating the presence of Hezbollah terrorist group, and presumes a much larger invasion than the 2006 incursion (which is also included as a scenario). One player (the IDF) is assigned the role of the IDF (Israeli Defense Force) commander, and the other player is assigned the role of the Hezbollah forces, as well as Syrian and Iranian forces if certain events occur to cause their entry into the game (or players may agree to have these additional forces in the mix from the beginning of the game instead).&#10;&#10;The game map features northern Israel and southern Lebanon, divided into 21 large hex territories, representing three categories of terrain: Urban (a major population center, such as the cities of Tyre, Sidon and Nabatiye), Populated (full of villages and small towns, and numerous roads), and Remote (rough terrain with few inhabitants or roads.) Stacking in any hex zone is unlimited, and units move and conduct operations within these hex zones to win the game.&#10;&#10;",

This is a solitaire game, played in scenarios. The player must accomplish the scenario&rsquo;s Objective, which will be generated at random at the start of the scenario.&#10; You, the player, must manage your carrier, its air group, and your escorts. As you operate your battlegroup, you will encounter various Soviet warships, aircraft, missiles, and unexpected opportunities and objectives. These are represented by Incident chits.&#10;&#10;The game presumes that you are seeing the situation from the bridge of an aircraft carrier. Hence, carrier operations are shown in considerable detail, while other US Navy and opposing Soviet actions are more abstracted.&#10; The possibility of running into enemy forces will be increased via the Alert Level, representing how much the Soviet Navy&rsquo;s command is concentrating its resources against your task force. When contact is made with enemy forces, you will go to the game&rsquo;s Tactical Routine to resolve combat. A scenario ends when you reach your Objective, where you must use your boldness to accomplish the final objective.&#10;&#10;",

But once a package is opened, up to 16 various Pilots (players) have stumbled into the growing conflict, and each turn shots are exchanged until only 1 leaves the battlefield alive.&#10;&#10;Each package (the game comes in booster wrapping to provide a random drafting feel similar to various card game tournaments) includes the instructions and enough randomly assorted Pilot cards for a full game of 2-16 players (16 players means that each player only gets 1 Pilot for a game, but additional packs or fewer players allow for more Pilots per player.) The front of each card includes their ship name, their health/damage values, and up to 4 actions (1 on each card edge)that the played Pilot can choose to take for a turn.&#10;&#10;Combat and damage plays out in a form similar to Rock, Paper, Scissors with a couple of twists. Each turn, all players play a Pilot card from their hand face-down, with the action of their choice being pointed towards the center of the group of players. The active player then chooses a target, and both of them flip over their Pilot cards and resolve the combat, the loser reducing and keeping track of their remaining health. If the targeted player has chosen a &quot;Pass&quot; action, then the target becomes the player in the direction of the Pass and they participate/resolve the combat instead. These steps continue until only one player has any Pilots remaining.&#10;&#10;",

(Yes, that&rsquo;s marketing hyperbole, but go along with us on this.) Zulu!! has no hexes, no squares, and is not point-to-point. It also has counters with no ratings. In some ways, it&rsquo;s like cardboard miniatures &hellip; with fewer rules. In that sense, it will be something new for many boardgamers.&#10;&#10;Using a slight variation of Ye Olde Igo-Hugo play sequence, the game system highlights the firepower of the British Martini Henry rifle, the value of a solid defensive position, and the greatly superior numbers of the three Zulu Amibutho (divisions) that gave them something like 40-1 numerical superiority at times. And all of this without having to move hundreds of counters around, another innovation. The map scale is 1&rdquo; = 4 yards. All of which plays in a couple of hours.&#10;&#10;",

After someone loses a life from the coin, the players discuss and vote on who to string up, and that player also loses one life.&#10;&#10;Players out of the game reveal who they were. The game continues until either the Werewolf dies (in which case the villagers win) or only two players remain, with the Werewolf being one of them (in which case the Werewolf wins).&#10;&#10;",

You have been commissioned to create a section of the Appalachian Trail, something that will eventually extend 2,200 miles through 14 states! It is your job to forge the best trail possible, with varying terrains to cross, scenic views, and majestic native wildlife. Unfortunately, others have also been commissioned to create sections of the trail and might try to stop you!&#10;&#10;In Appalachian Trail each player is given a section of the trail to complete. This is accomplished by matching up similar terrain cards to each other. However, your opponents might put an obstacle in your path, forcing you to change the direction of your trail.&#10;&#10;There are also trail improvements that increase the value of your section of the Appalachian Trail so that it attracts more hikers.&#10;&#10;Completing your trail first is important but winning is based on victory points which are accumulated through: trail completion, longest trail, set collection, and more.&#10;&#10;",

You are scientists and have been sent to an island to recover this precious mineral. Unfortunately, your hot air balloon crashes, with parts and equipment spread over the island. With your balloon badly damaged and your team separated, you must work together to survive and get off the island. Little do you know the island is not unoccupied. A roving creature senses your presence and hears your movements. Sometimes it will take what you are searching for; sometimes it will affect your well-being.&#10;&#10;Finding lost equipment will help you explore the island more easily. Each player can carry only a limited number of items, though, so you may be forced to leave something valuable behind so that you can carry balloon parts. To win the game, you must keep track of your team's health and get to the balloon crash site with the missing parts before the creature does.&#10;&#10;Browns Island consists of a modular board. Players start with a set of four cards, which are played to gain lost equipment as they move around the board. Some equipment gives them added advantages to collect parts for their crashed balloon. Players also try to avoid a roving creature. If the creature discovers a part from your balloon, players lose happiness tokens and must try to take the items back by using their gained skills (via action cards) and found equipment.&#10;&#10;2 - 4 players with a SINGLE-PLAYER variant.&#10;&#10;",

Players are pilots of various space craft and try to destroy the Dead Star before the enemy invades their base.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a 12x3 square gridded board. All players line up their crafts to the left, and the enemy crafts are lined up on the board's right. Players are dealt 5 cards each of which they choose 3 to play face down. When all have chosen, players turn their cards face up and the players execute their cards in order of speed on the cards. Players who end up having the same speed are blocked and their turns are skipped.&#10;&#10;After all players have done, dice are rolled to determine what the enemy crafts do (attack or move). If the players manage to reach the far end of the game board, they win. If all players are killed, or the enemy reaches the left of the game board, the players lose.&#10;&#10;The game also comes with optional difficulity rules, and one of them include a traitor mechanism.&#10;&#10;",

When players place three or more of their own cubes in a row, they score points. They can take a risk by aiming for difficult combinations and score more points accordingly.

        "description": "Marches of Mists is a fantasy board/card game using the exclusive DCSP (Dynamic Card Placement System) mechanic, created by Bruno Gaia and co-designed by Youri Faja.&#10;&#10;Using the mechanics of deck building, popular since Dominion, Marches of Mists widely differs from its ancestor due to the DCPS, a mechanic that allows and favours direct interaction while adding various notions to the placement of cards (like variation of speed in the player's progress on the board, disruption of the player's orders, targeting the opponent's positions, etc.) The DCPS is the result of years of research conducted by Bruno Gaia to find a brand new way of using cards in board games. &#10;  &#10;In Marches of Mists, players battle to slay enemy hero tokens and destroy the opponent's population. The game ends -and the counting of victory points starts- whenever a player's population reaches zero, four recruitment piles are empty or a player has lost his last hero token.&#10;&#10;The game is played by two players or any multiple of two, using an extra copy of the game for each extra pair of players. When more than two players are around the table, Marches of Mists is played as a team battle with phases of interaction between allies known as Councils; it is an epic experience that needs perfect knowledge of the game's cards and strategies, especially when more than four players are involved.&#10;&#10;Set in a singular fantasy world, Marches of Mists is currently illustrated by Camille Mazauric and it is the first game developed by Bruno Gaia with the help of Youri Faja, the designer of &quot;Requiem&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

ELECTRIC BOOGALOO&#10;&#10;// INTRODUCTION &not;&#10;&#10;In 1930, the Pabodie Expedition left for the Antarctic Continent to carry out Geological prospecting operations. &#10;Part of the crew died and some of its members returned suffering from terrible psychological trauma due to the unfathomable primeval horrors they encountered.&#10;In late 1934 all contact was lost with the Starkweather-Moore Expedition. It had followed in the footsteps of the first expedition, but all its team disappeared without leaving a trace.&#10;In 1937 the millionaire philanthropist Alejo Crow begins investigating these strange occurrences.&#10;On board the battleship Gigamesh, following the geographic indications hidden in the Necronomicon, the Crow-Yutani Expedition, comprising a select group of explorers and a commando of clone soldiers known as &ldquo;macutes&rdquo;, must face the sinister creatures that await them in the polar ice.&#10;    &#10;// OBJECT OF THE GAME &not;&#10;A cooperative game in which players must try to survive the attack of primeval beings and kill all the monsters. Players lose if the attackers completely destroy the battleship &ldquo;Gigamesh&rdquo; or all the explorers of the resistance die.&#10;All players fight for one common goal: defending the ship from the waves of attacks of 43 monsters that try to devour them.&#10;&#10;// GAME CONTENTS &not;&#10;&#10;&raquo; 43 monster tiles&#10;&raquo; 14 special tiles&#10;&raquo; 15 explorers with bases&#10;&raquo; 4 barricade tokens&#10;&raquo; 6 destroyed ship  tokens&#10;&raquo; 45 action cards&#10;&raquo; 3 dice&#10;&raquo; 1 board&#10;&raquo; 1 rule book&#10;&#10;&#10;En 1937, el millonario fil&aacute;ntropo Alejo Crow emprende una investigaci&oacute;n para esclarecer los hechos.&#10;&#10;A bordo del acorazado Gigamesh, siguiendo las indicaciones geogr&aacute;ficas ocultas en el Necronomic&oacute;n y compuesta por un selecto grupo de exploradores y de un comando de soldados cl&oacute;nicos conocidos como ?macutes?, la Expedici&oacute;n Crow-Yutani deber&aacute; enfrentarse a las siniestras criaturas que esperan entre los hielos polares.&#10;&#10;Este juego se basa en la novela Fanhunter: Las Monta&ntilde;as de la Locura.

Field Marshall Erwin Rommel&rsquo;s Army Group B had erected strong fortifications along the coast of Holland, Belgium, and France, including the French Mediterranean coast, creating The Atlantic Wall. The bunkers and minefields were backed up by some of Germany&rsquo;s best troops. Allied forces had been gathering in England and the Mediterranean for more than two years, preparing to assault Hitler&rsquo;s Fortress Europe.&#10;&#10;On D-Day, 6 June 1944, they attacked on what Rommel called &ldquo;the longest day.&rdquo; Success of the invasion was far from guaranteed, but the Allied victory on the beaches signaled the beginning of the end for the Germans in Western Europe.&#10;&#10;Paul Koenig's Fortress Europe recreates the war in Western Europe from the D-day invasion to VE-Day, what General Eisenhower dubbed &ldquo;the mighty endeavor.&rdquo; As the Allied player, you must choose a landing site and then get ashore with a successful landing. This is followed with a breakout of the beachhead and a drive across France, culminating with a deep penetration into Germany itself. As the German player, you must choose a wise defensive alignment of your forces, including hidden units, and hope that you are strong enough at the point of the actual landing to defeat the Allied invasion. If you fail at the water's edge, you must conduct an orderly withdrawal across France, constantly delaying the Allies, until you are strong enough to launch a winter counter-attack (historically, the Battle of the Bulge).&#10;&#10;What's In The Box?:&#10;&#10;&bull;  One 40-page Rulebook&#10;&bull;  One 26&quot; x 38&quot; paper game map&#10;&bull;  Three sheets of double-sided, laser-cut game pieces&#10;&bull;  Four Player Aid cards&#10;&bull;  One six-sided 12mm die&#10;&bull;  One white, 9&quot; x 11 7/8&quot; Deluxe cardboard VPG game box&#10;&bull;  One beautiful box cover sleeve&#10;&bull;  One &quot;Wipes-A-Lot&quot; napkin&#10;&bull;  One charcoal dessicant packet&#10;&#10;",

        "name": "The Trilateral Conspiracy",
        "description": "The Trilateral Conspiracy is a mid-level traitor mechanic game that typically takes about 90 minutes to play.  One player (by random draw) is assigned as the Protagonist and is the leader of a group of Heroes trying to expose the Conspiracy.  Another player will secretly start the game as an Agent, posing as a Hero.  Agents win when the Heroes lose.  All other players begin with a Resolve score between 1 and 9.  They start out on the Hero's side, but if and when one of the nine &quot;Conspiracy Expands&quot; cards is revealed in the game, they will switch to an undercover Agent if their Resolve is equal to or lower than the number of Conspiracy Expands cards revealed thus far.  Consequently some players who start as Heroes may choose to play as if they were already Agents right away, others will be Heroes to the end, and some may hedge their bets and try to play both sides.&#10;&#10;There are eight locations on the board that serve as potential centers of the Conspiracy.  The main goal of the Heroes is to identify which location it is, and then successfully infiltrate it enough to get the information they need to expose the Conspiracy.  The way to figure out which is the correct one is to infiltrate three other locations known as the Halls of Power.  If successful, each one will eliminate half of the possible locations and all three together will pinpoint it.  The twelfth location makes all of the other infiltrations easier.&#10;&#10;On their turn, players will typically do three things.  They will move to a location, play a card on that location if they wish, and then they can either use that location's power (to do things like draw or trade cards) or they can try to infiltrate it.  The purpose for playing cards is to make a location easier (or harder) to infiltrate.  The cards range from -5 to +5 and each location starts with one random card on it.  If a player chooses to try and infiltrate a location, they shuffle the cards on top and then reveal all of them.  If the sum of the cards is equal to or greater than a certain changing difficulty number, they succeed.  Otherwise they fail and may face a penalty.&#10;&#10;Successfully infiltrating one of the Halls of Power lets the person doing the infiltration discover one of the leaders of the Conspiracy which in turn narrows down the possible locations of the Conspiracy.  However only the infiltrating player gets to see the card and they may or may not tell the truth about what they saw.  Once the Heroes have an idea of which location is the center of the Conspiracy, they will try to infiltrate it.  If successful, they may take a card from their hand and place it underneath that location.&#10;&#10;The game typically ends when the Protagonist feels the Heroes have played enough cards under the proper location and calls an end to the game.  At that time the cards under the Halls of Power are revealed and the true center of the Conspiracy is determined.  Then the cards under there (if any) are added up and if the total does indeed meet or beat a certain difficulty (called the Exposure Level), the Heroes win.  Otherwise the Agents win.  The Agents also win if the deck runs out of cards or if the Protagonist is killed in a failed infiltration.  The Heroes can alternately win if the Exposure Level ever drops to 0.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Pandemic: The Cure, a dice-based version of the popular Pandemic board game, sets up in less than a minute and plays in 30 minutes. As in the board game, four diseases threaten the world and it's up to your team to save humanity. You and your team must keep the world's hotspots in check before they break out of control, while researching cures to the four plagues.&#10;&#10;Players roll dice each turn to determine the actions available to them. They can fly and sail between the six major population centers of the world, treat disease in their current region, collect samples for further study, and exchange knowledge to help them in their goal of discovering cures. Each player takes on a different role that has its own unique set of dice and abilities &mdash; and players must take advantage of their specializations if they are to have any hope of winning the game. The Dispatcher, for example, can spend dice to fly others around the board, while the Medic is particularly adept at treating disease. Players can roll their dice as often as they like, but the more times they re-roll for the perfect turn, the more likely the next epidemic will occur.&#10;&#10;At the end of each turn, new &quot;infection dice&quot; are rolled to determine the type and location of newly infected populations. If any region on the board is infected with more than three dice of a given color, an outbreak occurs, spreading disease into an adjacent region. If too many outbreaks take place, too many people get infected, or the rate of infection gets too high, all the players lose. If, however, the players can discover the cures to the four diseases, they all win and humanity is saved!&#10;&#10;Part of the Pandemic series.&#10;&#10;",

Unlike Werewolf, Templar Intrigue does not require a moderator, has no player elimination, and plays VERY fast.&#10;&#10;Players in Templar Intrigue are split into two teams &mdash; those loyal to France (and thus King Phillip), and those loyal to the Templars &mdash; and of course, you might not know who is on your team. After dealing out the cards, you go through a series of information reveals, then you start trying to sway Phillip to believe what you want the King to believe...&#10;&#10;After a certain amount of discussion and at the discretion of His Majesty King Phillip IV, one monk looks at another player's card.  This is followed by more discussion, then another monk looks and reports back.&#10;&#10;Once all of the monks have spied on another player and reported back, more discussion takes place, then at the discretion of His Majesty, two players are identified. If Phillip finds the Temple Grandmaster and the Archivist, then Phillip and those loyal to France (blue team) win the round; if not, then those loyal to the Templars (red team) win the round.&#10;&#10;As soon as one (or more) players have won three times, the game ends with those players being victorious.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "When the Civil War was taking place in America, an uprising broke out in Poland. The winter of 1863. Poland was captive, partitioned by three powers of that era &ndash; Austria, Prussia and Russia. Under the occupation of this last country, the embers of yet another revolt appeared and tore these lands for the next two years. Once again, the rebellious hearts of Poles were itching for a fight. This time there was no regular army. Armed with scythes and hunting weapons, Poles joined armed groups called parties to stand up to an unequal battle with the large Russian army. You yourself could stand at the head of one of these parties.&#10;&#10;1863 is an unusually dynamic card game designed for 2-4 players, in which our task is to put you in the role of an insurgent party. The party, which may include Scythemen, Shooters or elite troops of the Zouaves of Death, will engage the Muscovites in the historic battles of the January Uprising. We must take care that we have the right amount of ammunition, and make sure that none of our fellow players gain too many glory points. They decide which player wins the whole game.&#10;&#10;One begins the game having five Command Cards and Ammunition Chips. Each round starts by drawing commanders and issuing a battlefield with the Muscovite&rsquo;s card hidden beneath it. In each turn, players replenish their number of chips and cards. After this, the most important part of the game begins. It consists of adding the next military units and actions to battles or to other players, in order to break with military force all the units of the battlefield, along with the Muscovite card hidden beneath it. The battles are resolved when everyone has agreed not to add more cards. If players manage to surpass the total military forces of the battlefield and Muscovite, the skirmish has been won, and the players each receive glory points according to the size of their military contribution to it. So it pays to have the largest share in each battle. The game usually lasts until 6 skirmishes have been won. The glory points are then added up, and the winner of the game emerges.&#10;&#10;&#10;Zima roku 1863. Zniewolona Polska, pod zaborami trzech pot&#196;&#153;g tamtego okresu - Austrii, Prus i Rosji.

Emil has got himself into trouble once again and therefor finds himself in the tool shed, carving his wooden figures. However, over the course of his mischieveous childhood the wooden figures have become rather numerous and Emil has trouble fitting them all on his shelf.&#10;&#10;The game Emil: Stapla tr&auml;gubbar (Emil: Pile up the figures) is about piling the figures and trying to be the player who places the last figure on top of the pile without making it fall.&#10;&#10;The players take turns drawing figures from a bag and try to place the figures on top of the pile in any way they want, as long as the figures don't touch the table.&#10;A player that causes any figures to fall has to collect the fallen figures except from one that goes back into the bag. The player must then use the figures from his/her own collection before drawing from the bag again. The player who places the last figure from the bag onto the pile without it falling is the winner.&#10;&#10;The game is very fast and suits ages 3 and up.&#10;&#10;Even though the box states 1-6 players, there is no real limit to the amount of players since everyone draws from the bag.&#10;&#10;The game also offers a solo play version where a player can try to break different records, such as widest structure or highest structure or most figures.&#10;&#10;",

Outbreak: Like in the classic game, the goal is to find as many pairs as possible. However, when it's his or her turn, the player turns over cards for as long as the cards are of the same type (i.e. human or zombie). Only when a differing card type is upturned the round ends.&#10;&#10;2. Survivor: Find as many human survivors as possible and keep them alive until the end of the game.&#10;&#10;3.

The game employs on-hand measuring devices, namely player's feet, to gauge movement and attack distances, and makes use of a custom paper-craft dice set to resolve ship vs ship combat and other aspects of the game.&#10;&#10;Core game mechanics include:&#10; - One ship activation per player turn, allows for an engaging game for all players right to the very end.&#10; - Directional wind mechanic to tactically enhance ship movement.&#10; - Ship crew members, with class based abilities and roles.&#10; - Ranged and Melee based combat system though use of D6 outcomes.&#10; - Removable shields attached to the sides of each ship to track damage.&#10; - Modularised ruleset (expansion packs and optional rules can be swapped in/out at the groups discretion).&#10; - Floating loot provides random power-ups, events and penalties.&#10; - Ship movement through on-hand measuring devices for simplicity.&#10; - The paper-craft kits for the game come pre-cut and assembly is glue free.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "This game is a trivia game bearing the name of Myron Cope, former color commentator for the Pittsburgh Steelers.&#10;&#10;The instructions say this game is to be played while watching football, and when &quot;your favorite team&quot; does good things listed in the instructions (touchdown, interception of other team, first down, etc) to spin the spinner and contribute a chip of the color of the region to a kitty. There are 6 regions, 2 of each color red, yellow or blue.  However, on half of the six regions, one for each color, the spinning player is supposed to also take trivia cards, and save them until a commercial break or a penalty in which that player will be asked the questions by the player to his left. For each question the player answers he gets chips from the other players if correct, gives chips if incorrect. The color of the chips exchanged are based on the difficulty of the trivia question, with yellow being the easiest , red in the middle, and blue the hardest. Once the questions are asked, play rotates to the next player to be in charge of the spinner during the next bit of football action. Chips are given and gotten, but no one is ever eliminated, just the balance of chips sways. Player in charge of the spinner when time expires also gets the contents of the kitty being collected through the game.  Chips won from the various rounds of trivia, as well as the kitty are totaled.  The chips yellow, red and blue are worth 1,2,and 3 point respectively.  Player with the most chips is the winner.&#10;&#10;Having heard sports commentators, including Myron, I believe this game is supposed to feel like being a color commentator, where during the football game you do not say much, but then when nothing is happening, the color commentator sweeps in with his trivia, stories, or other banter.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Competitive dice game where vultures fight over a carcass.&#10;&#10;You're a vulture. She's a vulture. Everyone is a vulture -- and everyone is hungry. You are going to fight beak and claw with those other vultures for the sake of first dibs on dinner. But don't get too greedy, or you might wind up with little more than scraps.&#10;&#10;Vulture Culture pits five or more &quot;friends&quot; against each other in a feeding frenzy free-for-all. The game takes place over five rounds, each of which represents the revelation of a fresh carcass to consume. Yummy. The vulture that escapes the scuffle with the fewest feathers ruffled will enjoy the privilege of prime pickings among the tasty treats available. Conversely, the most beat-up buzzards develop an attitude adjustment, which just might earn them the edge next time around.&#10;&#10;Every round, each player receives the same three actions: one each of Attack, Avoid, and Assist. Each round consists of a series of Attacks which take place without a conventional turn order. Attackers choose the strength of their attack, but increasing the strength makes it increasingly likely that the attack will miss its intended target and strike another bird instead. Additionally, every Attack presents an opportunity for all players to Assist with the devious deed at hand, or Avoid taking damage should events go awry. The catch? Every action can be played only once. You can block any one Attack and take no damage, but that leaves you vulnerable for any other actions that occur that round. Success requires roughly equal parts of clever hand management and deft social manipulation.&#10;&#10;Vulture Culture was created to combine the thrill of thematic games like Munchkin and Cosmic Encounter with the mechanically-minded strategic sensibility of eurogames like Power Grid and 7 Wonders, all in less than an hour.&#10;&#10;",

Players may choose from the CCGer, the RPGer, the Eurogamer, the Wargamer or the 18XX-er&#10;&#10;To Win: Survive one-on-one combat until only one player is left.&#10;&#10;Setup: Each player chooses 1 Gamer Gladiator card and places it in front of them and then places a red wooden cube next to the (10) on the Health (HP) Track, located on the left-hand side of the card. Track a gladiator&rsquo;s health up and down this track. If it ever reaches 0 that gladiator is out of the game. Place the six dice in reach of all players.&#10;&#10;Play: 2 players each secretly roll three dice, hiding them from view. Two dice are the Attack dice and the total of both dice is the player&rsquo;s attack strength for this turn. The other is the Special Ability die can be used for a special ability on the Gamer Gladiator card based on the number on the die face (players do not have to use a special ability if they choose not to. In this case set the Special Ability die aside). Players place these dice at the top of their Gamer Gladiator cards in the spaces indicated. Both players then reveal their dice at the same time. Any special abilities chosen are used (if special abilities conflict, players flip a coin for the ability that will happen first), and the player with the higher attack strength wins. The other player reduces their health (HP) by 2 (ex. Bob&rsquo;s attack strength=10, Kylie&rsquo;s attack strength=8, Kylie takes 2HP of damage). In the case of a tie, both players lose 1HP.  If a player rolls their Signature Move with their attack dice, after any special abilities have modified the dice values, they will gain 1HP.&#10;&#10;Play continues in a series of rounds until only one player with health remains. They are then declared &ldquo;Top Gamer&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;Note: For a 3 player game: the youngest player will be the first round&rsquo;s starting player and will choose an opponent. In other rounds, the player who lost last in a round chooses which players will fight in the next round.&#10;&#10;This is the 3rd in a series of Annual Games Unlimited Holiday Games (2013) and is the followup to Gameshop Express (2011) and Gameshop Workday (2012)&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The ink was hardly dry on the documents following the partition of British India in 1947 before war broke out between India and Pakistan. Since the partition, four major wars and numerous smaller conflicts have been waged over much of the same ground. In 1947, 1965, 1971, and 1999 India and Pakistan fought in the mountains of Kashmir and on the plains of the Punjab region to the south.  Today, both sides are armed with thousands of armored vehicles, hundreds of advanced aircraft, and dozens of nuclear weapons.  With tensions high and both sides heavily armed, another conflict may be just a matter of time.&#10;&#10;Next War: India-Pakistan, the next volume in GMT's series of Next War games and a follow-on to&#226;&#128;&#175; Next War: Korea, allows players to fight a near future war between India and Pakistan.&#10;&#10;Due to the nature of a potential conflict, only a portion of the Indo-Pakistani border is featured so that the fighting centers around what it always has: the fate of the Indian state of Jammu &amp; Kashmir. Special rules govern such things as the expanded role bridges play in the region play as well as the fact that both sides in the conflict are nuclear-armed nations. The People's Republic of China and the United States can make an appearance, but they might withdraw in the event of a nuclear exchange. The question is: will this war settle once and for all who will control northwest India?&#10;&#10;Note: the Next War series is not an introductory wargame. Rather, we have intended herein to create a system (and a series) that will allow detailed study of modern warfare in various venues as well as engaging gameplay. That said, the Standard Game rules encompass a fairly straightforward rule set that will, we think, be considered &quot;easy to learn&quot; by experienced wargamers. So, players who choose to play Standard Game scenarios can have a relatively quick game when that's what suits them. The real flavor of a war in the theatre, however, comes through in the Advanced Game, where you get much more control over airpower and can more clearly see each side's strengths and weaknesses. For players who want a &quot;mini-monster game&quot; experience, playing the Advanced Game Campaign Scenarios with some or all of the optional rules will definitely &quot;deliver.&quot;&#10;&#10;Ownership of&#226;&#128;&#175;Next War: Korea&#226;&#128;&#175;will NOT be required to play.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Units&#10;&#10;&#10;Ground units in Next War: India-Pakistan represent the brigades, support units, and divisions of the armies of the India, Pakistan, China, and the United States. All ground units are rated for their attack and defense strengths, movement capabilities, and unit efficiency.&#10;&#10;Air units represent fighter, bomber, and attack squadrons of the major combatants and are rated for All-Weather Capabilities as well as their range, average pilot skill, and their abilities in Air-to-Air Combat, Close Air Support, and Strike missions.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Maps and Terrain&#10;&#10;The game's map represents the area in and around the Punjab district of Pakistan and the Indian state of Jammu &amp; Kashmir at a scale of roughly 7.5 miles per hex. The map stretches from edge of The Great Indian Desert to just inside the Himalayas and encompasses portions of both sides of the border.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Game System&#10;&#10;A game turn is generally composed of:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Weather Determination. Bad weather can severely hamper air operations and can significantly slow ground operations. &#10;     Initiative Determination and Air/Naval Phase, wherein Air Superiority levels and air availability are determined. &#10;     Special Operations Phases&#226;&#128;&#175;in the Advanced Game allowing players to utilize their special operators in various recon and raid missions behind enemy lines. &#10;     Strike Phases&#226;&#128;&#175;in the Advanced Game allowing players to launch air strikes, cruise missiles, artillery and tactical nuclear weapon strikes. &#10;     One or more&#226;&#128;&#175;Movement and Combat Phases&#226;&#128;&#175;that allow both sides to move, react, and fight, with an advantage to the Initiative player on non-Contested turns &#10;     Arrival of Reinforcements and Replacements &#10;     Victory Determination &#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Combat&#10;&#10;Combat&#226;&#128;&#175;resolution examines not only unit strengths but also unit efficiency (representing training, doctrine, and morale), as well as the terrain where the combat takes place. The CRT tends to be very bloody in nature, reflecting what we believe will be a degree of attritional warfare early due to the lethality of modern weapons. As in many games, casualties represent not only actual combat losses but also losses of unit cohesion brought about by the rapid pace with which modern armies are able to engage and exploit on the battlefield.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Nukes&#10;&#10;In this installment, players will have the option, depending on game situation and a die roll to secure release authorization for and use tactical nuclear weapons in the playing area. Use of such weapons, however, could cause your international allies to leave the theater, so be careful!&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Scenarios&#10;&#10;There are several Standard Game scenarios. Some are small and focus on limited objectives while others are variations of a campaign game encompassing the entire map.&#10;&#10;In a break from the standard set in Next War: Korea(and its follow-on Next War: Taiwan), the scenarios in Next War: India-Pakistan posit specific at-start situations and objectives (or victory conditions).  In some scenarios Pakistan is the aggressor while in others the Indian side is on the attack, in all cases there are varying levels of Chinese and United States intervention.&#10;&#10;The International Posture Matrix&#226;&#128;&#175;&agrave; la&#226;&#128;&#175;Flashpoint: Golan &#226;&#128;&#147; The Fifth Arab-Israeli War&#226;&#128;&#175;is still present to allow players to experiment with a variety of intervention options for the US and PRC.&#10;&#10;In &#226;&#128;&#175;Next War: India-Pakistan, Jammu &amp; Kashmir is once again aflame. Can you, as the Islamic Republic of Pakistan's commander, conquer Kashmir and hold it against the enemy? Can you, as the Republic of India's commander, attack and defeat the enemy without the conflict going nuclear? And what will happen in the international community while all this is going on? There&rsquo;s only one way to find out...&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE 3.5 days per turn &#10;MAP SCALE 7.5 miles per hex &#10;UNIT SCALE Brigade / Division / Squadron &#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS: Two (Optimal)&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "A game of robot combat for 2 &ndash; 4 players&#10;&#10;Robot Combat is a game of arena-style robot combat.&#10;&#10;In Robot Combat you randomly pick a combat style robot, which you will maintain, upgrade and fight within the Robot Combat arena. You start with a basic level 1 combat robot and your goal is to improve upon your robot design by upgrading to the strongest level 3 robot and winning the championship. You can do this by winning auctions for new or used robot parts or winning a robot combat match! &#10;You are given a chassis type, an initial drive train, armor, a weapon systems, a motor system, and 12 voltage batteries for each system; everything! During phases of the game you can either bid on new types of Robot Parts for a better deal OR bid on used parts directly from players.&#10;&#10;You begin with a small amount of funds to help you upgrade your robot. When you are ready and your robot is fully functional, you can place your robot on the competition circuit and fight against other robots for prizes or money! In the end there can only be one combat champion robot!&#10;&#10;During combat you will use movement cards to control your robot's drive system within the combat arena to help maneuver your robot into the best fighting position with your weapon. Watch out though, as you move or get knocked around the arena, the combat arena has offensive and defensive weapon systems of its own such as; spikes, ramps, saws, lifters, hammers, etc... these systems try to destroy or inhibit your robot! If your robot becomes immobile, you lose and the match is over!&#10;&#10;The combat arena is a hex style attack grid.&#10;&#10;As you move your robot around the arena you will try to make contact with your opponent which will cause either LIGHT, MEDIUM, OR HEAVY damage.  The damage to your opponent&rsquo;s robot will depend on the level of your weapon or the level of the robot!  Also, when you make contact you can cause different issues with the robots such as; power failure, loss of control, loss of maneuverability, electronic failure, motor failure, battery failure, etc...   These different issues will cause robot part to breakdown.  When a breakdown occurs, you can repair the part or replace it with another part.  Each part has a life span and can only be repaired once, the second time the part breaks down it&rsquo;s destroyed!&#10;&#10;Robot Combat is a turn-based system with rounds and phases. In between matches you will be able to sell or buy new or used parts for your robot to help fix or repair the broken parts before the next match; if you can't fix your robot before the next match, you will have to sit out of the competition until your robot is fully functional.&#10;&#10;Winning each match earns you a trophy and money or parts, if you can upgrade your robot to the highest level and win the most matches; you will earn glory and prestige to become the Robot Combat Champion!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In Antidote, you are a laboratory scientist working for a giant chemical research conglomerate. When a deadly toxin suddenly infects you and everyone in your lab, you must work quickly to share your research and discover the Antidote before it's too late.&#10;&#10;In the game, players take turns deciding what action all other players take: either discard from their hand or trade research with other players. Eventually all your cards will run-out and you will be left with just one that you must &quot;drink&quot; and hope it's the Antidote. If this card is the true Antidote, you're cured and live to play again! If not... you die, but you can always try again!&#10;&#10;Antidote has 6 core elements:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Deduction: Players &quot;live&quot; or &quot;die&quot; by deducing the one card type that has been removed from the game (similar to Clue). &#10;     Semi-Cooperative Gameplay: You live or die alone, but it may be impossible to deduce the Antidote without working with the other players. &#10;     Simultaneous action selection: Every turn involves every player. Whether it is making trades for valuable information or simultaneously declassifying your research, all players are constantly engaged. This makes the game experience more fulfilling and eliminates long-periods of &quot;down-time&quot; between turns.&#10;     Player-controlled game length: Players have sole control over the pace of the game. If you think you know the answer you can speed the game towards its conclusion. If not...well, don't hold your breath! No one is going to wait for you to figure it out! This element adds a feeling of tension and excitement.&#10;     Multiple levels of player interaction: Even a &quot;wink&quot; or a &quot;nod&quot; can have meaning in this game if you are trying to learn or pass information between players. At the same time, a blatant statement such as &quot;Blue formulas are toxic&quot; may have no meaning at all, but everyone will judge you by your actions (everyone can see the cards you choose to discard). &#10;     Surprise ending: It is unlikely that anyone can know with 100% certainty what the Antidote is by the end of the game. This means the revealing of the Antidote is often a surprise.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

They search for treasure which they must take out of the tomb to win, but which slows them down so that the mummies may catch up with them. Each player controls 1 archeologist and 1 mummy.

While the instructions that come with the game offer the rummy-style game mentioned above, trick-taking games, memory games and entirely new games utilizing the multidimensional aspects of the cards are certainly possible with the CLEVER deck.&#10;&#10;",

In round 1, almost any kind of clue is allowed, and the cluegiver cannot pass on a card. In round 2, no more than one word can be used in each clue (but unlimited sounds and gestures are permitted); the cluegiver can pass on any card he likes, and the teammates can give only a single answer. In round 3, the cluegiver can use no words at all and can pass as often as he likes; again, teammates are allowed only a single guess. Give good physical clues in round 1, and they'll pay dividends down the road when you need to keep your mouth shut and gesture like a maniac before time's up!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Kings of Sun Tzu is a 2-4 player competitive game played in rounds centered on situational strategies, resource management, and calculated gambles. Each player is a king of a powerful military state, vying to unite and rule all of China.  Players start each round by rolling dice and placing them on the battlefield. Each player must then puzzle out the best move they can make by evaluating dice positions, resources on the battlefield, and the opponent&rsquo;s goals.  Troops, heroes, tactics, and strategies can all be used to alter the outcome as players try to defeat their opponents and be declared the first emperor of China.&#10;&#10;Kings of Sun Tzu is inspired by the history of China from around 475 BC through 221 BC known as the &ldquo;Warring States&rdquo; period.  The rulers of many powerful states were embroiled in war to determine who would emerge as the conqueror and king of a unified China.  This is the era in which many military innovations occurred in China; the use of iron weapons over bronze and the modernization of armies with mass infantry, crossbowmen, and cavalry.  Around this time, many intellectual developments were also taking place, such as the Hundred Schools of Thought, which included philosophies like Confucianism and Taoism that were being cultivated and spread across the land.  This period also saw the utilization of many great Chinese military classics, including the most celebrated of them all, Sun Tzu&rsquo;s treatise on military strategy, The Art of War.&#10;&#10;",

After determining who goes first, players choose the Robot Master's stage on which they wish to start the game. On your turn, flip over the challenge card to reveal your first challenge. You choose the dice you wish to use to pass the challenge, then play cards from your hand and use abilities from your character to blast, jump or run through the challenge. Your opponents can play cards from the Dr. Wily side of their hand to make your challenge more difficult, possibly doing damage or taking lives from you along the way. If you beat the challenge, you move forward on the stage a number of spaces determined by the challenge you defeated.&#10;&#10;Once all spaces are clear and you are face-to-face with the Robot Master, you enter the &quot;Boss Battle&quot;. You and your opponents now take turns battling each other until only one robot remains standing. If you are the victor, you take the Robot Master's powers from the character card, stacking it under your own character card. If you were the first player to defeat this Robot Master, you also gain its Trophy, which allows you to set a die to any face you wish in a future Challenge or Boss Battle.&#10;&#10;Play continues around the board until you have defeated enough Robot Masters to enter Dr. Wily's castle and face the final boss. The first player to defeat Dr. Wily wins.&#10;&#10;",

Turn over a second card and lay it next to the first. On the second card, look at the object in the white circle. What colour is this object on the first card? The game continues with the second card serving as the first card, and a new card is turned over from the draw pile.&#10;&#10;The end of play: the game ends when the draw pile is empty.

Your job as urban planners is to strike a balance between serving diverse public interests, and managing ten-story tall monsters who are committed to leaving their marks on Monster City.&#10;&#10;Monster City Planners is a deeply strategic game with drafting, dual use cards, and hidden goal selection. Players start each round by choosing their hand of cards through a draft. Each card has two uses: 1) a monster action that changes the city plan, and 2) a unique scoring criteria for earning points. But you can only use each card for one of its two purposes. After the draft, players take turns constructing and demolishing buildings until both players yield. They then score points based on the unused cards that remain in their hand, and how well those cards' scoring criteria are reflected in the final city plan.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Cuba: The Splendid Little War, from designer Javier Garcia de Gabiola, is a two-player simulation of the third War of Cuban Independence, which lasted from 1895 to 1898. (This was the last of the three liberation wars fought between Cuba and Spain; the previous wars were the Ten Years' War (1868-1878) and the Little War (1879-1880). One player controls the forces of the Spanish colonial government, fighting to retain Cuba; the other player controls the Cuban rebels fighting for their independence.&#10;&#10;Gameplay represents the main insurgency and counterinsurgency operations that took place, and players must make key strategic decisions to achieve their objectives while balancing their resources and preventing their opponent from doing the same.&#10;&#10;There are event cards that help and hinder both players; disease, ambushes, assassinations, and the reactions of the American press and government. Steamships, railroads, telegraphs were all common, but there were no radios, almost no automobiles, and no airplanes, just like in the U.S.. Newspapers and magazines were the cutting edge of media, so print was &ldquo;king.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;As the Spanish, can you maintain control of the island, keep the economy going, and keep the U.S. claws out of the island? Or, as the Cubans, can you take control of the island, and stand your independence over the U.S. annexionist plans?

Whoever lands three ships on the sandy shores of Victor Island first, is declared winner, and is rewarded the platinum-power-paddle. The coins act as currency in a blind-bidding and bluffing round, in which the movement of your ships is determined. However, these coins also act as ships. Therefore, placing ships on the board drains your bidding resources.&#10;&#10;Tactics, wits and some winds of fate will carry the winner to Victor Island.&#10;&#10;",

You have 2 early decisions to make, then sit back and watch the round unfold. Each round has 1 winner and 1 loser.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with 3 Heart Tiles, 2 QJP Tiles and 1 Joker Tile. Each player gets dealt 2 cards (as in poker).&#10;&#10;The first choice is do you use a QJP tile? This will change 1 or both of your starting cards. You can then choose to use your Joker. If you play your Joker and you end the round with the best hand you win an extra Heart Tile. If you have the worst hand, then you don't lose a heart tile.&#10;&#10;The hand then plays out, as it would in poker, however, hands  are all revealed so everybody can see what people have. There is no gambling. You all see how everybody gets on. Then the player with the worst hand, loses a heart. If you lose all your hearts then you are out. Last player standing wins.&#10;&#10;Although the game uses a poker mechanic, it differs as all players show their hand, so there is no gambling. It turns it into a co-operative game style with lots of players hoping one will do badly. It also differs from poker with the use of the QJP, Joker and Heart based structure, which are tokens/tiles and not gambling chips.&#10;&#10;",

The winner of the trick assigns the face-down card to either the &lsquo;Target&rsquo;, herself, or, if the winner of the trick is the Target then to any player she chooses. Once a certain number of cards have been assigned the game ends, and the face-down cards assigned to each player are resolved.

Correct answers are scored on a bingo type of scorecard.&#10;&#10;Object of the game (quoted from the game rules):&#10;&quot;To win, a player must answer enough questions to complete a straight line of Bafflewinks across the Baffleboard in any direction -- horizontal, vertical or diagonal.&quot;&#10;&#10;Each Bafflecard lists 5 numbered questions all of the same subject, with the correct answers given on the reverse side of the card. A numbered question is determined by flicking the spinner, and the player answers that question from the top card on the draw pile.&#10;&#10;When a correct answer is given, the player places a Bafflewink on the same number in the column under its subject heading on his Baffleboard. If there is a Bafflewink already on that spot, the player must answer a question from the next card, otherwise play passes to the next player on the left.&#10;&#10;A Baffleboard is basically a 5x5 bingo card, but only the player who answered the question correctly places a Bafflewink on his Baffleboard.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;20 different Baffleboards&#10;200 different Bafflecards- 40 each in one of 5 subjects&#10;105 Bafflewinks (small red transparent discs)&#10;1 spinner&#10;1 set of rules&#10;&#10;Bible Bafflers, Jr. may be played along with the original Bible Bafflers game. It is suggested that the younger players answer questions from the Bible Bafflers, Jr. cards, and the older players answer questions from the original game.&#10;&#10;Team play is allowed.&#10;&#10;Tenwinks is a variant for 2 experienced players. Each player plays with only 10 Bafflewinks. If a player answers a question correctly but all 10 Bafflewinks are already on the player's Baffleboard, then one of those Bafflewinks must be moved to the spot corresponding to the current correct answer.&#10;&#10;The game was published in 1984 by Paraclete Press.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "This is the earliest of a range of Japanese card games based on Portuguese playing cards brought to Japan in the mid 16th century. All these games as well as some unrelated and more recent games are denoted by the word &quot;karuta&quot; from Portuguese &quot;carta&quot;. Due to the age of this loanword, it can be written in a bewildering number of ways. About equally frequent are &#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#159; in hiragana as other old loans that have been naturalised and &#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#191; in katakana, like modern loanwords. Archaic and more rarely seen are &quot;sound-ateji forms&quot; like &#230;&#173;&#140;&#231;&#149;&#153;&#229;&#164;&#154;, &#229;&#138;&#160;&#231;&#149;&#153;&#229;&#164;&#154; or &#229;&#152;&#137;&#231;&#149;&#153;&#229;&#164;&#170; using kanji for their sound value without reference to their meanings. The kanji &#233;&#170;&#168;&#231;&#137;&#140; might be read karuta, but primarily represents koppai &#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#132;, meaning a particular type of cards, or &quot;bone mahjong tiles&quot; (from Chinese g&#199;&#148; p&aacute;i meaning &quot;bone tile&quot;, referring to dominoes). Besides this, the term fuda &#227;&#129;&#181;&#227;&#129;&#160; might be used for at least some forms of playing cards. This may also be written with the kanji &#230;&#156;&#173; with the primary meaning &quot;paper money&quot;, and in this sense read satsu &#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#164;.&#10;&#10;The term &quot;Tensh&#197;&#141; karuta&quot; is a later term later applied to distinguish the oldest form (which in origin actually predates the Tensh&#197;&#141; period) from later developments.&#10;&#10;The 48-card deck is divided into the four suits of pau &#227;&#129;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#134; &ndash; from paus &quot;clubs&quot;, isu &#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#153; &ndash; from espadas &quot;swords&quot; (shortened), koppu &#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#183; &ndash; from copas &quot;cups&quot; and &#197;&#141;ru &#227;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#139; &ndash; from ouros &quot;coins&quot; (literally the plural of &quot;gold&quot;). Each suit consists of 12 cards: rei &#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#132; &ndash; from rei &quot;king&quot;, kaba &#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#176; &ndash; from cavaleiro &quot;knight&quot; or cavalo &quot;horse&quot; (shortened), s&#197;&#141;ta &#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#159; &ndash; from sota &quot;servant&quot; literally &quot;lower [rank]&quot; and number cards from ace to nine. As in the Portuguese precursor, the ace cards depicts a dragon holding the suit symbol. In the &quot;short&quot; suits of cups and coins the number cards rank in reverse from ace (high) to nine (low), while the &quot;long&quot; suits of clubs and swords are ranked normally. This feature is not only shared with older European cards, but at least for coins goes all the way back to the earliest Chinese playing cards.&#10;&#10;Later some of the Portuguese-derived names are replaced by indigenous ones. Pau becomes hau &#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#134;, &quot;flower&quot;, and the clubs are shown sprouting flowers; while kaba becomes uma &#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#190; &quot;horse&quot;.&#10;&#10;Unsun karuta and Sunkun karuta are rooted in Tensh&#197;&#141; karuta&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Venture deep into the hidden, subterranean passages of Tutankhamen's tomb to locate the four temples devoted to the deities that protect the pharaoh in the Netherworld. Upon entering each of the four temples, the player must defeat the Temple Guardian and return the funerary jars to the King's Treasury &mdash; all before Khepri raises the new sun.&#10;&#10;Carter's Quest is solitaire tile-laying adventure game set in the 1920s. Portraying the world-famous archaeologist Howard Carter, the player lays tiles beginning at the King's Treasury and must find the four funerary jars and return them to the Treasury before the sun rises. Along the way, the player will collect weapons and provisions to help defend himself from the wrath of the deadly, sometimes poisonous, creatures inhabiting Tutankhamen's tomb. Find the jars, return them to the Treasury and save the world. Otherwise, you're devoured by the Pharaoh's curse.&#10;&#10;Carter's Quest is a variant of Zombie in my Pocket, but this game employs a unique, dice-rolling combat system in which the items a player finds are used to modify the combat roll. Players are also at risk of being poisoned by some of the creatures in the game and will need to find the antidote or rest in the Priest's Temple; otherwise they will be consumed by the toxins and lose the game.&#10;&#10;",

'Pirates!' is played with an unique combination of cards, dice and tokens where players must seize glory as they sail the seven seas. However, unlike a game where you&rsquo;re already established as a villain, 'Pirates!' starts with the barest of set-ups then sees you actually progress. Upgrading your ship and conquering new ships is the order of the day as you take down merchants and other pirates aplenty to build up your own fleet. Will you be feared and become the new Blackbeard, or thrown over board to feed the sharks by your conqueror?&#10;&#10;In the game there is a wide variation of ships which have a different combinations of speed, cannons, crew members and cargo. Pirate cards can be used in your turn or during battle, improving your ship or giving an advantage in battles.&#10; The goal of the game is to become the master of the oceans by conquering 7 pirate points (golden skulls). Ships are worth 1 or 2 pirate points, but pirate points are also found on adventures and fame cards. The game will also end when you conquer all your opponents ships.&#10;&#10;",

They have been kicked off the ship by their captain in Walk the Plank and chased by sharks in Get Bit, and now they face their final challenge.&#10;&#10;In Hold Your Breath! each player assumes the role of a pirate treading water in the ocean. These brilliant tacticians have decided to play a game of &quot;Hold Your Breath&quot; to see who is the toughest pirate because, you know, what else are you gonna do in the middle of the ocean facing certain death?&#10;&#10;The game is played in two rounds. In the first round, each player may dive deeper, providing they have the &quot;Swim&quot; and &quot;Air&quot; cards to do so. Players press their luck each turn since it is the pirate who dives the deepest in round one AND resurfaces in round two who is the winner. What about the losers? Who cares, they are losers. But if you really want to know, well, they dove down and ran out of oxygen before they could resurface, so now they are just &quot;resting&quot; underwater until the next game, okay? But we digress...&#10;&#10;Players can play &quot;Panic&quot;, &quot;Shark&quot;, and other nasty cards on the other players, slowing their progress. In the second round each player struggles to reach the surface before he runs out of air and therefore decides to take a rest. Most of the pirates may not make it back to the surface, but the one who makes it back alive AND dove the deepest is the winner. Be careful, though, because if you dove the deepest in the first round, you will surely have the toughest time getting back to the surface since A) you swam the deepest and B) no one else wants to see you make it back alive.&#10;&#10;",

If there are no pairs, then the player scores 0 points for that round. If the player voluntarily stops, then he scores points for the pairs and minus 1 for each unused die. When someone gets 100 points, each other player has one turn. The highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The third in the Lords of War: Fantasy Battles series from Black Box Games, Lords of War: Templars versus Undead is a dual-deck strategic card game for two-plus players. Like its award-winning predecessors Lords of War: Orcs versus Dwarves and Lords of War: Elves versus Lizardmen, the game sees fantasy races engage in dynamic tactical card battles, with the armies in this set having more heavy defense and the series&rsquo; first moving units.&#10;&#10;During Lords of War battles, players use hands of six cards (called units) drawn from their army deck of 36 cards. A player turn starts with one card placed onto a gridded board. With the exception of ranged and spear units, cards must be placed adjacent to an enemy unit. An elimination phase follows in which you check for the elimination of opposing cards and the one you just placed. Cards have unique formations of attack arrows on their edges and corners signifying which adjacent cards they attack once played and the damage they will do. Each card also has a defense value which when exceeded by opposing cards sees that card defeated. Once combat has been resolved, the player can then either draw a new card from his army deck or retrieve a unit from the board that has not engaged in combat during that turn.&#10;&#10;Play continues until one player has eliminated twenty units or four commanders.&#10;&#10;The game is playable out of the box and contains two complete armies: the Templars and the Undead. These factions are differentiated by their unique cards and strategies; the Templar faction is based around a heavily armoured infantry and mobile palisades. The Undead army contains a stark range of defensive and offensive units, including zombies which roam across the battlefield.&#10;&#10;Templars versus Undead is compatible with both Elves versus Lizardmen and Orcs versus Dwarves, meaning that all the Lords of War armies can be used to battle one another. The armies can also be blended together, using a strict ranking system, to create mercenary decks for tournament play.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Shadows of Brimstone: Swamps of Death is a fast-paced, fully cooperative, dungeon-crawl board game set in the Old West, with a heavy dose of unspeakable horror! Players create characters, taking on the role of a classic Western Hero Archetype, such as the Law Man, Gunslinger, or Saloon Girl. Forming an adventuring posse, the Heroes venture down into the dark mines, overrun with all manner of ancient demons and foul creatures from another world. With tactical gameplay, lots of dice, and a robust card-driven exploration system, no two games are ever the same as the heroes explore the mines finding new enemies to fight, new loot to collect, and new dangers to overcome. Players can even find portals to other worlds, stepping through to continue their adventures on the other side!&#10;&#10;An exciting campaign system allows the players to visit local frontier towns between adventures, spending their hard-earned loot and building their characters from game to game! As players find fantastic gear and artifacts to equip their heroes, they also gain experience from their adventures. This experience is used to level up, guiding the hero's path through an expansive, class-specific upgrade tree of new skills and abilities, allowing each player to develop their hero to fit their own play style.&#10;&#10;In Swamps of Death, players will encounter portals to the otherworld Jargono, a humid swampland inhabited by sentient reptiles, vicious dinosaurs and a tribe of humanoids, cut off from return to their homeworld untold years after their own portal closed.&#10;&#10;So load up yer' six shooter, throw on yer' hat and poncho, and gather the posse as the darkness is coming, and all hell's about to break loose...in the Shadows of Brimstone!&#10;&#10;Can be used together with Shadows of Brimstone: City of the Ancients to raise the maximum players to 6.&#10;&#10;",

And yet very usable and very practical cards &ndash; it can be used either as The Tarot of Loka game, or as traditional Tarot, or as a set of normal playing cards.&#10;&#10;The game is played in two teams of two players, sitting around  table in alternating positions (as in bridge, for example...).&#10;&#10;Two new cards have been added to the deck to make the deck unique and different from other trick-taking games.&#10;&#10;In the basic rules, there is no following suit and the two extra cards have very simple rules. In the advanced rules, there is a following suit rule and the two cards play a much heavier effect on play, identifying one team as good and one as evil, thus associating that team with the two 'evil' suits and vice versa.&#10;&#10;The players take tricks, winning them by playing a higher card of the led suit or by playing the highest trump (i.e. a major arcana). At the end of the game the cards taken by winning the tricks are added up (face cards, aces and some major arcana are worth more points).&#10;&#10;",
