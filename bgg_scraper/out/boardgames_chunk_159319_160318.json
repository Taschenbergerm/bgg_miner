There is a single deck of cards, no other play components. Advanced players may add custom cards.&#10;&#10;The main mechanics are: shuffled cards, card drawing, turns, card playing, abilities (whose rules are applied when cards are played), and combo actions (= combining the abilities of multiple cards played in a single turn).&#10;&#10;The system's logic is based on the diversity of the (rules of the) abilities present on the cards, and has an emphasis on combo actions. Combo actions emerge fluidly from the abilities, and have to be created on the spot by the players. To master the game, a player has to master combo actions.&#10;&#10;The typical game duration for veteran players, without advanced gameplay, is (consistently) 30 minutes. Beginner players (who already know the rules) need about 60 minutes.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Gameplay Synopsis&#10;&#10;Most of the time, a player has to engage (= play from hand) during his / her turns cards whose total sway (= numeric card value) is at least equal with the total sway of the cards engaged by the rival, thusly obstructing the rival.&#10;&#10;Normally, during a turn, a player may engage only 1 card, but the abilities of the engaged cards allow for more cards to be engaged or drawn. This multiple engagement of cards is called combo action and forms the game's logic. Combo actions with 10 cards are not rare, and even with more than 20 have been seen.&#10;&#10;From time to time, a player will not be able to obstruct the rival because he / she will not be able to create combos that are strong enough. In such a case, the player must discard 1 card from his / her reserve. Reserve is a play zone of each player, zone which contains a number of cards which is fixed at the beginning of the game; the number is normally 3, but advanced players can increase it by recruiting (= choosing) cards at the beginning of the game.&#10;&#10;By discarding a reserve card each time when a player can't obstruct the rival, the player will have fewer cards to engage during the last turn of the game, the turn which will determine the winner of the game. However, simply having more or fewer cards in the reserve at the end of the game doesn't guarantee winning or losing the game, it just increases or decreases the chances. This is because each player also has some random cards in his / her hand, and this randomness affects the ending.&#10;&#10;",

If he lands on a property owned by another player, he must pay that player rent according to the value of the land and any buildings on it.

        "description": "The rules of the game, for example, start out with this explanation: &ldquo;Unlike other board games, nobody really wins at Administration. During the game each player gets poorer as, little by little, all money and property pass into the hands of the Administration. Thus the game is much like real life.&#10;&#10;The object is to remain &ldquo;financially solvent&rdquo; if possible and the winner is the player who is still able to pay of his debts at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;As one plops around the board, after a throw of the dice, he is able to pick up certain pieces of property.&#10;&#10;These include such holdings as &ldquo;The Managed News Service&rdquo;, the &ldquo;Re-run TV Network,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Feather bedded Railroad&rdquo;, the &ldquo;Lemon Auto Co.,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Rusty Steel Co.,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Big Brother Power Co.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;HOWEVER, THERE ARE other blocks to land on and some of these carry rather snide directions such as:&#10;&ldquo;Collect $2,000 for information on fellow taxpayer.&rdquo;&#10;Or, &ldquo;Election time; Administration exacts your contribution. Pay $3,000.&rdquo;&#10;Or, &ldquo;You are remanded to public psychiatric hearing for remark critical to the administration; lose one turn.&rdquo;&#10;Or, &ldquo;You get free Medicare but each other player pays tax of $1,500.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Apparently, the game can get quite complicated. Quoting again from the rules: &ldquo;When a player lands on another player&rsquo;s privately owned property, rent shown on the deed is paid as follows:&#10;1. The landing player pays rent to the property owner.&#10;2. The property owner is taxed half of his rent by the Administration, except that unions are exempt from this tax.&#10;3. If the property has a union, and if the union is owned, the property owner pays half of his remaining rent to the owner of the union.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Still another aspect of the games comes in the collection of cards the player must draw from time to time.&#10;&#10;These are broken down into three groups, &ldquo;Planning, Court Rulings and Favoritism.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;The Planning cards include such directions as:&#10;&ldquo;Share the wealth. Give $5,000 to the player who has the least cash.&rdquo;&#10;&ldquo;Administration announces a new welfare program. You get something for nothing. A new tax. Pay $5,000&Prime;.&#10;&ldquo;By extensive correspondence, you refute Administration claim that you owe $600 in back taxes. Pay $500 postage.&rdquo;&#10;&ldquo;Administrative planning staff hires malcontent leftist professors recently employed by the university. Pay $2,000 staff salaries.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;&ldquo;COURT RULINGS&rdquo; cards include these notices:&#10;&ldquo;You win case but must pay $1,000 to Administration for court record.&rdquo;&#10;&ldquo;You lose case and are charged $3,000 for contempt of court.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;FAVORITISM&rdquo; cards run like this:&#10;&ldquo;Rusty Steel Co. gets order from Communist for 190 million shovels. Administration subsidizes sale. If you own the company, collect $5,000 from the Administration.&rdquo;&#10;&ldquo;Administration gives you $9,000 for concocting an October crises for the next election.&rdquo;&#10;&ldquo;Collect $3,000 for not raising cotton.&rdquo;&#10;&ldquo;As a relative of the chief administrator, you get cheap oil lease from Administration, which you sell back at a profit. Collect $4,000.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;According to the message on the box the game comes in, Administration is &ldquo;simple enough for children&rdquo; and &ldquo;delightful for adults.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;",

Combine cards, launch devastating attacks, and defend against a barrage of creativity!&#10;&#10;In Ultimate Battle, the goal is to utterly destroy your opponent. In this creativity-fueled game it's one-hit destruction, so players must plan attacks and defenses carefully.&#10;&#10;The gameplay centers around two to four players each drawing from a deck of Ultimate Battle Cards. These fully illustrated cards contain everything from powerful weapons and creatures (like sharks and poison) to more mundane objects (like a brick). Using their imaginations, players must illustrate attacks against their opponents on a large sheet of paper rolled out between both players. The attacking player uses any combination of cards in their hand to launch their attack. The defending player must then use cards from their hand to defend.&#10;&#10;If players disagree on whether an attack or defense is valid a Disagreement Card is drawn, which quickly resolves any qualms. This gets the group back to playing as quickly as possible.&#10;&#10;If a player can't defend an attack, or loses a disagreement when trying to defend, he or she is destroyed! Whether a world-class artist or a stick-figure impresario, everyone can draw out wild attacks in Ultimate Battle. Think quick, sketch even quicker, and may the best battler win!&#10;&#10;",

At the start of a round, shuffle the cards, place one in the center of the table, then distribute the rest of the cards to the players. On a turn, a player asks one of two types of questions of another player: &quot;How many cards do you hold of a certain number?&quot; or &quot;What's the sum of the spring (summer, etc.) cards that you hold?&quot; In the latter case, as a cost you must place  one card from your hand on display, revealing information to all players.&#10;&#10;When you think you know which card is in the middle of the table, take a peek; if you're correct, you score points and the game ends as soon as someone has collected six points.&#10;&#10;",

On two opposite sides of the board is a black border numbered one through five, then skipping two spaces, and numbered five through one.  A similar red numbered border exists on the board's other sides.&#10;&#10;The game is played with up to six pieces for each player in red, blue, yellow, or green.  The object is for a player to start the game with their pieces in the opposite corner of the home area of their color, and to move at least three of their pieces into that home area before their opponents, to win the game.&#10;&#10;Movement of pieces is determined by one red and one black six-sided die; a piece will be moved to the spot where these two coordinates meet.  There then follows a series of rules governing the exact part of the board the piece can move to, and what goals must be met for the piece to move further, and what happens when pieces become &quot;triangulated,&quot; or captured.&#10;&#10;Notes: The rules are detailed but something less than clear on some important details.  Also, like other games from this publisher, the game board is a printed sheet of paper held between a transparent sheet of plastic in a black plastic frame.&#10;&#10;",

The sheep must continue placing his marbles one at a time anywhere on the board until they have all been placed.  At that point, the sheep marbles can move the same as the wolf.&#10;&#10;The wolf can capture any sheep in an adjacent hole by jumping over it to a vacant hole on its opposite side and removing it from play.  Multiple jumps are possible.  The sheep cannot capture but must try to crowd the wolf so that it cannot move, either with white marbles or against the edge of the board.  If the sheep trap the wolf, they win.  If the wolf can no longer be trapped, he wins.&#10;&#10;This is a variant of Fox and Geese.&#10;&#10;",

Gather a few friends &rsquo;round the table and see how quickly all those years of bonding and camaraderie can be ripped to shreds with a well placed hex. Strategically protect your own good fortunes (Wealth, Health, Love, Fate, and Luck) while devastating the fortunes of those around you.&#10;&#10;Each player in Cursed! is dealt a hand of three cards (blessings, curses, or neutrals each in one of five fortunes) and must choose to play one card on herself, one card on an opponent, and sacrifice one card to make a slight alteration to the rules of the game. When a player accumulates curses on three or more fortunes, he is out of the game (play continues until one player is left). If he accumulates blessings on three or more fortunes, he wins.&#10;&#10;The game consists of 104 poker-sized cards in a tuck box and an optional player mat. There is also a print-and-play version.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Prime Climb is a new board game that uses arithmetic to open a beautiful world of possibility. Players race to be the first to get to the center of the board while avoiding getting knocked back to the start by other players. Highlighting the power of the prime numbers, Prime Climb is mathematical, deep, creative, and fun.&#10;&#10;Each player controls two pawns that start at the 0 circle. Players take turns rolling two 10-sided dice and applying the values to their two pawns using any of the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The first to get both pawns into the 101 circle exactly wins the game! Be careful: if another player lands on you, you get sent back to the start. Along the way, players who land on the red circles collect Prime cards&mdash;some are helpful now, some are helpful later, and a few are trouble!&#10;&#10;One of the great innovations of Prime Climb is the coloring scheme. Each of the prime numbers less than 10 has its own color: 2 is orange, 3 is green, 5 is blue, and 7 is purple. After 10, each prime number is red. Any number that is not a prime is a mix of colors that corresponds to its prime factors. For example, 14 = 2 x 7, so the 14 circle is half orange and half purple.&#10;&#10;The color coding allows players a way to quickly analyze the factors and multiples of the numbers on the board. This helps players check their multiplication and division, and even allows kids who haven't yet learned multiplication to play the game.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Medieval Battle is a model battle game, with two players each commanding an army of knights. Players start by building a battlefield, recruiting knights to their army, then deploying them. Players act in turn to maneuver their knights on the battlefield, and the combat potential for each type of troop differs, with heavy armored units moving more slowly and fighting better than lighter units. Pikemen can stop cavalry, while archers and longbowmen want to keep enemy units below them and light cavalry are ideal for chasing archers on horseback. The unique system of combat results has no randomness.&#10;&#10;Players look for advantages and opportunities, attacking the enemy when it's too tired to run, for example, or claiming good terrain position. By using the power and mobility of his forces, a player tries to control more strategic points than his opponent and thereby win the game.&#10;&#10;",

A score pad is also provided.&#10;&#10;On each turn a player rolls the dice and removes pegs based on the outcome, then tries to remove as many more pegs as possible by jumping as in Checkers or Solitaire puzzles.  When no more moves are possible, the score is tallied exactly as in real bowling games.  A second roll of the dice is then allowed, to attempt to remove any pegs remaining.  The next player then resets the pegs and takes his turn.&#10;&#10;Rolling a double on the first dice throw is a strike, rolling a double on the second throw is a spare.  Players track their scores in a regular bowling score format, with the winner being the player scoring the highest number of points in ten frames.&#10;&#10;",

Varying card backs allow for vastly improved strategic planning - knowing what card type is coming up next allows you and your fellow Agents to make more informed decisions.&#10;&#10;Players are free to move around the board and tackle challenges however they see fit, but a lack of co-ordination will allow the darkness to creep over the city, and the Cataclysm to be at its strongest.&#10;&#10;The Agents&#10;Players take on the role of an Agent. Play as the media-savvy Shadow, the noble Knight Templar, the mysterious Watcher, or the enigmatic Outsider, and employ your unique gifts to aid your fellow Agents.&#10;&#10;The Cataclysm&#10;The goal in The Shadow Over Westminster is to save the city (and the world) from the oncoming Cataclysm. At the start, the Agents don't know what the Cataclysm could be, only that it's coming - but as the game progresses, the team can use their research, investigation, and special talents to uncover what doom approaches.&#10;&#10;The Cataclysm is chosen randomly at the start of the game and placed face down until the Agents have done enough research and investigation to uncover the threat. Uncovering the Cataclysm is only half the battle - once uncovered, the Agents must overcome the Cataclysm's unique effect and drive the evil back out of this world, using the research, investigation, artifact, and talisman cards they've collected throughout the game.&#10;&#10;With over a dozen cataclysms, who knows what the more malicious denizens of London are up to in the shadows.&#10;&#10;Scales for 1-4 players to enjoy in 60-90 minutes.&#10;&#10;",

Your team of test subjects has entered the Lab and is ready to perform all sorts of important, dignified, and dangerous testing procedures...all in the pursuit of cake! It's a fun and funny fast-paced fight to the finish &mdash; and by finish, we mean your team probably died.&#10;&#10;The Lab is an ever-changing conveyor belt of death and dismemberment. But SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS must be at the forefront of the mind of every good test subject. In Portal: The Uncooperative Cake Acquisition Game, a game of constantly shifting area control and cardplay by the creators of the Portal and Portal 2 video games, players move and Portal their test subjects to various chambers in the lab. At the end of each player's turn, one of the chambers on the end of the lab gives way, plunging all test subjects on it into oblivion. But should your test subjects have numbered greater than all others in the falling chamber, they earn you some wonderful parting gifts, which can include cake.&#10;&#10;Yet these moist slices of industrial-grade cake must be stored in the lab where they are at risk of falling into said oblivion. Not to mention that your jealous opponents can pick up your cake and move it closer to that precipice. He who has acquired the most cake when a team has lost its last test subject wins. Do you risk gathering cake early for a quick win? Or do you bide your time and wait until you can protect it better? Win the game and prove the cake was no lie.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;    1 Manual&#10;    1 Resource Board&#10;    18 Test Chamber Panels&#10;    20 Aperture Cards/Characters&#10;    4 Oversized Portal Gun Cards&#10;    1 Turret Miniature&#10;    1 Companion Cube Miniature&#10;    2 Portal Tokens&#10;    1 GLaDOS Token&#10;    32 Test Subject Miniatures&#10;    32 Cake Slice Miniatures&#10;    1 Free Portal 2 Steam Activation Code&#10;&#10;",

There is no board; instead, the hexes form a constantly shifting maze of possible moves, blocks, and scoring opportunities.&#10;&#10;Each player places tiles and attempts to favorably arrange the hexes to complete their goal cards and thwart their opponent&rsquo;s plans.&#10;&#10;It only takes a few minutes to learn, but a lifetime to master.&#10;&#10;The core game is a 2-player head-to-head but rules variants allow for 3-player or solo play.&#10;&#10;",

The game is played in rounds, with scores being based on the letters played at the end of each round.&#10;&#10;This sounds simple, but beware of the Alpha Bandits! These sneaky tiles allow players to block, swap, flip, grab, or even end the round early for the win!&#10;&#10;Each game also contains a few rare &quot;Gemstone&quot; tiles that are worth extra points and may be used as any letter in the alphabet, making them very valuable indeed!&#10;&#10;",

In the two player game, each player controls two colors and must move both of their Lion and Mouse pieces to the appropriate dens.&#10;&#10;Each piece has unique traits: the Hunter can &quot;trap&quot; (lock down) a Mouse or send a Lion back to its Start space; the Mouse can free a Lion from a trap; the Lion can send a Hunter back to its start space from outside a trap space. The spinner determines which piece may move, though some spinner spaces permit the player to choose.&#10;&#10;",

Players take turns in order moving the allotted number of spaces (dice roll) in a clockwise direction around the board. If a player lands on a property with special instructions, they must be followed. If the player lands on an unowned property, it may be purchased. If the player lands on a property owned by another player, then rent must be collected. If the player lands on a property they already own, that player than receives rent from the bank. If a player rolls doubles, they roll again. A second roll of doubles send that player to the Roundhouse.&#10;&#10;A player may sell any properties they own to any other player at any time during the game. The bank is forces to buy back any property a player choose at 67% of the original cost. The rent of each property is 10% of its original cost. If a players owns two properties of a kind (for example the Art Museum and the Academy of Music - cultural institutions) the rent is doubled. If a player owns three properties the rent is tripled. A player may not collect any rents while his pawn is at the Roundhouse or on the Expressway.&#10;&#10;Whenever a player rolls a &quot;one&quot; that player gets to draw a Travel card. Whenever a player rolls a &quot;six&quot; that player gets to draw a News card. If a player rolls both a &quot;one&quot; and a &quot;six&quot; on the same roll that player can select either type of card, but not both. If double &quot;ones&quot; or &quot;sixes&quot; are rolled, that player draws nothing. When a player ends their turn on a block marked &quot;Travel Card&quot; or &quot;News Card&quot; that player draws the appropriate card. A player that ends their turn on either the Free Library or Franklin Institute gets to answer a Quiz card drawn by the player on their left. The &quot;correct&quot; answers to the Quiz cards are left to the discretion of the game players.&#10;&#10;",

The Monarch (Sheriff) may get an additional skill related to their kingdom allegiance; players routinely have two powers.&#10;2. Weapons may have their own additional powers.&#10;3. A card to let a player borrow a weapon from another.&#10;4. A card to cancel the effect of other cards.&#10;5. Peach (Beer) may be played by any player when someone loses their last life; there is no exemption of using Peach when there are only 2 players left.&#10;6.

The red spurt cards allow the car to advance from a space with a yellow arrow to the next space with a red tableau. The green attack cards allow a car to exchange it's positon with any one opponent on the throw of an even number.

It contains the base game plus all official expansions (Battle, Wind, Fire, Woods and Mountain).&#10;&#10;In the 2011 Guan Yu Stamp edition, two characters were changed:&#10;&#10;Zhou Yu (WU, from base game): the second ability now gives out the card before the damage is dealt.&#10;&#10;Zhu Rong (SHU, from Fire exp.): the second ability allows a point duel only with the direct victim of her Strike (not with shackled players).&#10;&#10;&#10;Legends of the Three Kingdoms (a.k.a. San Guo Sha) is a card game based off the Chinese classical novel, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which shares many rules with Bang!, the differences are as follows:&#10;1. The Monarch (Sheriff) may get an additional skill related to their kingdom allegiance; players routinely have two powers.&#10;2. Weapons may have their own additional powers.&#10;3. A card to let a player borrow a weapon from another.&#10;4. A card to cancel the effect of other cards.&#10;5. Peach (Beer) may be played by any player when someone loses their last life; there is no exemption of using Peach when there are only 2 players left.&#10;6. The game proceeds counter-clockwise.&#10;&#10;",

But if they land on a foreign transmitter space, they must exclaim &quot;I have committed a criminal offense&quot;, pay a pfennig into the pot and go back to start. Worst is if they land on London's transmitter, when they must shout &quot;God punish England!&quot; and pay 5 pfennig into the pot as well as start over. The pot is taken by the winner.&#10;&#10;The title &quot;Radio-Sende-Spiel&quot; translates in Google Translate to &quot;Radio Broadcast Game&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

The board is divided into three 3x3 sections, with each player claiming one side and the central territory in dispute.  Three each of a player's &quot;spots&quot; are marked with either the number one, two, or three.  The game begins with the three spots in the row closest to the players, the two spots in the next row inward, and the one spots in the next row.&#10;&#10;Players take turns moving one piece at a time and try to claim the central area or prevent their opponent from doing so.  All spots move only forward.  One spots move one square diagonally.  Two spots move two squares directly forward.  Three spots move either two squares forward and one square sideways, or one square sideways and two squares forward.&#10;&#10;Capture of pieces is by displacement and there are a number of rules governing it.  To win the game, a player must occupy five squares of the central area, or block his opponent from moving, or reduce his opponent to less than five pieces.&#10;&#10;",

Players begin placing their tiles on the board, attempting to make &quot;sequences&quot; of colors.  The rules provide for a number of these, including a rainbow sequence, a hot spectrum sequence, a cold spectrum sequence, and more.  These sequences incorporate the existing colors of the board and are governed by still more rules.&#10;&#10;Different levels of points are scored for each sequence as players complete their turns.

Gameplay loosely resembles poker, while hand scoring resembles blackjack. Players are dealt an initial hand, then can draw more cards to their hand, while wagering over the value of hands. Wagers are paid into two pots, a Hand Pot and a Sabacc Pot. Once the hand has been called, players reveal their hand to win the Hand Pot: the winner is the player with the highest hand value that is doesn't exceed 23. A player with a hand that totals exactly 23 or -23 has Pure Sabacc and wins the Sabacc Pot. Since unwon pots roll over into the next hand's Sabacc Pot, the Sabacc Pot can grow to be quite large.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Ortus Regni is a novel card game inspired by the late Anglo-Saxon period of English history. A time of warring Earls, claiming whatever lands they could... establishing fiefs, cultivating powerful vassals, fighting and engaging in endless political struggles &mdash; all while Vikings roamed not just the sea, but the land. It is truly a Dark Age. Or is it? Lasting for 600 years, until the Norman Conquest of 1066, this era decided the future of a great kingdom that would become England.&#10;&#10;Designing your Earl Deck before play begins is one of the key features of the game. Ortus Regni is a deck-design game, rather than a deck-building game &mdash; that is, you are entirely in control of the deck that you will begin play with in a game of Ortus Regni. Several canonical Ortus Regni deck design concepts exist &mdash; such as a Lord deck, an Army (Land) deck, a Politics deck, or an Emissary (Monk) deck, and more &mdash; but such concepts are only the start of your design options. The Earl Deck you put together can be a subtle hybrid of several concepts, or something entirely different and unusual.&#10;&#10;Your opponents in Ortus Regni will have access to exactly the same suite of cards that you do when they design their own Earl Decks for game play. So it all comes down to your choices and your strategies! There is also tactical space during a game to zig and zag, even if you find yourself against an Earl Deck design that you did not anticipate. You might pull out an unexpected win nonetheless if you play your deck well.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, a player chooses one of the actions, placing as many of her cats on it as she wants, with more cats leading to a stronger action. Each other player in turn can take the same action, but only at a strength of one cat. After each player has chosen an action, unchosen actions are sweetened for the next round, the start player marker rotates, then the next round starts.&#10;&#10;Players need to grow their herd of cats in order to take additional actions, but you must also feed your herd or else the cats will wander off into the forest or who knows where. At the end of the game, players score for the size of their feline herd, the amount of water supplied to their field, their supplies of food and gold, and a few other things. Whoever has the most points becomes the champion of this vivid forest!&#10;&#10;",

However, these said villages, towns and cities aren't big enough for the 2 (to 4) of yas'! So it's time to get busy and dirty, trading and searching for loot to fulfill the growing line of adventurers looking for some gear! Expand your shop, spend your Gold stock (or hoard it!) wisely, trade with other rival shops, keep secret Stock all to yourself, call in favors from your happy Clients.....do whatever it takes to clinch market Dominance and be the only show in town and start reeling in the BIG money! Who knows, maybe that Flaming Sword of Justice you just sold will be used by the Hero that will save the world?!&#10;&#10;RPGMT!! is a 30-60min 2-4 Player high strategy card game in which the player's goal is to finish the game with the best balance between: The amount of Client's orders they were able to fulfill; the amount of Gold they personally have by the end; and the total quality's worth of items in their Display.&#10;&#10;Each turn Players can take up to 2 &quot;Actions&quot; (unless they get extra Actions thanks to fulfilling certain Client orders) in their attempt to fulfill Client orders for certain weaponry or item...ry. These Actions let the Players manipulate their Stock items (or Hand cards) and/or their Display items (cards face up in front of a Player for everyone to see/trade) in specific ways to try and beat the rush to fulfill those orders! Ran out of Actions for your turn, but you're only ONE Action away from fulfilling that order?! No Worries!! There are &quot;Gold Actions&quot; that you can use in a pinch, which let you spend Gold to do certain Actions that DON'T count towards your Action limit for your turn....WOOHOO!! After all the Clients have been fulfilled, the game ends and Players then move on to calculating &quot;Dominance&quot;, which will determine who the TRUE Merchant Tycoon is!!&#10;&#10;The strategic decisions and stiff competition in RPGMT!! really heat up quick due to the fact that Players start out with only a limited number of Actions per turn AND a limited number of cards they can have, so EVERY decision counts! Everything from in what order you'd like to take your Actions, which Client you should fulfill, and should you or shouldn't you use Gold are crucial to Dominance. You might spend all your Action efforts to build up enough items to fulfill an order for a specific Client, but then the Player before you fulfills them leaving you at a disadvantage with items that you might not need now!! Remember, it's not just playing the current Client market, it's also knowing and playing to the weaknesses of your fellow Players!&#10;&#10;",

In the game, supply is crucial to keep your armies and navies fighting; destroy your enemies' supply lines and their forces will surrender!&#10;&#10;During play, you control one or more countries on either the Axis or Allied team and try to score as many victory points (VPs) for your team as you can through the use of cards or by occupying the starred supply spaces. Each major power has a unique set of cards with which to marshal its forces, which are represented by wooden army and navy pieces. After twenty rounds of play, the team with the most VPs wins.&#10;&#10;Note: The French edition of Quartermaster General, known as Quartermaster, includes the Quartermaster General: Air Marshal expansion that is sold separately in the English edition.&#10;&#10;",

You can move any crew you want, even if it belongs to someone else. If your crew gets pushed off the plank, it's out of the game. If your crew makes it to the rowboat, it's safe.&#10;&#10;Once all of the crew is off the ship, whoever has the most crew in the rowboat wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

While in their secret identity the players are safe from attack and can move into position. To attack Mephisto they have to change into their superhero identities. On the Zoom Spaces the heroes get to collect Power Cards to use in the fight against Mephisto.  If a Superhero succesfully attacks Mephisto, he gets a Talisman Card. The first Player who gets 3 Talisman Cards wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "From the rulebook:&#10;&#10;Hull Breach: Corporate Wars is a tactical, operational, and strategic space-combat and logistics card game for two or more players.&#10;&#10;Each player has his or her own deck of cards consisting of a Station, ships, modules, Marines, technological breakthroughs, events, and tactics. Players compete head-to-head to destroy each other's fleets and space station; the last player or team standing is the victor.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;Players choose from a variety of pre-constructed decks or can assemble their own, then each player takes turns either building up their base or building ships to attack their opponents. First player to destroy (or take over from boarding action) is the winner.&#10;&#10;Each faction/deck has a unique power and varied amounts of resources generated each turn. With these resources you can add on modules to your base, or play ships/marines to the table. Your base functions as a mothership where your subsequent ships make up the fleet you will use for offense and defense. Each turn you will get more resources based on your base and the modules attached (which can add to your resource generation).&#10;&#10;The ships and marines have different special abilities such as stealth (to avoid enemy detection). Some ships can even retrieve more ships from your deck at no cost.&#10;&#10;Combat is resolved with d10s. You count up the total amount your roll for offense (based on the current stats of the cards involved) then roll. The target roll is determined by the defense of the ship. Most small ships can only take 1 or 2 hits, but larger ships will need multiple hits to take down. Wounds do carry over but there are mechanisms to remove some wound tokens over time.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Second Edition Updated Rules&#10;&#10;Stackable Traits are no more! &#10;To reduce the amount of math that HB Commanders have to do in combat, traits that granted a +X ability are being retooled.  Values are now only the printed numbers, and do not increase with any +X effects.&#10;&#10;Trait-or-Fire!&#10;Use your weapons or a trait. That's one of the simplest rules in Hull Breach! It also now applies to stations as well &ndash; no more Target Painting for 4 and shooting 6 at the same target with your station. Stations should have advantages but testing reveals that certain station builds were becoming pwnmobiles, capable of ripping apart attacking fleets.&#10;&#10;Spicing Up Events!&#10;The tried-and-true Event cards now have two possible outcomes: a Critical outcome and a Nominal outcome. When you deploy the card, you make a D10 die roll to determine what you'll get. A roll of a 1 or a 10 is a Critical outcome, and is in some cases a more powerful result, and sometimes a bad result for the person wielding the card. Any other roll result is a Nominal outcome, which results in the 'usual' outcome for that card.&#10;&#10;Faction-Only Cards!&#10;Some cards, specifically some Marines, Upgrades and Events, are now marked as Faction-Only, meaning that only the faction printed on the card gets to use them. This has been done in an attempt to work a little more story flavor into the game. For example, Special Operations Groups represent the RDF Marine Corps' elite troops and are no longer available to non-RDF players. As compensation, Corporate Commanders can now field their own elite Marines known as Direct Assault Response Teams (DART).&#10;&#10;Module Overhaul!&#10;There have been significant changes in the world of Modules. In HB Alpha, Modules were further divided into Module-Ship, Module-Station, and Module-Marine cards. No longer! They've been broken into more obviously different types depending on what they attach to, and we've made a more clearer distinction of size on ships, Stations, and Modules. One of the new things we can do is attach multiple mods to ships, and Stations are a little more narrowly restricted to what they can or can't attach, depending on what the purpose of the station is (military versus economy).&#10;&#10;Say Goodbye to Characters!&#10;Character cards were a neat idea. Unfortunately they proved to be too frequently used as the basis for an entire deck strategy. So, they're all dead. Most, however, have been reborn as Add Personnel cards that can be attached to Marines and do something cool for your local units. The tradeoff is that they're no longer independent units that can board ships or stations and fire back at you, and they're nowhere near as powerful as they once were.&#10;&#10;First-Turn Facefisting is Ancient History!&#10;We have implemented a couple of new mechanics at game start that will alleviate most first-turn knockouts. We've achieved this by revising the initiative rules for the starting phase of the game: the Commander with the smallest fleet and Station size (printed on the card, and mentioned above), begins play after the Setup Phase. So, if you deploy fewer or smaller ships than your adversary, you take the first in-sequence turn of the game rather than leave it to a die roll for initiative.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;New Combat Mechanics!&#10;&#10;Initiative in Engagements&#10;Now controlled by unit size and progresses from the smallest ships up to the largest. The heavies are much slower and more cumbersome than your Fighters and Frigates, so they take longer to get into firing position.&#10;&#10;Attacker and Defender&#10;Volley fire at each other in turn, in order of smallest to largest, with the exception of the defending Station getting first shot.  So: Defender station, then attacker's fighters, defender's fighters, attacker's Frigates, etc, all the way up to Capital Ships.&#10;&#10;New Skirmish Phase&#10;The Interceptor Phase has been replaced by Skirmish.  Any ships with the trait Interceptor (defending) or Raider (attacking) get to jump to the head of the attack order line, for the first turn only.  No more extra turns for defenders!&#10;&#10;Boarding Actions&#10;Just like volley fire, boarding actions (now part of the Maneuver Phase) adhere to initiative rules: smaller ships act first, reflecting the idea that faster and more maneuverable craft have the advantage in landing Marines on-target. Boards are not declared until the start of the Maneuver Phase, and once they're all declared, Escort effects are applied and then they're resolved in ascending size order.  You can now only declare a board on a ship of equal class size or larger.&#10;&#10;",

Architect, mayor, planner, engineer and a spy will do all they can to create new places of public use so that living in your metropolis is more comfortable than anywhere else.&#10;&#10;In the centre of the Urban Panic play area is a main board with open city tiles placed on it. Next to the board lies a face-down pile with the remaining tiles. Each player receives a player board, and on this board you will build a city. In your turn, you have to perform actions of the architect which will enable you to take one tile from the main board. In the current turn, you can perform two more actions. You may exchange all of the revealed tiles with those from the pile, place a tile on your board, or change the places of two tiles on your board. Each building added to the city results in its development: number of residents, number of workplaces, ecology, revenue or the satisfaction of residents either increases or decreases. The most important thing is to fill the board with city tiles so that each tile is connected to the center of the board. You cannot forget to fulfill the needs of the residents. The winner is the player who not only builds and develops the city fastest, but avoids unemployment and takes care of the residents' needs.&#10;&#10;",

If he lands on the the spot as fellow player he may move the same number again immediatly.&#10;&#10;Instead of a bike race however, Auf Gehts! simulates a race of Biathlon. The card play is similiar to 6-Tage-Rennen, but the track features slopes and hill where slightly different rules apply. Every round there is a shooting, which is simulated by a real-time-dexterity element using a small &quot;Marble gun&quot;.&#10;&#10;First to cross the finish line is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Get Bit! Collectors Edition contains Walk the Plank!, Get Bit!, and Hold Your Breath! &mdash; three independent games that collectively tell a larger story.&#10;&#10;In Walk the Plank!, players represent the worst pirates in a captain's crew. The captain has rounded you all up because you're all lazy and stupid and simply not worth the rum and loot you get paid. That said, the captain has decided he's willing to keep two of you in his crew. To prove you're worthy, you will fight amongst yourselves, trying to shove other players' pirates off the end of the plank while keeping yours alive!&#10;&#10;Get Bit! is a card game in which the player pirates find themselves in the ocean, competing to stay alive as others are being eaten by a shark. The order of the swimmers is determined by simultaneously playing cards face down, then revealing the values. The number on each player's card determines position in line (higher numbers in front, lower numbers in back), however ties don't move. The swimmer at the back loses a limb to the shark and is flung to the front of the line! The process is repeated until only two swimmers remain on the table. When this happens, the swimmer at the front of the line wins the game!&#10;&#10;In Hold Your Breath!, the game is played in two rounds. In the first round each player may dive deeper, providing they have the &quot;Swim&quot; and &quot;Air&quot; cards to do so. Players press their luck each turn since it is the pirate who dives the deepest in round one AND resurfaces in round two who is the winner. Players can play &quot;Panic&quot;, &quot;Shark&quot; and other nasty cards on the other players, slowing their progress. In the second round each player struggles to reach the surface before they run out of air and therefore decide to take a rest (aka LOSE). Most of the pirates may not make it back to the surface, but the one who makes it back alive AND dove the deepest is the winner.&#10;&#10;Included in each copy is a bonus chipboard with a newly designed pirate ship, an additional &quot;Captain&quot; stand-up starting token, and even some hunger tokens to go with the now included Sharkspansion for Get Bit.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "One hundred and fifty years have passed since the first match in the Galactic Arena. This ancient mystical arena was originally located in an abandoned Serpente subsystem forgotten by time. After the First Apocalypse, the Terrans built endless numbers of space platforms to colonize space, and an agreement was brought forth between the Terrans and a mystical sect of great influence to lease the space platform CETUS-7. The ancient arena was rebuilt on top of the platform, taking the galactic fights into space.&#10;&#10;The Atomic Brotherhood holds all the broadcast rights for the Arena, netting them trillions of Credits for every minute of every fight. Their aptitude for organizing unconventional games makes them exceedingly popular with the masses, and now the time has come again. Gladiators from all over the galaxy are gathering on CETUS-7. Only five heroes will survive to face the coming Apocalypse. The Oracles have spoken the words: &quot;May the Zenites shine upon you.&quot; Those who cannot understand their meaning are destined to meet their doom.&#10;&#10;Apocalypse Universe: Galactic Arena, the first of five projects set in the Apocalypse Universe, is a strategic science fiction &quot;hero vs. hero&quot; game that takes place in the Galactic Arena of CETUS-7. The guiding principle of this game is replayability. Each hero has different stats and abilities, allowing unique builds that depend on player choice.&#10;&#10;The game is played by 2-6 players and can be played as 1vs1, 2vs2 or 3vs3. In 1vs1, the players follow a draft procedure and pick 1-3 heroes out of the ten available. After both players have chosen their heroes, they prepare them to enter the Arena. Heroes can equip weapons and special abilities before combat. The arena board consists of a grid of hexagons with starting positions, secret traps, and treasure crates.&#10;&#10;Both players secretly choose, then reveal heroes, placing them on the two starting positions of the board. The hero with the highest initiative score plays first. The player controlling him is considered the attacker and his opponent is the defender. Each hero has a number of action points that can be used to perform his special abilities, to defend, or to attack. A ten-sided die is used for attacking and defending. The attacking player adds his hero's attack score to his attack roll and the defending player respectively adds his hero's defense score to his defense roll. When a hero is wounded, he loses health points &mdash; and at zero health, he's defeated.&#10;&#10;",

Alexander vs. Persia is compatible with all other Battleground armies; each AvP army can be played against any others in the Battleground system.&#10;&#10;To simulate Alexander and his generals leading from the front, the Alexander army features the ability to attach general-specific command cards to a unit and then to replay the card on that unit.  The large and relatively unwieldy Persian army enables its general to sacrifice command actions at the start of the game in order to receive extra points for army building.&#10;&#10;There are official solitaire rules for the Battleground series of games downloadable at the company website.&#10;&#10;",

The player throws the cubes and tries to form words in crossword or Scrabble fashion as quickly as possible. Jokers appear on two of the cube faces. The challenge is that all words must be connected. Each letter has a point value, and the summed value of those used is the positive score while points are deducted for those unused. Letters used in more than one word are counted for each word.&#10;&#10;Other known editions are 1973 and 1975, which were published under the label &quot;E.S.

Pick the prime locations, corner a market or undercut your opponents to win.&#10;&#10;Scarborough Fair is not a complicated game to learn and is fairly quick to play, but it has enough strategy to keep more seasoned gamers interested.

On a turn, a player rolls the blue storm die and either moves 1-3 clouds or stands in place eating a muffin, forgetting all about the race, the crystals, and everything else. If you land on a pink cloud, you roll the crystal die and receive 1-3 crystals; if you land on a present, you give someone else a crystal from the reserve; and if you land on the front end of a rainbow, you slide along the path to the next cloud. Whoever reaches the final cloud first claims the four crystals there, then players compare their holdings to see who horned their way to victory.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, she rolls the die, then takes a seaside card of that color, flips it over to reveal the rocks on the other side, then places it in a path leading from the island. If on a future turn, she rolls a color that's already in her path, instead of adding another tile to her path, her sheep crosses a number of rocks equal to the number of rocks of the rolled color in her path.

        "description": "Players in Taxi Wildlife want to give rides to as many animals as they can, while also traveling far into the forest.&#10;&#10;To set up, each player takes a colored start cards, each of which shows a single path on one edge that branches into two paths at the opposite edge. Players place two each of six kinds of animals into two separate bags; someone shuffles the duel cards (after first removing any colors not in play), then places the four round cards in numerical order. Shuffle the three stacks of route cards, then reveal one card from each deck; each route card depicts an animal on the sign next to a taxi stop and some cards also show the animal on the card.&#10;&#10;In each round, you'll draw the duel cards one by one, and for each duel card the two players shown on the card each take a bag, then race to find one of the animals depicted on a face-up route card in their bag &mdash; without looking inside the bag, mind you. If a player finds the wrong animal, then the opponent can still find one; if the player finds the right animal, he takes the matching route card from the display and tries to add it to his start card on either the left or right side. The number of paths on adjacent cards must match! If they don't match, the player returns the card, gaining nothing, and the next duel card is drawn. In addition, if the route card actually depicts the animal in question, the player keeps the animal token instead of returning it to the bag.&#10;&#10;Once all the duel cards have been used, shuffle them and reveal the next round card. After four complete rounds or after one stack of route cards is empty, the game ends. Each player scores one point for each route card in her path and each animal in her collection; whoever has the high score wins!&#10;&#10;",

The game mechanics have been streamlined, tightened, and improved over many years of play. New cards have been added that reflect the changes in music and the industry since the first Battle of the Bands incarnation.

This year there are six new wrestlers debuting, so go out and win some matches!&#10;&#10;Over the four seasons of maskmen, whoever has won the most points is the winner.  In a round, players can play cards or pass on their turn. Players play 1-3 cards on their turn of the same type of wrestler (that hasn't already been played), to help resolve the strength of the wrestler. The faster you get rid of your cards, the better your chances of winning. As soon as you rid your cards you get to take the highest point token available, then the next player to go out gets the next token. Once there is only one player remaining, the round ends and that player gets the -1 token.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In Grad Wars all players are students in different Universities. Their aim is to get their degree before everyone else does by passing 20 lessons first. They do this either by studying hard, or by visiting the other players in their classroom and harassing them.&#10;&#10;Players can pass up to 5 lessons in every turn. They get their grade by rolling a 10-sided die for every lesson and then modifying the die with cards thrown by themselves or other players.&#10;&#10;Cards can be adding or subtracting from a grade, and they can be special cards. But basically they describe student life as it is, or rather as we think it is. Players drink tons of coffee, they get shut in in bunkers to study focused, and they give exams using a Divine Pen. They also invade other players&rsquo; homes to sabotage their alarm clock, and they cause a Zombie Apocalypse inside other players&rsquo; classrooms. And they start crying in front of professors to get a passing grade, they cheat like there is no tomorrow, and they go to parties that cause year-long hangovers. Grad Wars is a game for the students who want to get their degree first no matter what the cost, or the means.&#10;&#10;&Sigma;&tau;&omicron; &pi;&alpha;&iota;&chi;&nu;&#206;&#175;&delta;&iota; &alpha;&upsilon;&tau;&#207;&#140;

You can never know how long you&lsquo;re going to be left sitting high and dry. Cheekily, he&lsquo;s throned high up in the crow&lsquo;s nest and is smirking joyfully over so many riches. It&lsquo;s no surprise that the ship&lsquo;s crew is fuming and want their belongings back!&#10;&#10;Find the objects that Flynn has stashed away in the crow&lsquo;s nest. A die shows you what you have to look for. Like in the trick with the table cloth you have to pull a cord stick to a card and hope that the Flynn stays in his nest and that the nest is not toppling over.&#10;&#10;",

Call forth your champions to battle against those of your timeless foes. Harness the legacy of each champion's deeds as they echo across time to empower the next. For the Champions of Aerim, this cycle continues, as it always has and always will. For the Eternals, there is only...strife.&#10;&#10;Strife, a two-player strategy card game that plays in around an hour, is a game where you always know your opponent's options. Aside from mastering the unique combo-creating gameplay of your champions, figuring out how to outmaneuver your opponent is where the true challenge lies.&#10;&#10;Each player has the same hand of ten champions and will simultaneously play them as they fight over key locations throughout Aerim worth varying victory points. Each champion has a battle ability that's triggered during battles and a legacy ability that can be used only while on top of the legacy pile. This creates an intricate latticework of strategy for the players as each champion must be considered for not only what he can do in the current battle, but for which ability he will add to the next.&#10;&#10;Further impacting the critical decisions within the game is the Fatestone tie-breaking system. The Fatestone starts at a value of one, and whoever holds the Fatestone die loses all ties; that player may instead pass the stone to his opponent to claim a victory in that tie, but doing so raises the value of the Fatestone by one each time it is passed. At the end of the game, the player holding the Fatestone adds its final value to his victory point tally. Whichever player has the most victory points at the end of the game wins!&#10;&#10;",

That's almost 2.5 million extra games every day.&#10;&#10;Back in 2006, Ted Alspach provided a solution to this problem with a simple card game called Start Player. Just turn over a card, and you'll know who the start player is.&#10;&#10;That was a wonderful solution...for 2006. But we're clearly living in the future now, and there's no time for getting out the box, shuffling cards, and finally turning a card over. It's time for something better, faster, and a whole lot more technologically advanced. It's time for Start Player Express.&#10;&#10;Start Player Express consists of four custom dice. There's no shuffling, there's a whole lot less reading, and there's no messing with a box. (You're not a Neanderthal, are you?) Just roll the dice and BOOM! You know who goes first.&#10;&#10;",

Each creature can evolve into three different evolution trees, each with their own unique skills.&#10;&#10;Evilution is a stand-alone card game. Each player chooses four animals to start the game with and performs actions each turn to further their position. Once you kill all the opposing creatures, you win the game.&#10;&#10;In order to evolve your animals, you'll need to purchase evolution trees. You can earn money through sponsorships as well as completing objectives. You can also use the money to hire lab assistants and purchase equipment.&#10;&#10;Also, every turn you'll either navigate random events or discover potions with good and bad effects. Some of your creatures may die, but that's a sacrifice you must be willing to make.&#10;&#10;Do you have what it takes to be the best Mad Scientist? Only time will tell.&#10;&#10;",

It has several play modes:&#10;&#10;1. Crosswords: One player rolls all 13 dice and forms words in a crossword puzzle shape. Players agree on the length of the round (between 2-5 minutes) and the number of rounds before the start of the game. Letters used score their point value. Letters used in two words score for both words. Letters not used are subtracted from the score.&#10;&#10;When a player finishes making words, players can try to make a funny sentence with the words.&#10;&#10;2. Letter Yatzi: The first player rolls all 13 dice and tries to form the longest word. Letters which don't fit are rolled again. At least one letter must be put aside each time. Play continues until all letters are used or set aside. Points are scored for the letters used. Unused letters are not counted.&#10;&#10;If a player uses all 13 letters, the score for the word is doubled.&#10;&#10;3. Vocabulary: All players together make one word, with all 13 dice if possible. One player is chosen as the secretary. Players try to make words with the letters of the first word, and the secretary keeps track of them. The winner is the player who can find the last intelligible word.&#10;&#10;",

Send your gang on jobs by matching their stats to what the job requires and roll some dice to find out if they brought back some loot, earned you some reputation, or got shot in the process. The characters and jobs all come from a communal field, so you'll have to plan ahead and act quickly to get the good stuff. &#10; The player with the most reputation will win the game, and rep only comes from doing jobs, so you won't get ahead by playing it safe. You'll have to take chances, and your posse will probably die, but that's just the nature of the game for The Outlaws.&#10;&#10;",

This trick-taking game is the basis for Ulti, the national card game of Hungary.&#10;&#10;It is played with a 32-card deck, similar to the William Tell deck but with specific Bohemian art. There are four suits: hearts, bells, acorns, and leaves, each with eight cards: ace, king, over-knave, under-knave, 10, 9, 8, and 7.&#10;&#10;The most common setup is with three players, with one player playing alone against a partnership of the other two for each hand. The lone player seeks to win more card points than the other two players together. Points are received for winning aces and tens in tricks, winning the last trick, and for the combination of king and over-knave of a suit. There are also several bonuses and penalties that affect the final score.&#10;&#10;(Description borrowed from Mari&aacute;&scaron; page on pagat.com)&#10;&#10;",

Games provide a good alternative, but in most &quot;educational&quot; games, the learning comes slowly as players must wait their turn to get a question and rarely get the same question twice in the same game.&#10;&#10;In State Master, all players participate in every turn, so everyone is learning and testing their knowledge constantly. Player who get the wrong answer take a quick moment to study all six facts on the state card and then try to get the same card the next turn, immediately putting their new knowledge to use.&#10;&#10;State Master is fun for all ages and its a game in which younger players can often beat older players as they tend to be better at retaining facts.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;================&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;================&#10;&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS&#10;2 to 6&#10;&#10;OBJECTIVE&#10;Finish the game with the most cards.&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS&#10;50 State Cards&#10;6 Colored Dice&#10;1 Category Die&#10;1 Map Card&#10;&#10;SETUP&#10;Shuffle State Cards.&#10;Place 5 State Cards on the table with the flag side up for each player in the game: 10 cards if there are 2 players, 15 cards if there are 3 players, etc.&#10;Place the Blank Map face up on the table.&#10;Place the Filled Map face down on the table.&#10;Each player chooses a colored die.&#10;&#10;ROUND PLAY&#10;Each player rolls his/her die to decide who will be Player 1 for Round 1.&#10;Player 1 puts his/her die on top of one of the State Cards.&#10;Moving clockwise, each player puts his/her die on of a different State Card.&#10;Player 1 then rolls the Category Die.&#10;Each player, starting with Player 1 and moving clockwise, must then say the correct answer for his/her chosen state for the category shown. For example, if the die says &quot;CAPITAL,&quot; a player with his/her die on New York would say &quot;Albany.&quot;&#10;If a player correctly answers the category question, that player tries to locate his/her state on the Blank Map.&#10;&#10;ENDING A ROUND&#10;Players who answer correctly and are able to locate their states win their cards. All others replace them face down on the table (but not before studying the card a little so they can get the right answer the next round).&#10;&#10;WINNING THE GAME&#10;Rounds continue until fewer State Cards remain face down than there are players in the game. The player with the most State Cards at end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Their goal is to transport photographs with a hot-air balloon  at locations in the state to their towers (transmitting the scoop back to their news agencies). Each player starts with one photo card, and take turns to roll a die, moving their card by the die's result. They draw new photo cards on a &quot;6&quot;. The reporters can deploy Stop Stones to stop other reporters from moving through. The first reporter to transmit back three photographs wins the game.&#10;&#10;The second mode of the game is called Top Secret, which is played on the other side of the game board.

        "description": "A high speed death race against the clock. Drivers have a limited time to out wit, out manoeuvre and out pace the competition. Their fission powered Skimmers speed along future highways ramming each other and firing dangerous energy weapons to try and secure a win in the controversial Light-Speed Cup. When the race starts the clock starts and players have until the time runs out to wipe their opponents off of the track. They can aggressively pursue the other racers and try to destroy them, they can speed ahead and try to force the other vehicle off of the end of track or they can duck and dodge allowing the other Skimmers to tear each other apart before speeding home to victory. Which ever player&rsquo;s Skimmer is in the best condition when the clock reaches zero wins the Cup. This game is a thrill packed adrenaline ride where mayhem reigns and there is never a dull moment!The LSC moto is Action Not Protraction!&#10;&#10;This games puts 2-6 players in control of one Skimmer (futuristic race car) each. They race each other along an never ending  treadmil like race track that is made out of 4 rolling tiles. When the race starts an electronic timer is started, it has between 10 and 15 minutes on it per player, and when the timer runs out and the buzzer souds the game is over. Durring the game players have to ram and shoot at each other to try and destroy the enemy skimmers before the timer runs out. Each skimmer has different strengths and weaknesses and players get to choose their own drivers which also have unique talents. There is another way of destroy other skimmers and that is to get so far ahead of them that when the track is rolled they fall off of the back of it. In this way the lightly amoiured fast skimmers can win the game aswell.&#10;&#10;",

The flax grown in the land surrounding the village makes it a profitable place to work and live. Fields of Arle takes players through four and a half years of this era of prosperity, with different opportunities available as the seasons change. Farm the land to capitalize on the demand for flax, or find other ways to make the most of the small town&rsquo;s prosperity.&#10;&#10;Work the Land&#10;Whether you delve into flax farming or leverage other areas of expertise, always make sure that you have the land to build up your village. Construct dikes to keep the waters at bay and expand your fields. Dry out bogs to harvest peat and then clear the land for cultivation. Create more fields for your livestock, buildings, or future crops; after that, you can decide whether to house animals or cultivate a forest for timber. Perhaps you&rsquo;d like to take up some flax farming for yourself, or diversify and try out a little bit of everything.&#10;&#10;Tools of the Trade&#10;At the outset of each half year, you&rsquo;ll choose how you&rsquo;d like to spend that time working. There are many ways to build your fortune. Use the Master space to increase the tools at your disposal, focus on the Cattle Trainer to make the most of your livestock, or build up your fleet of vehicles and ship out goods. Taking stock of your progress differs depending on the season. You may milk your existing livestock or care for a bunch of newborn animals. You could harvest your flax in the fall, and sheer your sheep in spring. At the end of each half year, you&rsquo;ll need to take stock of your progress by unloading your vehicles and feeding your family and animals, so keep an eye on the season and do your best to keep the farm growing and everyone well fed!&#10;&#10;Travel and Prosper&#10;Once you&rsquo;ve made headway in clearing fields and stocking up goods, it's time to make your products available to potential buyers. The more vehicles you have, the more goods you can ship. Send things into the wide world to increase your Travel Experience and grant you points over the course of the four and a half years of the game. Build up your farm and your vehicles and get your goods out into the world to make the most of every season.

To win, find that map and hold on to it, surviving the round - or be the last pirate alive with the lowest ranking card.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;&bull; Each player is dealt two cards.&#10;&#10;&bull; Players can choose to use one or two cards against their opponents, discard and draw a new card, or bluff.&#10;&#10;&bull; A player can bluff as long as they have at least one card of the card type needed to perform an action in their &#10;hand.&#10;&#10;Example: Danielle has one &ldquo;Barrel o&rsquo; Grog&rdquo; card and one &ldquo;Cannon&rdquo; card in her hand. She decides that she wants to use the &#10;special ability that requires two &ldquo;Barrel o&rsquo; Grog&rdquo; cards. This special requires that every player with a &ldquo;Barrel o&rsquo; Grog&rdquo; &#10;card must place the grog card face up in front of them.  That card is out of play for the rest of the game.  Those players now may only have one card in their hand.&#10;&#10;&bull; If a player does not believe that another player has the cards to do the action they just performed, they may call &#10;the player&rsquo;s bluff.  If the first player was lying, they have to reveal the card that was the lie, and they discard their remaining card and draw a new one.&#10;&#10;Example: John doesn&rsquo;t believe Danielle has two &ldquo;Barrel o&rsquo; Grog&rdquo; cards. He calls her bluff. As Danielle did not have &#10;two &ldquo;Barrel o&rsquo; Grog&rdquo; cards, she places the &ldquo;Cannon&rdquo; card in front of her, as it was the lie - and that card is now &#10;out of play. She then discards her &ldquo;Barrel o&rsquo; Grog&rdquo; and draws a new card.  She is now down to having only one card in her hand.&#10;&#10;&bull; When the deck runs out of cards, the discard pile may be shuffled back in to form the draw pile.&#10;&#10;&bull; When there are no more cards to be drawn and no discard pile, the players that are still alive reveal their hands and what is stored in their &ldquo;Smuggler's Chambers&rdquo;.  The player with the lowest numbered card wins.&#10;&#10;Drop Box location for PnP rules are located here.&#10;Drop Box location for high-quality PnP card art is located here.&#10;&#10;This game won first place for the 24 hour contest - March 2014.&#10;&#10;",

Additionally, it incorporates an economic dimension; you can produce or buy dope, and sell it by striking deals with other players rather than confronting them. As every narco knows, spilling blood ain&rsquo;t always good for business.&#10;&#10;Finally, Deal: American Dream also has a roleplaying aspect to it; each player has secret objectives that require the use of deception and bluff. Regardless of which avenue to power you take, in the end, there can only be one winner: the first one to earn 10 respect points takes the cake. Every game of Deal: American Dream is unique and brings its share of negotiation, alliance and, of course, backstabbing!&#10;&#10;All the components needed for a game of Deal Corner can be found in the Deal: American Dream's box.

The player must drive hostile tribes from the southern plains, establish dominance over the region, set up trade networks with both friendly tribes and colonial powers, and finally defend all of this against relentless military and cultural attack.&#10;&#10;While many mechanics will feel similar to Navajo Wars, Comancher&iacute;a is a very different game. Comancher&iacute;a promises to deliver all the tough decisions and drama that Navajo Wars players have come to expect, but with a faster playing time and more streamlined victory objectives.&#10;&#10;",

The command ship is a mobile factory, research lab, and ship carrier. Players will use it to construct the fleets that help spread their influence far and wide.&#10;&#10;The modular space map is built from randomized tiles each game as players explore. The random map generation ensures no two games of Space Frontier are exactly the same.&#10;&#10;Players gain influence through missions, research, trade, or conquest. Players can be as cooperative or antagonistic with each other as they wish. Thus, games can be played and won where military might reigns supreme, or without a shot being fired.&#10;&#10;",

The object of the game is to reach the end of each game board, which supposedly represent a different mission:&#10;&#10;Game 1: Rescue April&#10;Game 2: Take Over The Technodrome&#10;Game 3: Battle to Stop the Ooze&#10;Game 4: Race for the Pizza Parlor&#10;&#10;These four boards came on the back of the Ralston Cereal Boxes and as such are in conjunction a very simplistic version of similar games like &quot;Snakes and Ladders&quot;. Just throw the dice and let luck decide in which space you&acute;ll end up. Some spaces have rewards while others punishments. In reality is what you can expect from a board game that came on a cereal box, but it has a lot of charm and richness of details in the drawings and graphic design.&#10;&#10;There was another Ralston&acute;s TMNT cereal box board game called &quot;Adventures In Turtleopolis&quot; that came out during the same time, but it didn&acute;t have art as nice as this nor as much TMNT thematic enemies and elements such as the Technodrome or the sewers.&#10;&#10;",

If the total number of the revealed penguin cards matches the corresponding penguin player's status card, everyone must race to SMASH that player's hand on the table. The first player to smash the penguin player's hand scores all the corresponding penguin cards. The player who manages to SMASH the most penguin will be the master of penguin smash and win the game.&#10;&#10;Be alert!

There are also two environment squares that will be occupied with the pathogens before they invade your organism. In addition, the board shows different human cells (red blood cells, immune cells, platelet, etc) that can be bought with oxygen. These cells are responsible for eliminating pathogens.&#10;&#10;There are 3 types of deck cards in the game. Pathogen cards can be placed on the environment squares of the rivals, in order to infect and harm their organs. Medic cards can be used to prevent damage, transplant organs, eradicate microorganisms, etc. There is a common deck for all the players, the environmental deck, which represents hazardous effects that can affect the health of a person, like occupational accidents, blood donation and school fights.&#10;&#10;The game emulates in a proper way some aspects of the immunity, like the inflammation, adverse effects of medicaments, the disease transmission, the spread of tumors, and many others.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "You are at the helm in the fight for the future of the planet. Will you command the Alien Fleet or defend Humankind? Power up and scan the battlefield for locations to conceal your highly detailed, movie-based ships. Then, brace yourself for battle as electronic voice commands and sound effects signal your search-and-destroy mission to take out your opponent&rsquo;s ships. Play on your own or battle a friend, and choose from three edge-of-your seat missions!&#10;&#10;Deluxe Battleship Movie Edition has its gameplay based upon Battleship Advance Mission. There are three game modes: Classic game (One attack per turn), Multi-attack game (go again if you hit an enemy ship), Salvo game (make 1 attack for every ship you have in play). Deluxe mission also has two weapon modes: attack with only one coordinate at a time, or use advanced weapons that let you scan for enemies, shoot down enemy plans, or launch missiles for massive attacks.&#10;&#10;Differences from Battleship Movie Edition:&#10;&#10;Has a computer, and adds search jets, and has a 10*14 field. The two player boards are joined in the middle. The ships are smaller and less detailed. Does not come with cards.&#10;&#10;Identical to the Advanced Mission version, with the exception of alien ships, a lighter board, and and an alien voice instead of a female one.&#10;&#10;Green Electronic Battleship Advanced Mission differences from the earlier, blue box edition:&#10;&#10;- improved voices and sounds (earlier said to be hard to understand)&#10;&#10;- the original game play in a bigger, 10 x 14, grid, Salvo mission, and Target Plus One Mission, or Bonus Mission.&#10;&#10;- advanced weapons can now be used in Salvo and Bonus Missions&#10;&#10;- the Attack Squadron planes now move and scan on the same turn, and the planes now scan the space immediately underneath them.&#10;&#10;- the Aircraft Carrier missiles were eliminated. The Attack Squadron planes are equipped with a one-time use only missile that automatically hits every space where it detects an enemy target. It does that on the first target found only, and then it only scans.&#10;&#10;- the Battleship has one Tomahawk missile that hits everything in the 3 x 3 square where it lands.&#10;&#10;- the now-called Light Missile Cruiser has two Harpoon Missiles that covers three vertical or horizontal spaces.&#10;&#10;- the Fast-Attack Sub has two torpedoes that travel from one side to the other of the grid unless it hits a target first. The Sub also has a scanner that will tell you that an enemy ship is in the vicinity but will not tell you the precise location unlike the Attack Squadron Planes.&#10;&#10;- the new design has a raised, inverted-Y design.&#10;&#10;- the ships are redesigned.&#10;&#10;-  there are different colored lights to indicated launches, scans, hits and misses.&#10;&#10;",

They can match any icon and each of the three Joker hextuples can be used to match six cards at once. They have no point value when played, but make sure you play them, because their value switches to 100 points and count against your score if left in your inventory.&#10;&#10;Ending Rounds&#10;&#10;Keep playing until all the cards in the pile are drawn. Then play until someone has played all their cards or until no other play can be made. Each player then adds up the card values left in their inventory and subtracts the sum from their score.&#10;&#10;Ending Play&#10;&#10;If you play multiple rounds, you can add the scores from each round to determine the winner. Or, you can treat each round separately and award a point to the player with the highest score for each round, and the winner is the player who won the most rounds.&#10;&#10;",

The map has NYC (and neighboring Jersey) separated into 6 boroughs, distinguished by color palette: Manhattan in red, The Bronx in orange, Staten Island in yellow, Queens in green, Brooklyn in blue, and Jersey in purple. Each borough contains neighborhoods. These are actual neighborhoods, but the size and boundary are exaggerated in this map for game play. Neighborhoods attached by bridges, tram or subway are also considered adjacent.&#10;&#10;The objective is to occupy all neighborhoods on the map with your player cubes by systematically booting out neighboring players by rolling higher dice values than the other players.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Speakeasy is a 75-minute, hidden role/social deduction game for 10-40 people, similar to games like Werewolf, The Resistance, or Two Rooms and a Boom. It is simple to learn, but has lots of room for strategy and rewards repeat playing. Speakeasy can be played at home, in a pub, or anywhere the group can fit. It is not turn-based and is played as you move around and mingle (or avoid) other players - the game happens continuously at the speed of your strategy.&#10;&#10;THE STORY&#10;It&#202;&#188;s the Roaring Twenties, and corruption is on the rise in your city. The Mob rules the streets, and its reach extends even further&mdash;to the police force, the courts, and even City Hall. The Mob&#202;&#188;s crews of thieves, hitmen, bootleggers, dirty lawyers, speakeasy owners, con artists and cops on the take think they hold the real reins of power in this city.&#10;&#10;The long arm of the law has grown shorter of late, but citizens have reason to hope. An organization of crime fighters unafraid to take a stand has emerged as a force strong enough to oppose the Mob. This crew of untouchables, vigilantes, undercover cops, honest politicians, and special agents are rallying under the new Federal Marshal in town, proving the city the forces of good might be down, but they aren&#202;&#188;t out!&#10;&#10;Now it&#202;&#188;s time for you to choose a side and play your part in deciding the fate of the city&mdash;for better or worse.&#10;&#10;OVERVIEW&#10;Speakeasy is a game of creative deception, hidden identities, and strategy. To start, one player volunteers as Moderator and gives everyone a secret role on one of two teams: the Mob or the Feds. The fog of war is thick in the beginning, as players&#202;&#188; first task is to use their secret passwords to identify who to trust. As the game goes on, players learn how to hustle as they continue to identify and organize their teammates, discover the other team&#202;&#188;s secrets, sow misinformation, infiltrate the opposition, and score points&mdash;all while watching their own backs. Play ends after one hour, and the winning team is the one that accrues the most points.&#10;&#10;For more information and updates, visit thegamehaschanged.net/speakeasy or www.kickstarter.com/projects/1894392880/speakeasy-a-mob-themed-hidden-role-party-game&#10;&#10;PDF OF RULES AND STRATEGY GUIDE&#10;To see the rules for Speakeasy, just email speakeasyrules@gmail.com.&#10;&#10;",

Putting the ball in the final line of the pitch triggers a Scoring Opportunity phase, which is a mini-game in itself and is performed using shooting and goalkeeping cards.&#10;&#10;The game contains 32 ready-to-play national teams of variable strength.

Each player controls a space refinery and four repulse cruisers. A turn consists of moving a piece one space in any direction, jumping a cruiser in or out of hyperspace (off the board; jumping in allows the cruiser to go to any space), or firing a cruiser's repulsion beam at an asteroid. The beam causes the asteroid to move away from the cruiser; ideally the player's space refinery is on the other side of the asteroid, allowing it to be captured. The player who manages to capture three of the six asteroids wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Using identical sets of color-coded letters, two players match vocabularies by drawing, bidding and playing, crossword style, as many letters per word as possible. As the grid fills up, the players may begin to risk their turns in an effort to make longer words than the opponent. The final outcome remains undetermined until a player has drawn the last letter and the opponent cannot catch up.&#10;&#10;Description:&#10;&#10;Alphabid is played on an 18x18 square grid. As indicated by the description in the rules, each player has an identical set of tiles. However, each starts off with a random selection of eight of these. After the first turn, a player must start their turn by &quot;bidding&quot; the number of tiles they think they can play; this entitles them to draw that many tiles, after which they can raise their bid in order to draw more tiles. After they have bid as high as they want (or they have eight tiles, which is the maximum) they must play at least as many letters as they bid. If a player plays eight tiles on a turn they draw eight more without having to bid.&#10;&#10;Play follows standard Scrabble rules: words are played left-to-right or top-to-bottom and all orthogonally adjacent letters must form words.&#10;&#10;Plays do not score points. Instead, the object is to draw all of one's tiles. If both players manage to do this on the same turn, the player who has the fewest tiles left wins.&#10;&#10;",

Very frequently such  actions  in which relatively small  units  fought  on  both sides were important because of operational or moral context. Thanks to versatile rules it is possible to depict any military action from XX century.&#10;&#10;Primosole Bridge is a wargame that uses the Great Battles of Small Units ruleset. Battle for Primosole Bridge was divided into two scenarios. In first, British paratroopers have to defend the bridge from the counterattacking German units. At the very beginning, staying true to problems that landing Allied units faced, players have to resolve what forces are available to Aliied side. In game there are units, that historically didn`t reach the battlefield. It is possible therefore to examine the possible outcome if air drop would have been more successful. In second scenario the British are a stronger side. Yet it doesn`t mean easy victory for them. First, they have not only to occupy the bridge but also the road leading to Catania. Germans occupy favorable terrain and their defense line is well prepared. Germans can also attempt to destroy the bridge and stop the attackers.&#10;&#10;Game has tried-and-true hex and counter mechanic but with an added twist: random element is handled in this game by a deck of regular cards (which players have to supply themselves) - like combat and random events.&#10;&#10;Game also has also ruleset that is relatively easy to grasp. It can therefore serve as an introduction to the board wargaming hobby&#10;&#10;",

At some points they have to leave the main track and use the side trails. If a player reaches a numbered space he has to answer a question. If he gives a wrong answer, he has to go back to the last red space and use the next available side trail. If he gives a wrong answer on a side trail, he has to wait a turn before he may move again. When a player gets on an occupied space, he kicks the other player back to the last red space. The first player who is back at the starting space wins the game.&#10;&#10;This game was published in the early 1970s.&#10;&#10;",

For balance, effects are weighted, and action points are used.&#10;&#10;A distribution of negative points, rather than the pursuit of positive points, is intended to encourage closer games. There is a set-collection sub-game for players who get loaded up on negative points early where they can access special abilities.  There is also a trading mechanic and simultaneous monster combat.&#10;&#10;",

Each player is given a tile with a basket depictured which is a pawn. The pawns are moved on a triangle shaped board which contains of 45 hex tiles with fruits on them.&#10;&#10;On a single turn a player takes his pawn and moves it by a number of hexes indicated on the tile he starts from. The player can turn freely but cannot move through the same hex twice. After the movement the player takes the tile he started from and put it in his/her personal supply. There is one restriction in taking tiles. A player cannot take a tile if this would cause the board to split up. In this case the player moves without taking a tile.&#10;&#10;If in 4 consecutive turns none of the players takes a tile, the game ends. Then the players compare their fruits. Each fruit is worth one point, but a player will take the points only if he is one of the two players (one in a 2-player game) that has the biggest amount of this particular fruit. Other players do not score points for this kind of fruit. The player who scored the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

El joc de cartes is a trick-taking card game loosely based on the novel Victus by Albert S&agrave;nchez Pi&ntilde;ol and set during the siege of Barcelona of 1713-1714, the last act of the War of the Spanish Succession.&#10;&#10;In the game, players play the role of the main characters of the novel, divided in two sides: the Catalans defending Barcelona (Mart&iacute; Zuviria and Antoni de Villarroel), and the French-Spanish army storming the city (Berwick, Popoli and van Verboom). The only player whose identity is public is Zuviria, the other characters are hidden until one of them decides to show himself or until some cards force them to do so. Each trick is won by the player who has played the first card of the suit with most points. But some additional character cards can change the rules for winning a trick in some rounds.&#10;&#10;After the last trick, each side adds up their points: for each color (not to be confused with the suits), two points for the side with most cards of that color; and 3 points for the side which has more completed &quot;VICTUS&quot; words (each card has also a letter from the word VICTUS).&#10;&#10;",

The winner is the player who had the last microbe alive, or is the first player to begin their turn with 5 microbes.&#10;&#10;In addition to the beginning and ending administrative phases of each player's turn, the 3 key phases are the Metabolism Phase, the Drift Phase, and the Action Phase.  During the Metabolism Phase, the player must choose to pay food or take damage to fuel their turn's activity.  The Drift Phase involves randomly determining where to place food, toxins, and special particles on the game board available for all players to consume.  The Action Phase allows players to choose one action: Hunting &amp; Gathering (includes moving, eating, and attacking), Evolving, Mutating, OR Subdividing.&#10;&#10;Evolving costs a player 3 food, but allows them to draw an evolution card at random which grants their microbe(s) abilities, possibly to move further, attack harder, and/or have some other unique ability.  Mutating costs a player 4 food (and one evolution - if any), but it increases the total number of evolution cards a player can have in play, the base movement, and the base damage of the player's microbe(s).  Mutation also allows some damage to be healed.  Subdividing costs a player 5 food per subdivision, but each subdivision creates a new microbe on the board for the player, allowing them alternate start locations each turn, an extra life should a microbe be destroyed, and moves the player closer to a win condition.&#10;&#10;",

Then in clockwise, the other players must play the same card and declare &quot;big&quot; or &quot;small&quot; if they have, or pass if they don't. Small effects are granted to all players who declared &quot;small&quot;, but the big effect only goes to one of the players who declared &quot;big&quot;, and if the Governor is involved, it's the Governor that grabs the big effect.&#10;&#10;Everyone else tends to be worried about the Governor's hand.

        "description": "Drakerys is a fantasy world where Dwarves, Elves, Orcs and Humans reign over ancient kingdoms. Elemental magic created the world and went into slumber for centuries, leaving myths about dreadful and marvelous creatures ruling over the living. Everybody knows fairies and trolls are just stuff of legends, right? Wrong! A few weeks ago, an adventurer awoke a powerful dragon and triggered a chain of events leading to the destruction of an empire. Magic is returning in a world shaken by sudden chaos. Armies are assembling to repel the awakening creatures and seize power!&#10;&#10;In Drakerys, each player chooses a side, gathers miniature troops and takes the lead against other players in story-driven skirmish battles. The terrain setting as well as the victory conditions are laid out by a battle scenario all players agreed upon. The fate of warriors is determined through combat rules and some rolls of dice. As a war leader, you&rsquo;ll need tactical insight - and a bit of luck - to win!&#10;&#10;The Starter Box contains everything you'll need to discover miniature games and enjoy Drakerys. Two armies are featured with fully assembled miniatures: the Human Paladins of Irosia and the wild Orcs of Ashral.&#10;&#10;As the story begins, they are pitted against each other in a campaign to conquer a mysterious archipelago filled with danger, secrets about the magical events to come, not to mention countless treasures! The winning side will take an important advantage in the beginning war.&#10;&#10;The old world is about to crumble. It&rsquo;s a time of heroes. Will you be the king of tomorrow? Find out with Drakerys!&#10;&#10;The game uses classic fantasy army building with an fresh twist: players use a special Action Wheel to determine whose turn is it to play and what units can do. The same player can play several times in a row or execute glorious feats at the price of increased risks, or use a more cautions approach to moving his army. This unforeseen game mechanic sets a new vision in fantasy gaming strategies.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "A combination edition published by Marks &amp; Spencers, to sell exclusively in their stores.&#10;&#10;Blankety Blank is a board game based on the UK BBC TV quiz show of the same name first introduced by Terry Wogan in 1977, itself based on the 1970's version of the US Game Show Match Game.&#10;&#10;The game simply involves guessing the missing &quot;blank&quot; in a sentence. The sentence itself often gives an innocuous clue to the blank. Players then compare answers and score points for matching answers.&#10;&#10;One player acts as quizmaster and the other players take turns to be a &quot;contestant&quot; and a &quot;panelist.&quot; The quizmaster decides who the first contestant is going to be the first question is read out and the contestant and panelists write their answers on the sheet provided.&#10;&#10;When everyone has recorded their answer, the contestant reads out his answer first, followed by each panelist in turn. Each time that the answer of the contestant matches that of the panelist the contestant gets a point.&#10;&#10;The two contestants with the highest number of points then go on to play the &quot;Super Match Game.&quot; In this game there are three possible answers to each question--the answers are worth 50 points, 100 points or 150 points. When a player matches any of these answers, they record the number of points won. The player with the most points at the end of the Super Match is the winner and goes on to the Head to Head game, the last round.&#10;&#10;In The Price Is Right, one player acts as host to set up the puzzles and verify correct answers. The other players make bids on prizes. The player who bids closest without going over plays a pricing game against the house for more prizes. (The television series rotates over seventy different games. Some home game editions contains as many as forty-five games; some as few as six.)&#10;&#10;The finale is called the Showcase Round. The two players involved may be the players with the highest scores or it may be the players who won their respective Showcase Showdowns. (It depends on the edition of the game.) Each player has three prizes. Each guesses what the total value of one's own three prizes is. The person who guesses closer without going over is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

The scale of the rules is designed for fighting the larger battles of antiquity, where armies would number 25,000 men or more, on an average sized table.&#10;&#10;Missile and melee combat has been designed to reflect the fatigue and decline in fighting ability during the course of the battle.  While it is possible to defeat an opposing force with missile fire it will take quite a while compared to engaging in melee.  As troops take casualties, their morale will decline with one side usually routing from the field while the victor will usually only have a few losses.&#10;&#10;As for battlefield tactics, one thing you will find is that using multiple lines and a reserve, though creating a narrower front, will have an advantage over an army arrayed in a single battle line with no reserve.  Attacking with fresh troops against fatigued enemies will usually result in victory for the army with the fresh troops.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

On a player's turn, they use their units to attack other players' positions, hopefully with superior numbers. Combat is a simple dice rolling affair that stresses attrition, and reinforcements are given to players who collect sets of cards.&#10;&#10;Careers is a game where the players set their own victory conditions. A player may choose to pursue Fame, Happiness, Money, or a combination of all three. The limitation being that the total number of &quot;points&quot; earned in the 3 categories must total 60. eg. 60 Happiness, 0 Fame, 0 Money; 20 of each; or any other combination. The players endeavor to fulfill their goal by going through any number of different &quot;occupation paths&quot;. All paths have some prerequisite for entry, and benefits accrue from going through any of the paths more than once. The different occupations are designed to be suited to different strategies, eg. Hollywood is good for fame points, while &quot;Going to Sea&quot; is good for happiness. In the end it is the player (or team of players) who gets to their pre-set goal first who will be the winner, and achieve everything they ever wanted in life.&#10;&#10;",

Each player receives 12 pieces. Each piece has two different sides: 4x Smiling/Neutral, 4x Frowing/Neutral, 3x Smiling/Frowning, 1x Neutral/Neutral. The players move the pieces on the board; when a piece moves into another piece's space, the pieces are flipped and compared. The weakest piece is removed: Smiling defeats all others and Neutral defeats Frowning. Play continues until only three pieces remain. The player that has the most pieces left, wins the game.&#10;&#10;Resources: Players have 24 two-color pieces, which they use to make combinations. The player that makes the most combinations, wins the game.&#10;&#10;Six hats: Cards are drawn indicating a riddle. Players have to determine the correct hat color.

        "description": "M&uuml;ckenstich is a trick-taking card game with four suits, with each suit having cards numbered 1-12 (with two 12s) and three mosquitoes; a mosquito has no number but is the highest card in a suit.&#10;&#10;Each round, players start with a number of cards in hand, then discard two of those cards face down. For the most part, M&uuml;ckenstich follows traditional trick-taking rules. The active player lays down a card, then each other player follows by playing a single card, following suit, if possible. Whenever a mosquito is played, that player declares one color to be trump. (The game starts with no trump color.) A mosquito or 12 played later in the round is considered higher than one played earlier. Once all players have laid down a card, the highest trump card (if any) wins the trick; with no trump, the highest card in the suit led for the round wins the trick. Players keep track of tricks won, and the winner of a trick leads to the next trick.&#10;&#10;Once all tricks have been played, the single player with the fewest tricks names one suit to count double during scoring, then the single player with the most mosquitoes names one of the three remaining suits to be worthless. Then players tally their points: The first mosquito in a suit is worth -5 points, while all other mosquitos are worth 0. Suited cards are worth 0-2 depending on whether they are worthless, scored as normal, or doubled.&#10;&#10;After a number of rounds equal to the number of players (or twice as many rounds with three players), the player with the highest total score wins.&#10;&#10;&#10;In Danger, players draw numbered and colored cards, trying to collect as many points as possible in each color each round without exceeding the limit of 15 points.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player draws the top card from the deck and places it in front of her in a row for cards of that color; some cards are multicolor, and the player chooses in which row to play these cards. After laying a second card in the round, a player has the option of securing a row at the end of each turn. To secure a row, the player must not have the lowest total in that color when compared to the other players; the player secures a row by turning the last card in that row 90&ordm;. A player can secure only one row each turn.&#10;&#10;If a player exceeds a total of 15 points in a row, that row is now blocked and worth 0 points; the player turns those cards face-down.&#10;&#10;If a player draws a colored card for a row either secured or blocked, she must discard the card. The next player in turn order has the option of taking this discarded card instead of drawing randomly from the deck.&#10;&#10;Once the fourth row of any player is secured or blocked, the round ends immediately. Whoever has the fewest points in a color (with blocked rows worth 0 points) scores nothing for this color; all other players score points equal to the numbers showing in this color in their row. Players then empty their rows and continue playing with the cards remaining in the deck. After five complete rounds, the player with the highest total score wins.&#10;&#10;&#10;Zwickern is a public-domain card game of the fishing variety, in which the game starts with a pool of cards on the table and players try to claim these cards for points by using the cards in their hands. Most cards have a single number in the corner to show their value when being played, while some cards have two numbers (e.g., 2/12) and cards like these can be either value when played or when lying on the table; each card also has a victory point value.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player plays one card from her hand and either:&#10;&#10;    Buys cards from the display (using an 8, for example, to buy a 5 and 3, or an 8, or all three cards)&#10;    Builds a pile of cards (by adding or subtracting the card played with a card or pile already on the table, or vice versa)&#10;    Plays to the table (making the card available for piles or buys on future turns)&#10;&#10;&#10;After players play out the few cards in their hand, they receive a few more cards. After a certain number of rounds, the game ends and players sum the points of the cards they've collected, earning additional points for collecting the most cards and for buying all cards on display during a turn. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In Scrabble, players use their seven drawn letter-tiles to form words on the gameboard. Each word laid out earns points based on the commonality of the letters used, with certain board spaces giving bonuses. But a word can only be played if it uses at least one already-played tile or adds to an already-played word. This leads to slightly tactical play, as potential words are rejected because they would give an opponent too much access to the better bonus spaces.&#10;&#10;In Clue, players move from room to room in a mansion to solve the mystery of: who done it, with what, and where? Players are dealt character, weapon, and location cards after the top card from each card type is secretly placed in the confidential file in the middle of the board. Players must move to a room and then make an accusation against a character saying they did it in that room with a specific weapon. The player to the left must show one of any cards accused to the accuser if in that player's hand. Through deductive reasoning each player must figure out which character, weapon, and location are in the secret file. To do this, each player must uncover what cards are in other players hands by making more and more accusations. Once a player knows what cards the other players are holding they will know what cards are in the secret file. A great game for those who enjoy reasoning and thinking things out.&#10;&#10;In Sorry!, players race their four game pieces from Start around the board to Home. By turning over a card from the draw deck and following its instructions, players move their pieces around the game board, switch places with players, and knock opponents' pieces off the track and back to their Start position.&#10;&#10;Yahtzee is a classic dice game played with 5 dice. Each player's turn consists of rolling the dice up to 3 times in hope of making 1 of 13 categories. Examples of categories are 3 of a kind, 4 of a kind, straight, full house, etc. Each player tries to fill in a score for each category, but this is not always possible. When all players have entered a score or a zero for all 13 categories, the game ends and total scores are compared.&#10;&#10;",

This game is tiny (in its simplest form the game consists of 2 cards and a dollar's worth of pocket change).&#10;&#10;In this game, each player takes on the role of one of over 30 different bosses. Each boss has its own unique combination of monsters that it can summon and/or spells that it can cast. In this game, all of the monsters are represented by coins. Pennies are the smallest monsters, nickels are bigger, dimes are bigger still, and quarters are the most powerful monsters that can be summoned.&#10;&#10;To begin the game, each player selects a boss card to use and takes 3 pennies as starting monsters. The game consists of 5 rounds. On each round, players will simultaneously place their coins. They can create new monster and/or cast spells by placing coins on their boss card. They can attack other players by placing coins face-up next to their boss card or defend by placing coins tails-up next to boss card. At the end of the 5th round, each player adds up the points for his/her monsters (pennies are worth 1 point each, bigger monsters are worth more). The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;There are over 5 different modes of play. Some modes (free expansion rules) will accommodate 3, or 4 players.

        "description": "Kamara is code-matching strategy game for two to eight players. You play the role of a spirit, or diwa, attempting to influence someone within the chamber of their mind. Each diwa has a different color that evokes a different emotion.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to alter the game tiles to match the yellow kamara card you possess. Each time you do so, you gain that card. The first player to match three yellow kamara cards wins.&#10;&#10;SETUP:&#10;1. Each player draws a yellow card. Then, the elder takes the first turn. That player may choose any tile they&rsquo;d like to place down, followed by the player on his or her left. Lay out the tiles one by one to form the chamber. All yellow border edges must form a square when the chamber is complete.&#10;2. After the last tile has been placed by a player, the player on his or her right chooses a  unique player pawn, or diwa, to represent themselves. After choosing a diwa, place the diwa in the chamber onto a square in any tile that possesses a paltik. A diwa may not be placed onto a paltik.&#10;3. Shuffle the two decks, then place them beside the chamber.&#10;&#10;PLAYING THE GAME:&#10;The player that placed the last diwa will take the first turn. Each turn has two parts:&#10;&bull; Draw a yellow card if you do not have one.&#10;&bull; Use up to five actions.&#10;1. Draw a yellow card if you do not have one. If no cards are available when you attempt to draw, the game ends. The players with the most yellow cards matched wins the game.&#10;2. Use up to five actions. You may do any of these actions multiple times in a turn, or use less than five actions.&#10;&#10;ACTIONS&#10;Exchange: If you possess a yellow card, once per turn you may recycle it and draw another yellow card.&#10;Flip: If you are on a paltik, you may flip the tile you are on. When you do so, draw a green card if you do not already possess one or have drawn one this turn. Players on the flipped tile remain in the same squares. The border stays intact.&#10;Match: If you are standing on the tapos, you may match your yellow card if the chamber&rsquo;s paltiks match your card by setting it aside. The Kamara logo on the yellow card and center tile will be your reference.&#10;Move: Move from one square to another adjacent square. You may move diagonal only if the move occurs on the same tile. You may not move through thick lines or dark brown blocks. You may not end your movement on top of another player&rsquo;s diwa.&#10;Play: If you possess a green card, you may recycle it. You may use its effect or ignore it.&#10;Poke: If you are adjacent to another diwa, you may move that diwa to another square adjacent to you without passing through thick lines or landing on another diwa.&#10;Port: If you are standing on a tapos, you may move your diwa to another tapos.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Conan, designed by Fred Henry and based on the Conan universe by Robert E. Howard, is a scenario-based semi-cooperative asymmetric miniatures board game. One player is the Overlord, playing the opposition forces, and the other players (1 to 4) play Conan and his companions: Shevatas the thief, Hadrathus the Priest/Sorcerer, Belit the pirate queen, Valeria the warrior, etc. The game is based purely on Robert E. Howard's novels and short stories (and not the movies or other non-Howardian material). The publisher has hired Patrice Louinet, a Howard expert, to make sure the art and the scenarios are compatible with Howard's vision.&#10;&#10;Each game is a scenario, played on a map. There are 4 maps included in the retail copy of the game, and each map can have several scenarios set on it. The game is fast, one hour approximately. It's possible to play several scenarios in a campaign, but you can also play each scenario individually. There are 9 scenarios in the base box.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of a scenario, players choose their team (Conan and two or three other heroes). The Overlord gathers all the miniatures (picts, Necromancer, skeleton warriors, monsters, etc.), tokens, and cards from the chosen scenario. The game usually plays in a limited number of turns (ten, for instance). Each scenario can have very different objectives: find the princess captured by picts and hidden in a hut and leave the camp before the pict hunters return; find the magical key to open a sealed door, steal the jewel and leave; kill the Necromancer by the end of turn 10; survive by the end of turn 10; escape the prison; etc.&#10;&#10;During their turn, the heroes can activate or rest. If they activate, they can spend &quot;gems&quot; from their energy pool to do all sorts of actions: move, fight (melee or distance), defend, pick a lock, reroll, etc. If they rest, they can move a lot of gems from their &quot;spent&quot; pool box to their &quot;available&quot; pool box. When they take an action, they throw a number of dice equal to the number of gems they put in their action. There are three different kinds of dice: yellow (the weaker dice), orange (medium) and red (strong). Each character has a color based on their specialty: Conan throws red dice in combat while the Sorcerer throws yellow dice in combat; the thief throws red dice in Manipulation actions, while Conan throws orange dice; etc. Each player can have equipment cards (armor, magic potions, weapons, etc.) which give them bonuses on their dice rolls.&#10;&#10;The Overlord plays differently. He uses a board with eight slidable tiles, plus his own Energy gems. Each tile corresponds to one unit (1 to 3 miniatures) on the game mat, and all of the miniature abilities are written on this tile (movement, armor, attack, special abilities). The tile position on the board corresponds to the numbers 1-8. The Overlord has a pool of energy gems and each time he activates one unit, he needs to spend a number of gems matching the tile placement: tile#1 costs 1 energy gem, tile#2 costs 2 gems, etc. Whatever tile the Overlord chooses to activate, he spends the corresponding energy cost (moving his energy gems from the available pool to the spent pool), then takes the tile out and moves it to the end of the sliding track: If he wants to activate this unit again, it will cost him 8 gems, because the unit is now on position 8. The Overlord can activate a maximum of two tiles, and he regains only a certain number of gems each turn (depending on the scenario).&#10;&#10;In a typical scenario, the heroes need to accomplish something and the Overlord wins if the heroes fail to reach their objective &mdash; but in some scenarios, the Overlord has his own objectives and the Heroes win if they prevent him from accomplishing his goal.&#10;&#10;",

The opening hand is 4x1, 4x2, 4x3, 3x3, 2x5, 1x7, which is enough to get you only halfway around the circuit. If the space you move to is occupied by other cyclists, you gain a jump move of the card you played multiplied by the number of other cyclists in the space. You only get a bonus move from the first space you move to.&#10;&#10;And that&rsquo;s it! There are 2 sprint lines at one and two thirds distances, and 2 special spaces (miss your next turn, exchange your hand for a set from the replacement deck, which can re-energise a cyclist who&rsquo;s burnt his best cards) but the beauty of the game is in the movement mechanism. Because of the necessity to get bonus moves every turn you have to stay with the pack while using mid-value cards. Usually there&rsquo;s a few turns of this, then there&rsquo;s a slight increase in speed and suddenly someone is playing their 7 card to try to get back to the pack.&#10;&#10;",

But the gold will be scarce and the expeditions will get poorer with each turn, making it harder to get to the center of the lake.&#10;&#10;The game ends if one of two conditions is met: either a player reaches the center tile of the lake, or a player enters bankruptcy. Points are scored for having the most camps, for having machinery still working, for the explored area and for remaining gold.&#10;&#10;This is a game of economical scarcity, and where every piece of gold counts.&#10;&#10;",

It includes the historical Japanese Indian Ocean Raid, but also examines other hypothetical options, in the period from April to November 1942. One player commands the Allied (largely Commonwealth) forces and the other the Japanese. Victory is obtained by destroying the opposing fleets, bombarding ports or airfields, interfering with merchant shipping, and possibly even supporting amphibious invasions or decoy operations.&#10;&#10;Based on the system of the prize-winning  Solomon Sea, Bay of Bengal is a double blind 2-player game, which means each player moves his task forces, air strikes, and search planes on his own map, and tells the other player about the hexes he searches. Combat is resolved by a series of dice rolls. Each hex represents a diameter of 100 nautical miles, with 3 hours per turn. Each counter represents 6 to 10 planes, individual carries, or groups of smaller ships. Historical chrome includes rules such as radar equipped planes for night search and strikes, rescuing of survivors, leaking battleship boilers, armoured flight decks, and the secret British naval base. Eight historical and alternate-history scenarios are included.&#10;&#10;",

From shore to shore, all owe thanks to his wondrous legacy. Now, sacred sites across the land have been defiled and plundered by the disgraced wizard Mortibris, who along with his vile undead minions will stop at nothing to obtain the secrets of Valandor&rsquo;s power. Only the bravest heroes dare oppose him. Thrown together from the far corners of the realm, they step boldly into the depths, ready to face whatever foul evil awaits them&hellip;&#10;&#10;Hero, your quest begins here!&#10;&#10;Embark on a fantasy adventure for up to five players with Dungeon Saga: Dwarf King's Quest. With highly detailed game-pieces and learn-as-you-play rules, this set contains everything you need to transform your tabletop into a deep and immersive world of heroes and monsters. Play a single game in just 30 minutes, or combine the carefully composed adventures for countless hours of classic quest gameplay. When the fate of the world hangs in the balance, which part will you play in the epic Dungeon Saga?&#10;&nbsp;&#10;-Epic, story-driven campaign&#10;-Classic quest atmosphere&#10;-Easy rules you can learn as you play&#10;-Characters that develop as the adventure unfolds&#10;-Beautifully illustrated 3D dungeons with doors, barrels, bookcases and more!&#10;-26 detailed and fully assembled miniatures in coloured plastic&#10;-Evocative &lsquo;ancient tome&rsquo; packaging in a protective sleeve&#10;&#10;One player takes the part of the evil dungeon overlord with the forces of evil at his command, and the others divide the mighty heroes between them.&nbsp;Each hero has strengths and weaknesses and teamwork is the key: The mighty barbarian can slaughter many foes at a time, yet he is lightly armoured and vulnerable to strong enemies. The Dwarf, on the other hand, is steadier as his thick armour can resist most attacks. The Elf is not as skilled a fighter as either of these, instead preferring to stay at a distance where her finely-honed archery skills can best be used. Finally, there is the wizard -the others may laugh at his lack of fighting skill, yet it is often his magic that carries the day. If the others can keep him alive, that is.&#10;&#10;This core set will be supported with a raft of expansion products as time goes on, adding new challenges and game modes to your Dungeon Saga. The first of these will be Adventurer's Companion which will add an AI system for solo and fully co-operative play, the ability to create unique characters from scratch using any model in your collection, the tools you need to design your own dungeons and much more!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Be sure to see &quot;Community Wiki&quot; towards the bottom for file links and details.&#10;&#10;FLAC (Fast Large Air Combats) is a free set of rules designed for a fast paced, action packed, hex-based, WW2 air combat game using  any scale of miniatures (1:200, 1:144 or 1:100 scale work best) where a single player can control a multiple number of aircraft. The only limitation is the size of the game mat and the number of aircraft models you have. For beginners, we recommend no more than 2-3 aircraft per player, and no more than six to eight players per game.&#10;&#10;By design, FLAC is fairly abstract, but that is only because it is designed to capture the flavor of air combat rather than overwhelm the players with lots of detailed characteristics of air combat. For example, there are only six altitude levels in FLAC, which is a fraction of what it should be, but trying to keep track of a vast array of altitudes can be tedious. Also, it would not make for fast, fun game play because aircraft at very different altitudes do not interact well. Overall, FLAC is designed to capture the flavor of air combat in a simple, fast, and enjoyable way.&#10;&#10;",

Napoleon wanted to save as many men as possible for his main fight against the Allied forces so the Prussian player earns victory points based on how many of Napoleon's troops are activated.&#10;&#10;",

When one player has rid himself of all of the cards (quests) in his hand, or when a certain period of time has passed (when you've drawn four special cards from the draw deck), that round ends. The player who rid himself of cards gets closer to the High Heavens, but those with cards remaining are pushed away even further.&#10;&#10;The gods can also use their faithful servants for their own purposes. They can help their masters to do away with surplus quests, or cause trouble for the other gods by imposing more quests on them. However, take care when you do this because all such acts remain in memory as bad karma. If you manage to complete all of your quests, your accumulated bad karma will be ignored, but if you fail and have quests remaining, they will become a heavy burden.&#10;&#10;You will need to determine when to silently do your chores and when to use your servants to increase your chances of success.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The War of Ashes is not a war of front lines and set piece battles. Small groups encounter each other in every manner, and there can be neither truce nor quarter. Scouts and foraging parties, messengers, guards, and lost soldiers meet. They fight over a cache of food, a lost animal, a footbridge, a message, or just to get back home. These desperate skirmishes take place amongst camps and baggage, in ravines, at the edge of swamps, or on the decks of small ships. There is no warning and no time to call for help. These small battles that will never be named or recorded are decided by the choices and skill of a handful of fighters, and in turn these skirmishes decide the course of the war.&#10;&#10;Shieldbash is the skirmish wargame for the War of Ashes setting.  The fights are very flavorful, with ships that move beneath you as you fight on their decks, cavalry, darkness, archers, musicians, berserkers, carnivorous plants, and lumbering trolls.&#10;&#10;Two new races of Agaptus are introduced in Shieldbash: the lizard-like Ki-Kak seeking vengeance on the Vidaar, and the True Atronians, does from the Elvorix, Vidaar, and Jaarl people who fight to unify their peoples against the Kuld menace.&#10;&#10;A blind activation system leaves the commander unsure of how far he can push his fighters before the momentum of battle changes. Shieldbash concentrates on a commander's ability to use his fighters to best effect. Designed for ease of play, commanders can fight several skirmishes in an evening, following the tale of their warbands as they grow in power and renown. Gather your fighters, plan your attack, and fight for your people. Lead with your sword, keeping an eye open for the errant Shieldbash!&#10;&#10;",

However, you don't want any of the white colored jewels, as they are worthless and will never score.&#10;&#10;(Setup) From Box Top:&#10;Put all of the jewels into a global stash to one side of the playing area. Give each player a Persian Rug. Choose one player to be the first Sultan. Give that player the Sultan pawn, the Sultan cards, and the dice.&#10;&#10;(Play) Summarized From the Box Top:&#10;The Sultan, using the dice, adds 10 jewels of the rolled color into a single pile for that round. The Sultan then divides the pile in any manner they choose among each of the players, so long as each player pile contains at least one item. Finally the sultan secretly determines which color will score at the end of the given round using the Sultan cards. The position of the Sultan then passes to the next player, and play continues until all jewels have been dispersed and final scoring occurs.&#10;&#10;",

The spinner then gets asked 3 questions, each one harder than the last. For each one they get right, they get money out of the pot corresponding to the amount shown on the card for the question. If they get it wrong, they pay the amount shown on the card to the pot. When the pot is empty, the game is over. The most dollars at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

Massive sailing warships, armies of bayonet-wielding soldiers, and their skilled allies fought for control of North American, African, and Indian colonies. In many ways, this was the first &quot;world war&quot;.&#10;&#10;In 1750: Britain vs. France, you play as Britain or France, wielding your forces to decide the outcome of this struggle. During the game, you recruit generals and admirals from the Seven Years' War (French and Indian War) and the War of the Austrian Succession, and send other military forces to take colonies by force, with colonies producing exports to aid your economy. Your units roll dice in combat against enemy forces, and you can modify those results by playing historic event cards to turn the tide of battle, modifying dice rolls and destroying enemy cards at critical moments. You'll also engage in political efforts to persuade other world powers to enter the conflict on your side and bring their resources to the fight.&#10;&#10;Your final score is decided by the number of colonies you have captured, countries you have gotten to join your cause, and enemy leaders you've taken as prisoners. Will you change history, or will history repeat itself?&#10;&#10;",
