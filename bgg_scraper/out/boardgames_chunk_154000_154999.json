        "description": "Pagoda is a two-player only game in which players compete to build multiple layers of up to six pagodas. Each player has five face-up and two face-down colored cards, and they use these cards to build colored pillars and levels of the pagoda. Once a pillar has been placed on the ground floor, all other pillars placed must be of the same color. When someone places the fourth pillar on a level, he places a floor tile of the pillars' color on top, with this tile have colored dots to indicate which color of pillar can be placed on top.&#10;&#10;Players score points each time they place a pillar, with a pillar on ground level being worth one point, a pillar on the second floor two points, and so on. When a player places a floor tile, he gains one point as well as two actions associated with that color on his individual action board. The fourth floor tile is placed upside-down to show only one colored dot. Two pillars can be placed on this dot, each worth five points, and once placed the pagoda is finished. After three pagodas are finished, players finish the round, then the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

In round 1, almost any kind of clue is allowed, and the cluegiver cannot pass on a card. In round 2, no more than one word can be used in each clue (but unlimited sounds and gestures are permitted); the cluegiver can pass on any card he likes, and the teammates can give only a single answer. In round 3, the cluegiver can use no words at all and can pass as often as he likes; again, teammates are allowed only a single guess. Give good physical clues in round 1, and they'll pay dividends down the road when you need to keep your mouth shut and gesture like a maniac before time's up!&#10;&#10;Time's Up!

Players take turns asking questions, with a point being subtracted for each question. Players are awarded points for asking certain key questions that eliminate faux versions of the story. The list of useful key questions is attached to every riddle. This sort of gaming procedure effectively encourages players to develop careful analytical questions and eliminates random questions.&#10;&#10;",

Players take turns asking questions, with a point being subtracted for each question. Players are awarded points for asking certain key questions that eliminate faux versions of the story. The list of useful key questions is attached to every riddle. This sort of gaming procedure effectively encourages players to develop careful analytical questions and eliminates random questions.&#10;&#10;",

If a coin lands entirely within a bed (that is, without touching a horizontal line), he scores a point. Points are scored after each flick, so earlier coins may score multiple times, as long as they bumped into another bed. After his turn, the four coins are removed from the board and the game proceeds with the next player.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to score three points in each of the five beds. If a player lands a coin in a completed bed (where he already has three points), a point is awarded to his opponent instead. The winner is the first player to score fifteen points.&#10;&#10;",

Each turn, the players draw 3 cards and each choose 1 from the other player's hand before discarding and drawing another 3 cards. Should a Peasant be revealed, nothing happens. Should a Guard show his face, your opponent gets to reveal an additional card from your hand for that turn. Should the Rogue be revealed, you win. This was designed as a very quick, as well as easy to learn, mini-game.&#10;&#10;One final mechanic worth mentioning: should a player have their Rogue card in hand and it is not revealed that turn, both decks and discard piles are reshuffled and their opponent removes one of their Peasants from their deck.&#10;&#10;",

In a delicate balance of resource management and area control, players must plan their building strategies while carefully managing their supply tracks to refine the right resources at the most opportune times. Stay a step ahead of the competition and you could lead the West into the Golden Age.&#10;&#10;The goal of Gold West is to accumulate the most victory points through clever management of your growing mining empire. There are five resources in the game: the metals Copper, Silver, and Gold are used to acquire victory points in a variety of ways, while Timber and Stone are building materials used to build camps and settlements on the board to collect more resources and influence the landscape.&#10;&#10;Each hex contains either two or three resources. Gold generally earns players the most points, with silver and copper yielding slightly less. In addition, each terrain type scores points for the player with the most influence therein at the end of the game. Copper terrains are the most valuable, with Silver, Gold, and Forest Terrains earning slightly fewer points.&#10;&#10;When gaining new metals and materials, players place them in their &quot;supply track&quot;, a mancala-style track in which you will manage your resources. You get points the further back in the track you place them, as this creates a more refined product, but it will take longer to get these resources to the front of the supply track where they can be used. Shipping, investments, and Boomtown offices often reward players who fulfill them earlier, so it's a careful balance of risk and reward.&#10;&#10;",

You will be collecting supply cards, surviving events, and interacting with other players.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: Every player starts the game with a party leader card that grants special abilities along with 3 party members. If all 3 party members die, you lose and the game continues. In the center of the table are destination decks that every player is trying to travel to. To travel to a destination, you spend the required resources shown, acquire the card, and move on to the next destination. The player that gets the set of 2 rivers, and 3 cities, ends the game and wins after a final round if no other players collect all their destinations. Your party size is used as a tiebreaker if needed. &#10;Each player turn consists of drawing cards, playing actions (on themselves or other players), traveling to a destination, and discarding cards.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Rare card game that uses standard playing cards with the addition of 8 Royal Aces and eight Jokers. As there are two packs, this makes a total of 120 cards per game.&#10;&#10;The game is a curious mix of Rummy and Whist. Each player gets 18 cards dealt to them. There now begins a phase of drawing and discarding until a player lays down a run or set of 5 cards (5 Nines or a run of five, for example). Bonuses and penalties are then scored and every player must reduce their hand to 13 cards.&#10;&#10;Then the auction begins and one player (or team if playing partnerships) will win the auction and then need to make that many tricks as bid. Card play is exactly the same as standard games like Whist. Royal Aces secured in this phase (or Release) score sizeable bonus points.&#10;&#10;It can be seen that strategy is needed at every phase. If you use a high scoring 5 cards in the first stage (known as Release), the cards used will not be available to you for the auction and card-play in the 2nd phase.&#10;&#10;The object is to be the first player (or partnership) to score 1,000 points.&#10;&#10;",

As the ultimatum was rejected, Austria-Hungary then declared war, marking the outbreak of the war.&#10;&#10;While France and Russia immediately sided with Serbia, Germany joined the Austria-Hungary and started a surprise offensive in the west with the objective of quickly defeating the French, to then turn east and knock the Tzarist Russia out of the war.&#10;&#10;&#10;1914 is a game of World War I conflict simulation at the strategic level. It recalls the most decisive battles fought by Germany on the Western Front in 1914. Although based on historical events and battles, the players in command of the two factions can modify the evolution of World War I.&#10;&#10;The game is recommended for two or three players, but has a good solitaire suitability.&#10;&#10;Developed with a system of wooden blocks and cubes and played out over a 64x86 cm multicolor mapboard, with more than 200 wooden components painted &quot;A buratto&quot;, a technique usually adopted for painting car parts and accessories.&#10;&#10;The rules are divided into two major sections which can be learned one at a time:&#10;&#10;&bull; The Game Rules introduce the basic concepts and enable players to start playing the game without too many rules to remember.&#10;&bull; The Optional Rules are for those who want to get the most out of the game, with rules for Surprise Attack, Retreat, Marne Offensive, British Fusiliers and more.&#10;&#10;In 1914, 1 cm is approximately 27 km, a turn is 1 month long, and a full-strength counter represents a major military formation, normally corps size with some divisions.&#10;&#10;The game must be played with &quot;Fog of War&quot; on (with the faces of wooden blocks hidden from the opponent).&#10;&#10;",

Nick the bird, however, has other plans and will peck at exposed insects to send them scurrying back to the starting line.&#10;&#10;To set up, players takes two insects for a short game and three for a longer game; place the leaves into their holders and set them next to the game board so that they cover certain spaces. On a turn, a player rolls the die, then adds one of his insects to the movement track. Once all of a player's insects are on the track, he moves any one of his choice on his turn based on the die roll. If he rolls Nick, he makes the bird pick up one of the insect tokens with his beak, ideally catching one of the opponents! That player must start over with that token. Whoever reaches the end of the track with all of his insects first wins.&#10;&#10;",

In Pocket Battles: Confederacy vs Union &mdash; the fourth title in the Pocket Battles series &mdash; tiles represent troops and troops make up units in your army; just determine the size of the battle, then create your own army from a pool of existing troops. Each tile hits on certain rolls, and some can only melee while others can shoot. Some tiles also have special traits that can affect their whole unit or army.&#10;&#10;The basic rules of the game are fairly simple: Two armies face each other in battle. The armies are split into three columns and two rows. Players must decide at the start of the game how many points they will give to their armies, which then determines how many points you must defeat to win.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you choose which faction of your army to send off to battle! Attacks are made by using Order Tokens. If no Order Tokens are present on a unit, it costs just one token to issue orders to that unit. Issuing orders to the same unit in the same Battle Round costs you the number of tokens present on the unit, plus one. (If one token is on a unit, it costs two additional tokens to activate it again; with three tokens on the unit, it costs four additional tokens, etc.)&#10;&#10;After a round of battle, you may choose to redeploy your units. (Units may move from the back of the row to the front of the same row, from the back of a row to the back of another row, or from the front of a row to the front of another row). Redeployment costs no Order tokens. The battle ends when one army has eliminated at least half of the points in the opposing army.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In a formidable Indian landscape, a burgeoning marketplace is forming. Opportunities are ripe in this community of traders, bankers, moneylenders, and dealers of grains and spices. Fortune awaits the one who plans well and uses his resources wisely. Oil, silk, incense and spices are the currency used to build tents, establish settlements, and amass riches &mdash; but commerce brings competition, and the space to build is limited. When there is no more room, the player who has maximized his resources to become the most successful merchant is the victor!&#10;&#10;In Bania, players use resource cards to buy and build tents, then strategically place these tents on the board to earn points. When no legal moves remain on the board, the game ends and the player with the most points wins. On a turn, a player performs these actions in order, if possible:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Collect your bonus: If your elephant marker sits on a tent tile on the board, collect one resource card of each type in the settlement where the marker is located.&#10;    Buy and place tent tiles OR roll for resources: As explained below.&#10;    Place your elephant marker: If your elephant marker isn't on the board and you placed tent tiles that turn, place the marker on one tile you placed this turn.&#10;&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with four tent tiles and eight resource cards: two of each type (oil, spice, silk and incense); one side of the tent tiles shows one of these four resources, while the other side shows three resource symbols (e.g., two spice and one silk). If you want more resources, you can roll the four dice up to three times, locking any dice that you wish while doing so. When you stop rolling, you receive one resource card for each resource symbol showing; in addition, if you have both a front and back half of an elephant showing on the dice, then you receive an elephant marker bonus as at the start of your turn.&#10;&#10;If you have the right cards in hand, you might instead choose to buy and place tents; if you have twelve or more cards, then you must do so. A tent costs three resource cards matching the three resource symbols on the back and you pay this cost after placing a tent on the game board, but if you place a tent adjacent to other tents, then the cost is discounted based on the colors of adjacent tents, possibly allowing you to place a tent for no cost at all! When you place a tent on its own to start a settlement, you receive 3 points; for all other tents placed, you receive 1 point each. You refill your hand to four tent tiles at the end of your turn &mdash; but if you've placed all four, you can immediately draw four new tiles and keep building!&#10;&#10;A settlement can have at most seven tents in it; when someone places the seventh tent, any elephant markers in the settlement are removed and returned to their owners. The game ends when no more tents can be placed. Whoever placed the final tile scores 3 points, and whoever has the most of each type of resource card scores 2 points. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Settlers from four major powers of the world have discovered new lands, with new resources and opportunities. Romans, Barbarians, Egyptians and Japanese all at once move there to expand the boundaries of their empires. They build new buildings to strengthen their economy, they found mines and fields to gather resources, and they build barracks and training grounds to train soldiers. Soon after they discover that this land is far too small for everybody, then the war begins...&#10;&#10;Imperial Settlers is a card game that lets players lead one of the four factions and build empires by placing buildings, then sending workers to those buildings to acquire new resources and abilities. The game is played over five rounds during which players take various actions in order to explore new lands, build buildings, trade resources, conquer enemies, and thus score victory points.&#10;&#10;The core mechanism of Imperial Settlers is based on concepts from the author's card game 51st State.&#10;&#10;",

It's up to the player to make the most out of their unique abilities and slay the opposition; gaining the means to secure your home territories and win the game.&#10;&#10;- A typically round consists of 3 phases, namely:&#10;&#10;The Recruitment Phase, in which both players choose a unit to recruit and forge them the kind of weapon or spell the player thinks will be the most useful, given the success of their Recruitment Roll. Choose wisely - you can never recruit two rounds in a row.&#10;&#10;The Activation Phase is where most of a action takes place. Move and attack with any units you can with the hopes of slaying an enemy unit and receive it's bounty of 1 coin. Or, if the unit is already carrying a coin it's a race straight back to it's home square, where it can lock it down and finalise their role in the game.&#10;&#10;The Purchase Phase simply lays down the opportunity to gain the upper hand via the purchase of an upgrade.

This means games will always be different since the strengths and weaknesses are randomized at the start of every game.&#10;&#10;A winner is declared when all of the opponent's ships are destroyed. Different scenarios offer different win conditions, such as whoever earns the most victory points after 5 rounds or who can capture the mine first.&#10;&#10;The game is also unique because of the pieces. The ships are hand-made out of wood in a tiny workshop in the USA., assembled by the one-man-team known as Alexander Shen. Because they&rsquo;re made of wood, they are also completely open to endless customization op-tions.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Ready to start exploring a previously uncharted island? Good! You and the other players each have a team of five scientists, and you want to capture animal species so that you can study them &mdash; and, of course, score points.&#10;&#10;The game board in La Isla consists of a set of oddly-shaped tiles that are placed in a circular arrangement around a central polygonal tile. Thirty-five animal tokens (seven each of five types) are placed at random on spaces numbered 2, 3 and 4 on the game board; these numbers equal the number of camps that surround these spaces.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player has three cards that he places face-down in the A, B and D spaces on his card display. All players reveal their A cards at the same time, then place them in one of the three slots at the top of their display; the image depicted on the top of this card shows the special power that the owner of this card has available. Once a player has filled all three slots on her display, future cards placed with the A action cover an existing card.&#10;&#10;After revealing the cards in their B slots simultaneously, the players collect the goods depicted in the lower-left corner of their individual card.&#10;&#10;Each player in turn then places one of his scientists on a camp, first paying two resources of the type matching that camp. (If all of a player's scientists are on the board, she moves one of these scientists.) If the player now has a scientist on each camp surrounding an animal space, she takes that animal tile, scoring points for it as noted on the board (4, 3 or 2 points).&#10;&#10;Finally, the card in the D slot increases the value of one animal. You (and only you!) immediately score one point per animal of the type you moved up on the scale. If you don't have an animal of that type you don't get any points. Each animal has a points threshold so that if you move an animal up, say, four times, each animal of this type is worth an extra point at the end of the game. The scale goes up to five so that every animal can be worth up five points at the end of the game. When the sum of these values for all five animals equals seven, nine or eleven (based on the number of players), the game ends at the conclusion of the round. Players then tally their final scores to see who wins.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Sergeant Major is a trick-taking traditional card game for 3 players using a standard 52 card deck. It takes its name from its popularity among members of Britain's Royal Air Force.&#10;&#10;Multiple variations of the game exist. The two most common are the 9-5-2 (also known as the Canadian version) and the 8-5-3 (the British, Indian and Near-East Version).&#10;&#10;8-5-3 version:&#10;As per http://www.pagat.com/whist/sergeant.html&#10;&#10;Object of the Game&#10;The aim is to win as many tricks as possible. If a player succeeds in winning 12 or more tricks in one hand, the game ends and that player wins.&#10;&#10;Deal and Card Exchange (first hand)&#10;The first dealer is chosen at random. The cards are shuffled, cut and then dealt singly, 16 to each player. The last four undealt cards are placed face down on the table to form a kitty. The dealer names a suit as trumps (clubs, spades, hearts or diamonds - &quot;no trump&quot; is not allowed), discards any four cards face down, and takes the four undealt cards from the kitty in their place.&#10;&#10;The Play&#10;The player to dealer's left leads any card to the first trick. It is compulsory to follow suit if able to; a player holding no card of the suit led may play any card. Each trick is won by the highest trump it contains, or if there are no trumps in it, by the highest card of the suit led. The winner of each trick leads to the next.&#10;&#10;Targets and Scoring&#10;Each player has a target. The dealer's target is 8 tricks; the player to dealer's left has a target of 5 tricks; and the player to dealer's right needs 3 tricks. A player who won more tricks than the target is said to be up by the number of tricks won in excess of target. A player who failed to reach the target is down by the number of tricks short. The player(s) who are down pay one stake per trick short of target, and the player(s) who are up receive one stake per overtrick.&#10;&#10;Deal and Exchange (second and subsequent hands)&#10;The turn to deal rotates clockwise, so the new dealer is the player who led to the first trick previous hand. The pack is shuffled and cut and 16 cards each are dealt singly as before.&#10;&#10;Now each player who was up on the previous hand gives away one unwanted card per overtrick to a player who was down, and that player must return the highest card(s) held of the same suit(s). The exact procedure is as follows:&#10;&#10;If just one player was up, that player gives each of the other players as many unwanted cards face down as they had undertricks. These cards are all given simultaneously. The other players add these cards to their hands, and for each card received, they give back face down their highest card of that suit. A player who has no other cards of the suit received will of course have to give back the same card.&#10;    If two players were up, the player with the higher target for the hand about to be played trades first. This player gives (face down) as many cards as he or she had overtricks to the player who was down, and that player gives back face down the highest card(s) held in the same suit(s). After that, the other player who was up gives a card per overtrick to the player who was down, and receives in exchange that player's highest card(s) in the same suit(s).&#10;&#10;After this exchange of cards is complete, the dealer names trumps, discards four cards and takes the four undealt cards. If the dealer was down and had to give away the highest card of a suit, but then picks up one or more higher cards of that same suit from the undealt cards, any such high cards must be shown privately to the player(s) who traded cards in that suit.&#10;&#10;The play and scoring then proceeds as described above. The targets are always 8 tricks for the current dealer, 5 for the player who leads to the first trick, and 3 for the other player.&#10;&#10;End of the Game&#10;The game ends when any player succeeds in winning 12 or more tricks in one hand, thereby winning the game.&#10;&#10;9-5-2 version:&#10;The game is identical to 8-5-3 apart from the following:&#10;&#10;    The targets for the three players are:&#10;        Dealer - 9 tricks&#10;        Player to dealer's left - 5 tricks&#10;        Player to dealer's right - 2 tricks.&#10; After trading cards and choosing trump, the dealer picks up the four kitty cards before discarding four.&#10;&#10;If the the actual dealer was down by 3 tricks or more in the previous turn and gives 3 of his highest cards accordingly, he may look at the kitty before choosing trump.&#10;&#10;A cumulative score for each player is kept on paper. The score for each hand is assessed based on whether the required number of tricks were taken (zero score), more tricks were taken (plus score of number of tricks over required tricks) or fewer tricks (minus score of number of tricks under required tricks). Scores are totalled with the score from previous hands, and the total score of all three players should always be zero.&#10;&#10;9-5-2 is played to a target score agreed in advance, usually 10, 15, or 20 points. The game ends when someone's score reaches or exceeds the target (with that person winning) or when someone's reaches or exceeds the negative value of the target (with that person losing and ending the game).&#10;&#10;Other versions exist such as the 9-5-3 variation with no kitty (played in the Royal Navy), 6-3-8 played with 51 cards and no kitty,and the 7-4-1, a 4 players variant with its own entry in the database.&#10;&#10;",

Will you answer the call?&#10;&#10;Adventure IN! invites you and up to 4 more Adventurers to explore dungeons in the quest to find treasures and brag about your exploits!&#10;&#10;As you journey you will stumble upon Encounters, cards featuring some sort of creature or hazard.  You typically must defeat at least two in order to face the Guardian of the Treasure Horde, the ultimate Encounter!  Each time an Encounter is defeated* you level up, gaining the ability to use more powerful Treasures, such as items which heal and grant special abilities, and equipment and weapons that boost your abilities.&#10;&#10;Adventure IN is two games in one!  The base game is a quick, competitive Tournament through a randomly selected Dungeon.  The first Adventurer, or Adventurers, to reach and defeat the Dungeon Guardian will be victorious.  You may choose to cooperate at strategic points in the game, especially at the final Encounter where you may have to choose between winning with a friend or losing to your opponents.  To add variety, Adventure IN also includes a fully cooperative Campaign.  In the Campaign, you and the other players work together to try and beat a series of Dungeons.  Each Dungeon has a unique layout, usually requiring that you defeat several Encounters before facing the Dungeon Guardian.  This mode offers more strategy and depth, but also takes longer to play.&#10;&#10;The Game features multiple Dungeons, various character combinations and a large variety of Treasures and other rewards that augment character abilities.  All of this giving the game excellent replay ability!&#10;&#10;Are you ready to Adventure IN?&#10;&#10;",

Build camps and banks, smithies and harbors and control growth as your town develops!&#10;&#10;Province is a two-player game in which you must strategically manage your resources and workers to build, complete goals, and score the most victory points to win! The game features a communal worker pool representing the available workers in your town. Players move their workers to generate resources (Labor and Coin) that are used to build the various Structures, which in turn affect resource generation &mdash; but your opponent can also move the workers, leaving you without the resources you need!&#10;&#10;",

The track includes illustrations of the many picturesque towns and sights along the way, with art by Emil Ernst Heinsdorff. The game comes with six very cute painted metal player tokens.&#10;&#10;The game is simple: players roll a die and follow any instructions for the space on which they land, which are printed on the inside of the box. While the game is obviously suitable for children, some of the instructions to be followed seem equally suited to an adult drinking party. Landing on the famous statue of Lorelei, the player must sing a verse of &quot;Ich Weiss nicht, was joll es bedeuten&quot;, and if any player lands on the town of Oberwesel, everyone must immediately rise and belt out a verse from a Rhein song of their choice!&#10;&#10;The First Edition is usually dated to c. 1910, while the Second Edition (with a painting of the town of Bacharach on the box cover) dates to c. 1924.&#10;&#10;",

All playing pieces move continually in a loop.&#10;&#10;The starting position of the playing pieces is located on the inner track of the circuit, whereas the own target space can only be reached through the outer track. Change of tracks is possible by a new moving technique which is the cruical element of Samsara.&#10;&#10;Who will realize their own possibilities and take the path to their own target space by tactically and cleverly changing tracks?&#10;&#10;Game Equipment:&#10;&#10;     game board made of solid wood, treated with protective oils, 39 cm x 18 cm x 2 cm (15.4 in x 7.1 in x 0.8 in)&#10;     12 playing pieces, 2 scoring pieces&#10;     2 wooden dice&#10;&#10;&#10;Mit taktisch klugen Spurwechseln den Weg zum Zielfeld einschlagen!&#10;&#10;Im indischen Sanskrit bedeutet Samsara &bdquo;best&auml;ndiges Wandern&ldquo; und steht f&uuml;r den ewigen Kreislauf, das Rad des Lebens.&#10;&#10;Im Kreis verlaufen auch die beiden Spuren auf dem Spielbrett. Alle Spielsteine bewegen sich fortw&auml;hrend auf einer in sich geschlossenen Bahn.&#10;&#10;Die Startpositionen der Spielsteine liegen auf der inneren Spur, doch nur die &auml;u&szlig;ere Spur f&uuml;hrt zum Zielfeld. Das faszinierende Element bei Samsara ist eine neue Zugtechnik, welche den Wechsel der Spur erm&ouml;glicht.&#10;&#10;Wer erkennt die eigenen M&ouml;glichkeiten und schl&auml;gt mit taktisch geschicktem Spurwechsel den Weg zum eigenen Zielfeld ein?&#10;&#10;Spielausstattung:&#10;&#10;     Spielbrett aus massivem ge&ouml;ltem Laubholz, 39 cm x 18 cm x 2 cm&#10;     12 Spielsteine, 2 Wertungssteine&#10;     2 Holzw&uuml;rfel&#10;&#10;&#10;",

While searching the globe for solid proof of these creatures existence each Cryptozoologist can attempt to discredit their competitor&rsquo;s discoveries by leaking wild stories to the tabloid press.  Turnabout is, of course, fair play&hellip;.&#10;&#10;Basic Game Play Overview:&#10; During each turn players draw from either the Unknown (draw pile) or from the top of Tabloids (discard pile). Each player creates or adds to melds using Expedition cards in order to reach ten or more points. If ten or greater points is achieved that expedition would be considered to have found enough proof for science to take notice, thereby doubling that set's score. Also during each turn a single Anomaly card (action card) may be played which can do things like strengthen the value of an expedition in play, retrieve cards from the Tabloids, discredit other players expeditions or manipulate other facets of the game. At the end of a round, cards in the Tabloids that match expeditions in play discredit that expedition. The game also has a shut-out rule involving Extraterrestrials that, if achieved, prevents all other players from scoring that round.&#10;&#10;",

Unparalleled action And no dice.&#10;&#10;Path of Bones uses dominoes - &quot;bones&quot; - instead of dice to run its combat system. Engagements run on a two-tiered system: troops mass and press their advantage together; heroes combine their marital arts styles into devastating attacks.&#10;&#10;The rules provide an intriguing system of simultaneous attack and defense based on the two sides of the dominoes drawn by you and your opponent. Equipment and character types provide options for over forty different types of common troops. There are thousands and thousands of ways to combine the martial arts styles from the rules to make heroes ... and a guide to customizing the system to your own tastes.&#10;&#10;With the base rules you get nine combat scenarios:&#10;&#10;     One set allows a band of heroes to progress through a traditional Chinese story&#10;     Another sets the stage for fighting the Mongol Invasion of Japan&#10;     A set up for the epic climactic battle of the Forty Seven Ronin&#10;     Each combat scenario is playable as a stand-alone game, with options for replay value&#10;     Twenty-five pages of print-and-play terrain to support the scenarios right away&#10;&#10;&#10;The game plays well from as few as forty to fifty figures total (both sides) up to about five hundred. It was playtested with 25-28mm figures using standard size dominoes and 15-28mm figures using mini dominoes. Bones are used to measure movement as well as resolve combat.&#10;&#10;",

Every turn, players can rush to finish their work or sabotage those who are pursuing the same potions they are, and once you've completed a potion, you can keep it for victory points or drink it to try to get even further ahead.&#10;&#10;Every turn, players draw cards and 'transmute' a component from a pool they share with all of the other players at the table in order to produce 'elements' (earth, air, fire, water) that can then be combined to try to match the formulas at the bottom of the potion cards that act as victory points.&#10;&#10;Potions are randomized each game, so each match has its own feel - some are very directly competitive, producing potions that allow players to directly attack one another, and others require more indirection and planning. Analyzing the available potions and trying to predict the interplay between them and the value of victory points vs. the effects of the potions is a key element of play.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "FOR OFFICIAL ERRATA AND FAQ, LOOK IN THE FILES SECTION&#10;&#10;The Battle at Kemble's Cascade is a board game adaptation of a classic shoot 'em up video game. In the game, which is played out on a scrolling space backdrop, the players take on the roles of brave space pilots sweeping around in nimble yet powerful fighters, searching the asteroid clusters for universal glory and ancient technology. Players compete to obtain the most glory, with glory resulting from carrying out missions, finding lost treasure in asteroid clusters, and destroying alien entities, not to mention other players.&#10;&#10;In the game, players fly through an ever-scrolling space setting, which is represented by rows of cards. Each turn, the bottom row is removed and a new row is added to the top. Players move their spaceships and resolve effects continuously, performing actions such as collecting power-ups and money, fighting alien cruisers and titans, blocking and shooting other players, and dodging asteroids and black holes. The players need to balance the use of their ships' energy as it's used for both absorbing enemy fire and boosting their movement speed and fire rate.&#10;&#10;The game includes missions and achievements as well as a mechanism called &quot;threat level&quot; to keep everyone in suspense throughout the whole game. Threat allows players to enjoy the satisfaction of both shooting wildly at each other and dodging the hundreds of bullets raining down from enemy fighters and other players.&#10;&#10;All player ships are fully upgradeable with four different weapon classes, engines, shields and more. Each player must buy the upgrades and navigate the path that best fits his chosen strategy in order to successfully complete his missions and attain the most glory.&#10;&#10;",

Players move one space at a time and may trap opponent's pieces by blocking them on either side in a straight line.

        "description": "From pagat.com:&#10;&#10;This children's game is also commonly known as Steal the Old Man's Bundle, Steal the Old Man's Pack or Steal Pile. A very similar game is played by children in Argentina, where it is known as Casita Robada. In Italy it is known as Rubamazzo, and in Quebec it is called Paquet Voleur (literal translation of steal pile in French).&#10;&#10;Players and Cards&#10;&#10;Stealing Bundles is a fairly simple fishing game, for 2, 3 or 4 players, normally using a standard 52-card pack. To start the game, everyone draws a card and the player drawing the highest card deals first.&#10;&#10;Play&#10;&#10;The dealer shuffles, and then deals the cards out clockwise one at a time: four cards face down to each player and four face up to the centre of the table. The centre cards are laid out separately so that all are visible. The remainder of the pack is kept face down by the dealer and will be used later. The players then pick up their hands of four cards and look at them (but of course are not allowed to look at other players' cards).&#10;&#10;The player to the dealer's left starts, the turn to play passes clockwise around the table. At your turn you must play one card from your hand face up to the table. If the card you play matches the rank of any of the face up centre cards, you must take the card you played and any matched cards and place them in a face up pile in front of you, to start your 'bundle'. (Suits are ignored in this game: a King matches a King, an Eight matches an Eight, and so on.) No matter whether you matched a card or not, it is then the next player's turn to play.&#10;&#10;Any matched cards that you acquire during the game are always stacked on top of your bundle, with the card you played on top, so that only this top card is visible.&#10;&#10;If you play a card that matches the top card of an opponent's bundle, you steal their whole of their bundle and add it to the top of yours, placing the matching card that you played on top.&#10;&#10;After everyone has played their four cards, the same dealer takes the remaining undealt cards and deals another four cards face down to each player, one at a time (but no further cards to the layout). Again the players look at their hands, and play continues as before. After all these cards have been played another four cards each are dealt by the same dealer, and this process of dealing and playing continues until all the cards have been dealt and everyone has played their last four cards. At this point, any cards remaining face up in the centre are added to the bundle of the last player who matched a card.&#10;&#10;Now the cards in each are counted and whoever has the largest bundle wins.&#10;&#10;If you want to play again, the turn to deal now passes to the left. The new dealer shuffles all the cards and another game is played as described above.&#10;&#10;Casita Robada and Rubamazzo&#10;&#10;The Argentinean game Casita Robata, is essentially the same. The only differences from Stealing Bundles are:&#10;&#10;A Spanish suited pack of 40 (or 48) cards is used;&#10;    The game is played counter-clockwise.&#10;&#10;The Italian game Rubamazzo is played counter-clockwise with an Italian 40-card pack.&#10;&#10;",

Each turn players have the chance to expand their city by zoning vacant land as residential, commercial or industrial.  Money allows players to buy roads to connect their zones. Points are earned by growing your city's population and by employing them with jobs - commercial banker, farmer, forester, miner, or driller. As the population and job opportunities expand, players have the opportunity to upgrade their zones and earn money, both of which earn players even more points. Soon after the game starts, new skyscrapers begin to sprout up across the region, players' zones begin to compete for resources and space, and strategic playing becomes an engaging and critical element to each city's success!&#10;&#10;As each player's city grows, resources and purchase power becomes limited. No city can grow unchecked forever! When the resources from one sector are used up, they are gone forever. Strategic players will develop a diverse and thriving city and amass wealth, and maybe even collaborate with a neighboring city.... Game ends when all resources have been used up. Points are awarded based on number of jobs, number of skyscrapers and amount of saved money.&#10;&#10;Players will enjoy the uniqueness of every new game of CITY that they play! Change in board layout and zoning options means each game of CITY is completely different and guaranteed to be awesome!&#10;&#10;",

When opponents land on players owned property, the owning player collects rent from the landing player. Owning sets of properties increases the rent paid to the player who owns them, by the player who lands on the square. The ultimate goal is to have the most money and drive opponents into bankruptcy.&#10;&#10;The classic Monopoly with constructions and other elements from Nissan, a car company&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Drawing Blanks is a classic draw and guess featuring wildly inappropriate, unconventional, and suggestive cards.  In order to defeat the opposing team, and for lots of laughs, a player pulls a card and sketches onto the drawing surface while their teammates try to guess the outrageous, horrendous, or possibly despicable word on the card.&#10;&#10;The game winning conditions are chosen by the players to allow for a range of game lengths.  Typically a score is picked and the first team to reach that score is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;Each round consists of 60 seconds of drawing and guessing by one team, and if they are unsuccessful, the opposing team can steal the point.  If multiple teams are involved, the steal is round robin based on order of play.&#10;&#10;The deck of drawing blanks are divided into 6 color-coded categories:&#10;&#10;(RED) Fifty-Fifty: Tame or not.  Flip and find out.&#10;(GREEN) Modern Ways of Living:  Pop culture, demented &amp; minus the culture.&#10;(ORANGE) Let's Talk About Sex:  Ok, let's.&#10;(BLUE) Things That Suck:  Think of things that suck.&#10;(WHITE) If You Know What I Mean:  *wink wink*&#10;(BROWN) You People:  What do you mean &quot;you people&quot;?&#10;&#10;Included in the rulebook are several variations to the basic rules that allow expanded playability to ensure the game can be replayed again and again.  The play types include drawing as many cards as possible in a 120 second round, collecting 3 of each category, and having your opponent draw three cards and decide what you have to draw.&#10;&#10;",

Players also only have 3 pawns instead of 4 like in the original Sorry!&#10;&#10;3) The 2 card no longer entitles the player to draw another card (instead they get to place the &quot;Fire&quot; token).&#10;&#10;4) The Sorry card can be used to advance 4 spaces when no pawn can be bumped (either player drawing Sorry has no pawns in Home, or there are no opponent pawns on the main track).&#10;&#10;Contents: gameboard, 12 Sorry!

        "description": "Also includes the Game of Archery and Game of Morrice.&#10;Double Sided Game Board opens to full color Game of Quoits board on one side (11&rdquo; x 9&rdquo; x 3/4&rdquo;) and the 2 Games of Archery and Morrice on the other side.&#10;&#10;Components: 26 Round Wooden Game Pieces (9 Blue, 9 Natural, 4 Green, 4 Purple).&#10;&#10;From the rules:&#10;&#10;GAME OF ARCH&#10;&#10;Implements - Twelve men, a set of three for each player, and the Double Teetotum. The men represent and are called arrows, and are shot at the target by the proper moves. The object of the game is to see who will make the best shots with his three arrows. All moves are made by the spin of the Teetotum, using the mum of the numbers obtained by the spin, and moving an arrow aver a corresponding number of spaces. Spin for lead. The highest spin plays first. The arrows are first entered according to the spin, beginning st. and counting from the space at the flag-staff. After entering, each player, in turn, advances his arrows ac-cording to his spins, until they reach the target. Any arrow that is carried beyond the target by the spin is a miss, and counts nothing. An arrow is carried beyond the target when there are not enough spaces for it to be moved over, to use up the spin. Each ring of the target represents two spaces, one on each side sf the bull's-eye, as though the target were divided by a vertical (meat its center.&#10;&#10;The arrows are moved from the flag-staff to the target as though the whole formed one continuous line of 23 spaces-7 in the target, and 16 outside. As soon as an arrow reaches the target its move is ended. Two or more arrows of the same, or of opponent players, may 'soupy the same space at the same time. The game is ended when all the arrows have reached or missed the target. Each arrow on the outer circle counts 1; on the next ' circle, 2; on the third circle, 3; and, on the bull's-eye, 6.&#10;&#10;The player having the largest count wins the game.&#10;&#10;GAME OF MORRICE (Nine Men's Morris)&#10;&#10;Implements - Eighteen men in two colors; a set of nine for each player. The charming game of Morrice, which closely resembles, and is probably the source of &quot;Go-Bang,&quot; is the inside game, laid out in black lines, with circular spaces at the points where the lines cross or intersect each other. The object of each player is to get three of his men in a row, that is, upon the three spaces on any one of the straight black lines. All of the lines are used alike, no distinction being made between the long and the short ones. Play in turn throughout the game, and place or move but one man at a time. The players in turn, first place their men, one at a time, upon any vacant circular space, each trying to get three men in a row, and at the same time playing to prevent his opponent doing so. Thus, a player trying to form a row, will lay down two men upon the same ; but the opponent, if on the lookout, will lay down one of his men on the third space of the same line, and stop him. Sometimes players scatter their men in such a manner, that by laying down a single man, they have two ways by which they can form rows, upon their next turn, and as only one of these can be stopped by the opponent, they necessarily gain a point. Each time that a player, forms a row, he captures and removes One of his opponent's men front the board, but must, if possible, take one that will not break his rows. When all the men have been placed upon the board, one at a time, as above described, the players try to form rows by moving their men from space to space, in any direction. Sat all moves must be along the lines, always moving to the next space. As often as a player forms a row, whether in placing or moving his men, he captures one of his oppoaent's men. As soon as either player loses all but two of his men, he can form no more rows, and therefore loses the games&#10;&#10;GAME OF QUOITS&#10;&#10;Implements - Sixteen men in four colors&mdash;a set for each player, and the Double Teetotum. There are two sets of Quoit spaces, at each side of the board. The first and third players play for one set, and the second and fourth for the other.&#10;&#10;Play and spin in turn. The highest spin leads. Use the sum of the numbers indicated by the Teetotum in making the moves, except in case of a doublet, which has its corresponding numbered Quoit space. The first player spins and places his man upon the Quoit space which corresponds to his throw. The others follow in turn playing in the same manner. Four rounds are played in this way, and the score is then made up. The count is as follows : Each man on the hub counts ten ; on a double number, three ; and on the other numbers two. In addition to the above, the man nearest to the hub counts five I the next nearest, three'; and the third, one. If two men hit the same space, the first corner is set back one space, if the rear space is vacant ; if occupied, the man goes for-ward on space, but should this space also be occupied it is removed from the board and does not count for its player. When four rounds have been played, the game is begun anew, and the play continues until some one of the players scores 60, which wins the game. The object of the game may also be to see which will make the highest score in four rounds.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Death Ride Kursk: Totenkopf builds on the existing Death Ride Kursk games for the XLVIII Panzer Korps by adding the IInd SS Panzer Korps Division Totenkopf.  This project takes the Death Ride Kursk game system to a new level.  The maps for the entire 9 game series have been redone.  The design for the new maps was done by Rick Barber and the artwork by Kyle Gebhardt.  Game play is still characterized by the BOS, or Battlefield Operating Systems.  The rules have been restructured to include all of the rules for the enhancements.  They have also been reformatted to make it easier to understand and improve rules clarity.  Remember that even though the basic system is an I-Go-U-Go type system the order in which units move and actions occur is very open.  Players have a tremendous amount of flexibility to perform firing, movement, and obstacle removal, can be done when the player needs them to be done.  This means you get to control the synchronization of the battles activity to suit your plan.&#10;&#10;While the rules are now quite large, they are very comprehensive.  Players will find great richness and depth in the level of detail.  There are now four different levels of game rules play.  From Basic to Ultimate.  For those wanting to play the basic game system you will still find great depth and detail.  For those wanting the ultimate experience you will find plenty of additional rules in the enhancements to make you feel like a real staff officer.&#10;&#10;This game will be the base for the three SS games and the follow on games for Leibstandarte and Das Reich will be expansions.  Totenkopf will be needed to play the other 2 games.  Included in this game will be the counters for the Command and Control and Fire Support Enhancements.  These add some great details and rules right from when you make your purchase.  The Air, Maintenance, and Logistics Enhancement counters will be sold separately and are not yet ready for sale.&#10;&#10;This game will come with:&#10;(16) 11x17 Full Color Map Sections&#10;(10) Unit and Marker Counter Sheets&#10;Death Ride Kursk Rules Booklet&#10;Totenkopf Rules Supplement&#10;(3) d10 Dice&#10;Numerous Charts and Tables&#10;&#10;",

Peter Pan has set out to help their escape, his battle with Captain Hook, and his villainous crew about to begin. Neverland is only for the brave. Those who dare to tread its pathways and cross its rivers should beware, evil deeds are planned tonight.&#10;&#10;The game is based on the original Hodder and Stoughton publication of Peter Pan and Wendy from 1921 which uses the illustrations of Mabel Lucie Attwell. The game takes extracts from the text and uses those original illustrations to capture the atmosphere and adventure of the book in an exciting game. The pieces and the packaging have been tastefully designed to make the game a collectors piece for children and parents to treasure today and throughout their lives.&#10;&#10;The player playing Peter Pan must set out to clear the mushroom clearings of pirates so the children can make good their escape. The player playing Captain Hook sets out from the Jolly Roger in an attempt to capture Peter Pan. His 6 pirates guard the mushroom clearings, making difficult for the children to escape. Players playing Wendy, Michael and John must find a way to the underground home.&#10;&#10;The game boils down to a roll and move with a card mechanic to throw some curves into the game. When Peter Pan and Captain Hook clash it becomes a dice duel between the two.&#10;&#10;The game includes a game board, hand crafted Peter Pan and Captain Hook pawns, 6 wooden pirates, 3 wooden children counters, 50 adventure cards, 30 pirate river cards and three wooden dice.&#10;&#10;",

First you start with your little wagon and try to be the first to arrive to the best land spots, there are six different choices of those. After that you go round the board and try to grab goods, crops, fish and so on (and later sell those). Game is divided to twelve months for five years (1858-1862), so you get to move 60 times during game.&#10;&#10;During game you draw cards which affect the prices for different goods, moves indians, starts auctions or sends you to jail.&#10;Sometimes you get to go to the saloon, for a little gambling. Or you can go hunting or fishing, but then you have a risk to encounter indians.&#10;&#10;Goal in the game is to collect as much money as possible, you get income from forests, fields, fish, gold etc. etc. Pioneer City is an old-fashioned game, which has clearly taken influence from Monopoly. But still there are couple of quite modern mechanics involved, little bit of choices and a little hint of theme.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The Battle of Kulikovo was fought between the armies of the Golden Horde under the command of Mamai, and various Russian principalities under the united command of Prince Dmitri of Moscow. The battle took place on 8 September 1380, at the Kulikovo Field near the Don River and was won by Dmitri, who became known as Donskoy (of the Don) after the battle. Although the victory did not end the Mongol rule over the Russian principalities, it is widely regarded by Russian historians as the turning point when Mongol influence began to wane and Muscovite power to rise&mdash;a process that eventually led to Muscovite independence and formation of the modern Russian state.&#10;&#10;This is a typical hex and counter game. Initiative is determined in each scenario and kept for the entire game. Players perform their actions in order, with possible reactions (when enemy units enter missle range). Example:&#10;&#10;1. Player A moves cavalry (reaction fire possible)&#10;2. Cavalry of player A attacks&#10;3. Player A moves infantry (reaction fire possible)&#10;4. Infantry of player A attacks&#10;5. Player B moves cavalry etc.&#10;&#10;Movement is determined by terrain and unit type. Battles are determined by comparing unit strength, which is modified by various factors (armor, charge, terrain, leaders etc.), and dice roll. Interesting elements of game mechanics include: fatigue of units, morale and cavalry movement (turning requires more space).&#10;&#10;",

On either long end of the board is a triangle comprised of six circles, three on each outer end (the Bases,) narrowing toward the center of the board.&#10;&#10;Each player has three pieces of varying colors called Knights which start the game on each player's Bases, and whose movements are determined by the spinning of a teetotum in a hole on the bottom of the game's box.  Currently there is no photo or record online to describe in what combination of colors the pieces were made, nor the teetotum.  Players do not take turns moving; they spin the teetotum to see which colors come up, and determine who moves and for how many spaces based on its outcome.  Knights always move towards the opponent's side of the board, unless no move is available, in which case they must move backward.  Knights may jump opponent's Knights, sending the opponent's piece back to one of its Bases.  The center safety spot prevents any occupying Knight from being jumped.  To win the game, a player must move all three of his Knights onto the opponent's Bases.&#10;&#10;",

Along the side of each piece is a number from zero to five, expressed with a blank or a number of dots.  (Later games like Tri-Ominos would place the numbers on the corners of the pieces.)   Also, in the center of each piece is a digit representing the sum of all the piece's sides.  The smallest number of unique combinations of pieces results in a fifty-six piece set, plus a special fifty-seventh piece marked with a star and called &ldquo;the boss.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;The game's inventor, Franklin H. Richards, included in his patent application several games to be played, involving matching the sides of the pieces or matching by the central (total) digit, and trying to outscore the opponent to win.  The boss piece may or may not be used in these games as a kind of joker, matching up to any number.  Also included with the patent is a description of a smaller set of triangular dominoes, with only the numbers zero through four, resulting in a total of 35 pieces, including the boss.&#10;&#10;",

Each player starts with a hand of 4 cards.  On their first turn, each player plays a single point card onto the table in front of themselves to form their pile, and then draws a card from the draw pile to maintain a hand size of 4 cards.  On subsequent turns, each player may take one of two actions:&#10;- Play 2 cards (an operation card (addition, subtraction, multiplication or division) and a point card) onto their pile or another player's pile, or &#10;- Discard one of the cards from his/her hand to the discard pile and draw a card from the draw pile.&#10;&#10;A scorekeeper is appointed at the beginning of the game, and keeps track of each player's score as they play cards on each player's piles.&#10;&#10;The first player to reach 15 points is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

The instructions suggest playing as individuals or teams, while playing to one of two possible win conditions:&#10;- After each correct answer, roll the die and score that many points.  The first individual or team to 50 points wins.  &#10;OR&#10;- The letters in the words &quot;NEW BRUNSWICK&quot; are assigned numerical values from 1 to 6, as follows: &quot;123 456123456&quot;.  Thus the number 2 is assigned to the &quot;E&quot; of &quot;NEW&quot; and the &quot;S&quot; of &quot;BRUNSWICK&quot;.  After each correct answer, roll the die and acquire the corresponding letters in the words &quot;NEW BRUNSWICK&quot;.  The first player to spell the words &quot;NEW BRUNSWICK&quot; wins.&#10;&#10;",

You do this by picking a random game piece from the bag and placing it on your side of the board in an attempt to make a match of 3 or more like pieces. Once a match has been made you take those matched pieces and place them on your opponent's side of the board trying really hard to mess their day up. The game is over and you are victorious once your opponent can not make any matches whatsoever...even if they tried really really hard or their side of the board is full.&#10;&#10;To add some ball'n variation to the game there are different characters to play as; each with their own special ability that is triggered whenever that player makes a match of its color. There are also white game pieces and black game pieces that will help you and hinder your opponent when drawn.&#10;&#10;There is also a 2v2 game mode.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Sheepshead is a trick-taking card game related to the Skat family of games. It is the Americanized version of a card game that originated in Central Europe in the late 18th century under the German name Schafkopf.&#10;&#10;Sheepshead is played with 7-8-9-10-J-Q-K-A in four suits, for a total of 32 cards. A sheepshead deck is made by removing all of the jokers, sixes, fives, fours, threes, and twos from a standard deck.&#10;&#10;Card strength:&#10;Card strength in sheepshead is different than in most other games. It is one of the most difficult things for some beginners to grasp.&#10;&#10;There are 14 cards in the trump suit: all four queens, all four jacks, and all of the diamonds. In order of strength from greatest to least:&#10;&#10;Q&clubs; Q&spades; Q&hearts; Q&diams;&#10;J&clubs; J&spades; J&hearts; J&diams;&#10;A&diams; 10&diams; K&diams; 9&diams; 8&diams; 7&diams;&#10;Also, there are 6 of each &quot;fail&quot; suit (18 total).&#10;A, 10, K, 9, 8, and 7 of &clubs;, &spades;, and &hearts;&#10;&#10;Clubs, spades, and hearts take no precedence over other fail suits, unlike trump, which always take fail. (Notice how both aces and tens outrank kings; arguably the most confusing aspect of card strength). The lead suit must be followed if possible; if not, then any card may be played such as trump (which will take the trick), or a fail card. Playing a fail of a different suit is called &quot;throwing off&quot; and can be a way to clear up another suit. Additionally, throwing off a point card is called &quot;schmearing&quot;.&#10;&#10;Card point values:&#10;Each card is given a separate point value as follows:&#10;Ace &mdash; 11 points&#10;Ten &mdash; 10 points&#10;King &mdash; 4 points&#10;Queen &mdash; 3 points&#10;Jack &mdash; 2 points&#10;9, 8, 7 &mdash; 0 points&#10;&#10;The strongest cards (queens and jacks) are not worth the most points, giving Sheepshead some of its unusual character.&#10;There are 120 points total in the deck. The goal of the game is to get half of these (60 or 61); in case of a tie, the player who picked up the blind loses, and that player's opponents win. (There are variant rules for more peculiar situations, such as the Leaster.)&#10;&#10;This is one of the few traditional card games with a hidden partner.&#10;&#10;Jack of Diamonds is a random partner method where the picker receives a partner without needing to call or lead a suit. The picker can still choose to &quot;go it alone&quot;, but needs to declare before the hand begins.&#10;&#10;",

Players used a spinner to race each other to the finish and collect &ldquo;gift&rdquo; cards along the way. &#10;From the rules:&#10;All Present cards are shuffled, and divided equally among the players. The players all use the same piece, spinning the indicator, and starting from Santa Claus' head-quarters, they moving the piece called Santa Claus, in turn, until he is carried over the entire road, and back to his home again. &#10;At the end of player's move, if Santa Claus stops at a house, the player takes the presents called for, from his pack of Present cards, and lays them aside. A player may not always have all the presents called for and, in that case, he lays aside all that he can. &#10;When a player lands on dot marked &quot;Go Back to Fourth House&quot;, &quot;Seminary&quot; or &quot;Orphan's Home&quot; Santa Claus is placed back, as directed, and the player delivers the presents called for, and Santa Claus starts on his travels again, from that place, as before. &#10;The player who first runs out of &quot;Present cards&quot; or the player who has the smallest number of &quot;Present cards&quot; in his hand, after Santa Claus has reached his home again, wins the game.&#10;Components: spinner, 20 cards (pairs of 10 different), and one wood game piece (Santa Claus).&#10;Size: 15&quot; x 17&quot;&#10;&#10;More about the box design:&#10;In the 19th century, Americans fell in love with Santa Claus. Clement Moore first published his poem &ldquo;An Account of a Visit From Saint Nicholas,&rdquo; which he originally wrote for his daughters, Margaret, Charity, and Mary, in 1823.&#10;German immigrant Thomas Nast who created the familiar image of the white-bearded man in the red suit that was reinterpreted by unknown artists for these box tops. During the Civil War, Nast drew on the German tradition of Saint Nicholas for a Harper&rsquo;s Weekly cover depicting Santa Claus as a &ldquo;spirit of Christmas&rdquo; visiting lonely soldiers in camp. The image proved to be a turning point in the popularity of Santa.&#10;&#10;",

Its neighborhoods, parks and city sectors are all built over a fine and innovative technological piece of hydraulic machinery. Its people live their pompous life in lavish luxury, as many trends among the society come and go.&#10;During this time, players find themselves, as overseers of a city sector, tasked with the duty of maintaining the city's prosperity. Thus, they're given a neighborhood in which they must expand.&#10;They must build buildings and invite prominent figures among the neighboring &quot;elite&quot; to help. All this in turn affects the society as it constantly demands more and more. And as the trends change so does the path to victory and to total prestige.&#10;In this game each player has his own board to build buildings. As players deploy them with puzzle-like strategy, they affect the society -the core aspect- of the game that changes according to the player's decisions. By selecting specific buildings they also acquire the help of individuals that offer them versatile abilities.&#10;All these changes however may result into a trend change in the society and so do the victory conditions.&#10;Whomever manages to be the most versatile in strategy and grasp the chance for success by earning the most victory points, will be the Grand Overseer and the victor of this game!&#10;&#10;",

You need one Mystique Deck to play the game.&#10; In Mystique Guilds, the combination of suit+colour is called &lsquo;guild&rsquo;. So there are 12 guilds (3 colours times 4 suits). Your goal is to control the most guilds when the game ends.&#10;&#10;Shuffle the whole deck and place it facing down in the middle of the table. This is the Draw Deck. Next to it a (now inexistent) Discard Deck will be created.&#10;&#10;Determine the starting player by any peaceful means. Players take turns in anticlockwise order during the game until the endgame condition is reached.&#10;&#10;On their turn, players must do only one of these 2 actions:&#10;&#10;- Pick one card from the Draw Deck or the Discard Deck.&#10;&#10;- Buy cards.&#10;&#10;How to buy cards:&#10;&#10;1. Place one of your cards facing up before you. This is the Influence Card.&#10;&#10;2. Draw up to as many cards from the Draw Deck as the number on your Influence Card.&#10;&#10;3. Place the Influence Card facing up on the Discard Deck.&#10;&#10;If, at any moment, the Draw Deck gets exhausted, the game ends.&#10;&#10;Each player adds up the values of each guild on their hand. The player with the highest value for each guild controls that guild and scores a point (tip: score the 12 guilds in order for clarity). In case of two or more players having the same value for a guild, none of them scores for it. The guild of blue suns is an exception and scores two points. So there are 13 available points in total.&#10;&#10;Ties for the first place are broken by the lowest number of cards. If a tie persists then play again.&#10;&#10;Variants:&#10;&#10;Variant 1: Cards can be bought from both decks.&#10;&#10;Variant 2 (the Market): You can buy cards from another player. Both players must agree on the cards being exchanged. The Influence card is given to that player instead of discarding it.&#10;&#10;",

Your objective is to capture all your opponents' castles, so that you are the last player remaining in the game.&#10;&#10;This game in the Risk family of games is markedly different than the original Risk. The combat mechanism is the same but players receive armies at the end of the turn, not the beginning (the sole exception being playing a Reinforcements card). The game has no territory cards, and one does not get armies based on the total number of individual territories. One gets armies for regions controlled and banners in one's castle only. Each player starts with a single banner in his castle but also takes the banners of any captured castles.&#10;&#10;The cards act as die modifiers (General and Marshall), allow attacks one would not normally be able to make (Admiral), get armies at the start of a turn (Reinforcements), force temporarily non-aggression pacts (Diplomats) and look at another player's cards, discarding one in the process (Spy). The Spy card can also be used to defend against another Spy.&#10;&#10;Risk&#10;&#10;Players are given army units to place onto the map of the world. Players use units to attack other players' positions, hopefully with superior numbers. Combat is a simple dice rolling affair that stresses attrition, and reinforcements are given to players who collect sets of cards.&#10;&#10;From the box:&#10;&#10;Europe is your battleground and enemy castles your target in this thrilling game of military strategy. Your tactics range from highly planned to hit-and-run, as you deploy your troops: Choose from Spies, Generals and Diplomats to carry out your battle plans. Call out your Marshalls, Reinforcements, the Admiral, and, just once in the game, your Hidden Armies. Now roll the dice to see who wins each battle.&#10;&#10;",

In the first round, each player lays down a card, drafts one of the available cards, then moves one of her ships to the right on the ocean. Players then repeat this process, possibly starting a new journey &mdash; a.k.a., new row of played cards &mdash; or adding to the journey already begun by playing a higher-valued card that what was last played. In the latter case, if the color of the card matches the color of the card previously played, the ship moves directly to the right; otherwise the ship moves both down and right.&#10;&#10;When a player can't add to a journey any more and must start a new one, she scores that voyage, possibly claiming one of the ship tiles on display based on the length of the voyage. (Each space on the game board's ocean has values on it, and the more times you move both down and right, the higher your score overall &mdash; doing this is more difficult than you'd hope for, however, since you must consistently have cards that are both of higher value and different color.) Each ship bears some combination of gems, and those are worth points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;If you have certain symbols on a voyage, you can claim bonus action cards that let you steal gems or cards from opponents, take cards from the discard pile, insert cards in a voyage, and so on. Get the right symbols, and you can claim the Madame Ching vessel, ending the game. Players then tally their points for destinations, gems, and so forth, and whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

Only if they are able to manage their pocket money successfully will they win the game.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;The players start with a given amount of pocket money and move across the board rolling one dice (d6). Movement is allowed in any direction and players may move less spaces than their dice roll. On special card fields they are able to fulfill six actions (spending money on several items and earning money to afford them) which are needed to win the game. The placement of the action cards is strictly ruled - making following-up cards harder to buy things (prices will rise) and harder to earn money (earnings will decrease). After each players' turn the turn marker is moved one day further. When the 7th turn ends (= one week) all players receive a new amount of pocket money.&#10;&#10;The first player who has fulfilled all his actions, wins. If there is a tie, the player with most of the cash wins.&#10;&#10;",

In order to fund your voyages into the unknown and excavate the ancient temples, you will have to first ship resources found on surrounding islands back to the resource-poor island of Thera.&#10;&#10;In Akrotiri &mdash; which combines tile placement, hand management, and pick-up and delivery &mdash; players place land tiles in order to make the board match the maps that they have in hand. Players excavate temples; the ones that are harder to find and the ones further away from Thera are worth more towards victory, but the secret goal cards keep everyone guessing who the victor is until the end!

Stalingrad: Verdun on the Volga is divided into several two-player scenarios (based on the historical German offensives in September and October). The game enables you to re-fight one of the most important battles of World War II in a single evening (a victory point check at the mid-way point that can keep games under three hours) using Rinella's favorite area impulse game system.&#10;&#10;- Turns represent four days of historical time.&#10;- The unit scale is roughly regimental, with some battalion-sized formations, versus battalion scale with some company-sized formations.&#10;- Only three units types - infantry, armor, and pioneer.&#10;- An accurate modeling of German combat attrition. Based on most recent publications utilizing post-Cold War Soviet sources (primarily Glantz).&#10;&#10;",

By now the teams cannot go back, so the only means of safely venturing further into the jungle is by building canopy walks to claim square by square of Valle Grande!&#10;&#10;Canopy Walk is a strategic tile-laying game in which two explorers compete by building the most efficient canopy walk over the valley by making the best use of the four types of regular tiles. Each type displays different canopy walks, or a canopy walk plus a connecting platform, or a canopy walk plus a dead end tree, or a dead end tree plus a connecting platform. Points are scored per square on a canopy walk (CW) by a player's color.&#10;&#10;",

The map leading to it has been cut in parts long time ago, and hidden in different places of the Caribbean Sea. In order to win the game, you will have to face and overcome all the other pirates also searching the Golden Pineapple map. Play your cards wisely to find the treasure and become a pirate of legends!&#10;&#10;RULE OVERVIEW&#10;&#10;Pi&ntilde;a Pirata is played in rounds. At each round, every player receives 8 cards. The goal is to be the first to get rid of all your cards.&#10;&#10;At your turn, you must play one card, or draw one if you can&rsquo;t. A card can be played if at least one of the pirates depicted on it is also on the top card of the play area. As soon as a player has no more card in her hand, she wins the round and gets a part of the treasure map. If a player has all 4 map parts, he wins the game!&#10;&#10;The tricky part come from the Adventure tiles: At the beginning of the game, 2 tiles are revealed. Each of those Adventures is a new rule that will change the gameplay. There are 40 different tiles with a lot of different rules. Use them as their best to play more cards than you should or prevent the other players to play theirs!&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, the winner chooses a new Adventure and adds it to the previous ones. The more the game is going, the more special effects are triggered for more and more fun!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Dream Heist is a board game that takes place in the dream world. The board represents the inside of a dreamer's mind, who is known as the Mark. Each player is trying to plant an idea in the Mark's dream, hoping that when he wakes, he will carry out their chosen task. The key is to make your task seem achievable to the Mark and to make sure he believes it was his own idea from its inception. In order to do this the dream needs to be so real, that when the Mark wakes up, the planted idea sticks and he performs the mission without a second thought.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with his or her own mission. This is the core idea that they are trying to plant inside the Mark's mind before the dream ends. Each mission is comprised of four steps: Architect, Forger, Extractor, and Inception. Players must collect the correct number of cards for each of these four steps in order to plant their idea fully. This is done by circling the different dream levels in the direction of your choice. There are spaces for collecting cards and planting ideas. Once an idea is planted in a certain section of the Mark's mind, that section is full. The other players must move to another dream level where the section in need is still available. There are also spaces where players encounter the Mark&rsquo;s subconscious, which can either help or hurt you.&#10;&#10;As you move down the dream levels to plant the different phases of your idea, you gain more points. However, it takes more time the further down the levels you go, so you have to plan your route wisely. Ultimately, the Mark will only carry out one player's planted idea when he wakes. This player receives extra points and increases his or her chances for victory.&#10;&#10;",

Amidst the power vacuum left by the King&rsquo;s untimely demise, the Royal Courtesans are all salivating over the claim to the high seat of the regency throne. Secret coalitions are banded, Schemes are plotted, and good ol&rsquo; daggers are stabbed in the back. Play your hand of Royals in a game of Dominance assertion, all the while screwing your competitor. The crown is within your grasp; you just need to step over others to get it!&#10;&#10;Royals is a micro card game that is quick to pick up, but hard to put down. The rules are simple. Each player draws a set of cards, and must utilize them in the right combination to net them the most points.&#10;&#10;But not so fast! For you can play each card in two ways - place it for points, or use its schemes for quick, chain comboing actions. This means there are bizzllions of ways that you could play your hand! Your perfect plan could easily be broken by other&rsquo;s schemes, and a risky draw might be all that you need to score big!&#10;&#10;So grab some buddies or kiddies, start up a game of Royals, and see who end up sitting on that throne!&#10;&#10;",

A deck of hunt cards is passed from vampire to vampire, each taking one card, reading it aloud, then passing the rest on. If a feeding card is drawn, all vampires gain blood tokens &mdash; but the deck is also loaded with events, vampire slayers, a vicious werewolf, invitations from the elders, and the creeping threat of sunrise. Feeling lucky? At any time during a hunt, a vampire may return to his coffin to protect his precious blood tokens. Return to your coffin too early, though, and you may miss all the fun. Then again, centuries of hunting should have taught you the folly of pushing your luck too far...&#10;&#10; Till Dawn comes in a coffin-shaped box with approximately 120 cards, more than one hundred tokens, eight character cards, and a &quot;night advancement&quot; track. (An additional pack of four characters will be available to expand your game to 12 players.)&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Victory Decision: Future Combat is a comprehensive game system to using SF Infantry units and Armoured Fighting Vehicles in Victory Decision. These rules cover almost all aspects of Science Fiction wargaming, from Troop Quality and Leadership to Air Strikes, Bunker Assaults, Combat in Buildings, Psi Powers, Vehicle and VTOL combat.&#10;&#10;Victory Decision: Future Combat features a unique Leadership-modified alternate unit activation system with an integrated Electronic Warfare aspect. The result is a fun and fast paced war game that involves both players constantly.&#10;&#10;The rules cover individually based infantry miniatures and also group- or multibased miniatures, aka Infantry Stands. While designed with 20-28 mm miniatures in mind the Victory Decision game system is flexible enough to handle any miniatures from 6 mm to 32 mm. So whatever your existing miniature collection consists of, you can start playing right away.&#10;&#10;This rulebook not only provides 8 generic Scenarios but also point based Force lists that can be used to represent many classic SF settings. All necessary Game Markers are also included within this book.&#10;&#10;",

Lovecraft, 1923&#10;&#10;In the unimaginable darkness of Kingsport, silent wanderers are called to a profane celebration. Their goal: to invoke unthinkable horrors! A dread terror that is not of this world or any other &mdash; but rather from the spaces between the stars &mdash; demands your submission. Meanwhile, unwary investigators vainly attempt to halt this appalling chapter in the dark history of Arkham.&#10;&#10;As the high priest of one of these shadowy cults, you must dominate the city. You will invoke cosmic creatures and unholy gods to receive their &quot;gifts&quot;, but you must take care to preserve your sanity and thwart the investigators who seek to stop you. This time, you are the bad guys. Why settle for the lesser evil?&#10;&#10;Kingsport Festival, a game of bizarre cults set in the terrifying world of Howard Philips Lovecraft, lasts 12 rounds, each divided into six phases. All Cultists roll their dice and the one that rolled the lowest sum will play first and so on, then (in turn order) each one may invoke an Elder God by using one or more of his dice, where the sum of their values is exactly equal to the number of the Elder God, or pass. Once all the dice are placed or players have passed, in ascending order, the Elder Gods give their gifts to the Cultists who invoked them: the Cultists may have to lose Sanity points to receive the rewards. After Cultists have taken their dice back, in turn order each one may place his disk on one Building that is connected to another one he has already marked (starting from the House). To do so, he must pay the Domain resources required.&#10;&#10;In turns marked with a blue marker on the Calendar, a Raid takes place: first the Event card and then the Investigator card is revealed. Each Cultist calculates his Strength by adding up any modifiers he has due to Spells, Buildings, and other game effects (such as Events, Scenarios, etc.). If his strength is greater, the Cultist receives rewards; if is less, he suffers the penalty.&#10;&#10;The game ends after the twelfth round is played. If the Scenario has a Festival card, it is revealed and its effects resolved at this time.&#10;The Cultist who has the most Cult points is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Over the centuries, many of the Wells have fallen Dark, but if the players can find and unseal the remaining Light Wells they prevent Xulth&ucirc;l from gaining substance and win the game. If Xulth&ucirc;l&rsquo;s Shadows, however, manage to defile a single Light Well, the demon will gain a body and enter the Realm. If this happens, the players must defeat Xulth&ucirc;l in battle to save the Realm.&#10;&#10;Players control avatars, heroic champions imbued with unique masteries over Light. Each turn, the players move through the Realm, confronting their fate, battling creatures with deadly abilities, and engaging the services of cities and mystics in order to gather the potions, treasure, and soulshards they will need to defeat the stronghold Guardians and unseal the Wells they protect. The Light or Dark nature of each Well is revealed only when its Guardian is defeated.&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, Xulth&ucirc;l&rsquo;s Shadows are thickening in the Shadow Realm and will enter the game at random times in random locations, seeking the one Well that will bring about the entrance of their master.&#10;&#10;",

Players are each dealt a suspect card. There are 4 suspects per case, one or more who may be guilty. One player reads aloud the case summary. Then, all players silently read their suspect&rsquo;s alibi. If the math in their suspect&rsquo;s alibi is correct, then he is innocent. Incorrect math indicates guilt. Players decide if their suspect is innocent or guilty and later take turns vocalizing their verdict and mathematical reasoning. Points are awarded based on correct determination of a suspect&rsquo;s innocence or guilt and also for describing why the guilty party&rsquo;s alibi did not jive (i.e., why the math was incorrect). The winner is the player with the most points after a pre-determined number of rounds or time limit set at the beginning of game play. You&rsquo;ll need to draw on a variety of math skills to solve these whodunit mysteries as each game includes 50 different cases.&#10;&#10;",

People are simply pawns in your quest to defeat the other barons and become the ruler of a unified human race. War, religion, technology - all will be used in this ultimate battle.&#10;&#10;Only you can decide the best way to exploit your loyal followers and make the most of the many powerful cards you are dealt. Will you upgrade as rapidly as possible, hoping to obtain that technological edge, or punish such folly with primitive weapons and fanatical attacks? Will you be relentless in your aggression or build an economic advantage? A variety of tactics are available to you at every turn, and you may find yourself putting bubonic plague on your opponent's robotics lab to slowly kill off the workers there, or attaching a computer network to a medieval church to automate the conversion of new followers. In this brutal struggle, many will die... but good planning, quick thinking, and a little luck will carry the day!&#10;&#10;",

The Fast Action Card version of the game includes 112 cards. Both the print and PDF versions can be played with either dice or cards (or both if one chooses). The only difference between the versions is one is printed and shipped and the other is downloaded. PDF purchasers will need to supply their own dice, but otherwise receive the same materials printed game purchasers receive.&#10;&#10;Each player card is based on the player's actual statistics for a given season and most teams have 32 to 35 players.&#10;&#10;",

If players win fewer than 7 tricks while bidding high, they lose 1 point for each trick below 7. The other team does not score.

        "name": "Court Piece",
        "description": "This game, which is very popular in India and Pakistan, has several names. The name Court Piece is sometimes written as Coat Piece or Coat Pees, Pees being a Hindi word meaning to deal. In Pakistan this game is often known as Rang, which means trump. In some places, for example in Goa, it is called Seven Hands: in India the English word &quot;hand&quot; is sometimes used to mean a trick - i.e. a set of cards, one played by each player in turn.&#10;&#10;Players and Cards&#10;There are four players in fixed partnerships, partners sitting opposite. Deal and play are anticlockwise.&#10;The dealer deals a batch of five cards to each player. The trump-caller player looks at his or her five cards and chooses and announces the trump suit. Then the dealer deals out all the remaining cards in batches of four, so that everyone has 13 cards.&#10;&#10;Winning&#10;The object of the game is to score courts by winning the majority of the tricks. The team that wins at least seven of the thirteen tricks (hands) wins the deal, and a team that wins seven deals in succession scores a court.It is also possible to score a court in a single deal by winning the first seven tricks, while the opposing team scores none. The overall winners of the session are the team that has scored most courts after an agreed length of time.&#10;&#10;Variations&#10;Some play that the card indicating the trump suit is kept face down, so that the players other than the trump caller do not know what the trump suit will be.&#10;&#10;Some play that the trump indicator card is selected at random from the first player's first five cards without looking, so that even this player does not know what the trump suit will be until the card is revealed.&#10;&#10;Double Sir&#10;Double Sir or Double Sar is a variant of Court Piece: the word sir (sar) means trick (hand). An online implementation of this variation can be found here: http://runng.com&#10;&#10;The deal, choice of trumps and rules of play are the same as in Court Piece, but in this variant, a player who wins a  trick does not gather in the cards, but turns the cards of the trick face down in the centre of the table. Cards are only gathered in when the same player wins two consecutive tricks. Until then the tricks pile up in centre.&#10;&#10;When a player does win two consecutive tricks, that player takes all the cards from the centre (the trick just won and the pile of previous tricks), adds them to his team's face down trick pile, and leads to the next trick. Scoring is then similar to Court Piece.&#10;&#10;Variants of Double Sir: Be-ranga Double Sar &#10;In this variant the dealer deals all thirteen cards and the play begins without trumps until some player is unable to follow suit. As soon as a player cannot follow suit, the suit of the card they play instead becomes trump for the rest of the deal. No tricks can be collected until the trick after the one in which trumps are determined.&#10;&#10;",

The active player rolls all the dice and forms the words &quot;ten&quot; and &quot;one&quot; from the results. For each &quot;ten&quot;, s/he may put aside a &quot;T&quot; (counting 10 points), for each &quot;one&quot;, s/he may put aside an &quot;O&quot; (counting one point). The remaining dice may be re-rolled as many times as desired, but when a player can form neither form a &quot;ten&quot; nor a &quot;one&quot;, s/he loses all the points from the current turn. &#10;The first player to reach 200 points is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Its name comes from the from the Hindi &quot;saat hant&quot; meaning &quot;seven hands&quot; and it is related to the Indian game of Seven Hands (also known as Court Piece). The objective is to win at least seven of the 13 tricks, or even better to win the first 7 tricks, or better still all 13 tricks.&#10;&#10;Players and Cards&#10;The game plays with four players in fixed partnerships using a standard 52-card pack. What distinguish Satat from other Whist-like trick tacking games are the fact that the 2 of heart is the highest trump card of the game and the ways trump is decided.&#10;&#10;Making Trumps&#10;The dealer shuffles, the player to dealer's right cuts, and the dealer deals a batch of five cards to each player. The trump maker, to dealer's left, looks at these five cards and announces the trump suit. Alternatively, if unwilling to decide trumps on the basis of these first five cards, the trump maker may elect to use the last four cards to determine the trump suit.&#10;&#10;End Game and Scoring&#10;Normally the play ends when one team wins by taking seven tricks. However, if a team wins the first seven tricks (a 7-0 win) they may continue the play and try to win all the tricks (13-0 win). The winning team then gets to pass cards to the losing team in exchange for trump cards in a way similar to Sergeant Major.&#10;&#10;There is no formal system of scoring and no fixed length to the game, but the players may like to keep track of how many games each team has won or lost.&#10;&#10;Variations&#10;&#10;Trup kasiet&#10;In this &quot;hidden trump&quot; variation, instead of announcing the trump suit, the trump maker places one card of the trump suit face down. If the trump card is selected unseen from the last four, the trump maker looks at it before placing it face down.&#10;&#10;In this variation 7-0 and 13-0 wins are more frequent, but no cards are exchanged after a 7-0 or 13-0 win.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The Nile Ran Red is a collection of three standalone card games set in a mythical ancient Egypt. Illustrated by John Ariosa, these card games all pit players against each other with a common goal: extending control over the land of the Nile. While all three games share a common theme and a common aesthetic, they are vastly different mechanically and no games share common components or art. With this collection of games, up to eleven players can be accommodated at once &mdash; albeit by playing different games.&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;In Lords of the Sand, each player takes on the role of one of four different gods: Anubis, Thoth, Sobek, and Khnum. Each god has its own unique agenda and special abilities.&#10;&#10;Throughout the course of the game, players use Units, complete their court, use special abilities, and build temple complexes. With a combo-driven card system, as cards are played, additional actions may spawn multiple abilities, but a limited action system keeps downtime to a minimum.&#10;&#10;Lords of the Sand offers multiple paths to victory, unique card play, and various special abilities with a playing time of about thirty minutes, plus ten minutes for each player above two.&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;In Rise of the First Dynasty, 3-5 players vie for control over the whole of Egypt as the potential leader of the mythical first Dynasty of the ancient land along the Nile.&#10;&#10;Each player has a set of three identical actions. Played over ten Aeons (or rounds), in each Aeon each player chooses one of his action cards. Depending on the actions chosen by each other players, the player will gain actions, such as conquering new lands, blessing the lands he has already conquered, or using Edict cards to thwart the other players' plans and protect his own. Light, quick, and downright dirty, Rise of the First Dynasty plays in around 30 minutes and scales well regardless of players.&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;In Crimson Sun, two players take on the role of leaders of Upper and Lower Egypt. Playing units of four unique gods (Kuk, Babi, Horus, and Sekmet), players build their forces and attempt to assert influence over four key structures. Players may choose to either draft decks at the beginning of the game, or use a single deck.&#10;&#10;During the game, players use the Unit cards in a variety of ways to increase his overall strength, to use special abilities, or to secretly try to gain control over the structures. The core mechanisms of this game are pulled from a previous Small Box Games release &mdash; Bhazum &mdash; but mechanical and thematic changes have lead to a game that should be a fresh experience for players already familiar with the earlier game.&#10;&#10;",

The game consists of a central six-pointed star piece, each point being marked on both outer edges with a number of dots from one to six, and thirty-six triangular tiles marked along their edges with numbers ranging from one to six.&#10;&#10;To begin the game, the tiles are placed face down and shuffled, and two or more players draw an agreed upon number.  The player who has drawn a tile with three sixes goes first, matching a tile to one of the central star's numbered edges.  The players then take turns matching their tiles to the original in order to create a hexagon shaped star adjoining the central piece.  If no match is possible, a player must pass.  The player who completes the hexagonal star gets one point, and the next player begins another star by matching a tile to the central star.  If no player can match a piece, that star is blocked and play begins on another.  The player scoring the most points (there are a maximum of six) wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Due to the fact that the cards become obsolete in a few years, if not months, and that a different version would be needed not only for each language, but for each country, it will never be published, so I have published it as a downloadable pdf on this website. Of course, the cards are for a French version, but if anyone finds the idea fun enough and wants to make a US version (or a version for any other country), he is welcome to do it.&#10;&#10;",

(Gnomes Engaging And Recovering the Standard). Players are walked through the last moments before the bay doors open, connecting to the mainframe computer and assigning the positions of your R.A.T.s (Recon Attack Team). A high-tech feel is produced through bullet holes, digital accents and blue metal artwork, both across the game board and cards.&#10;&#10;GAME PLAY:&#10;Players take turns moving their team (consisting of one Champion and four R.A.T.s) to the center of the board. R.A.T.s are divided into melee and ranged fighters, each with unique and limited moving patterns and attack abilities. Your Champion may move one space in any direction and is the only character who can complete the game by grabbing the Standard.&#10;&#10;R.A.T.s engage and run interference while your Champion navigates the battlefield. Power cards and specialty cards provide unique abilities, buffs, advantages and pitfalls which can enhance your ability to harm or hinder opponents. Fellow players can also engage in combat, assisting either attacking or defending players by discarding cards from their hands.&#10;&#10;GOAL:&#10;The focus is to get your Champion to the Standard first.&#10;&#10;",

In the Adventure Time episode &quot;Card Wars&quot;, Jake begs Finn to play his favorite trading card game. Finn accepts, despite warnings from Beemo on how very competitive Jake can be while playing the game. Finn and Jake battle against each other to decide who will be the Dweeb and who will be the Cool Guy.&#10;&#10;Now fans can play the actual Card Wars game in Adventure Time Card Wars: BMO vs. Lady Rainicorn, with all of the action taking place in four combat lanes.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player has two Action Points to spend on Creatures, Spells, and Locations, and cards cost between 0 and 2 Action Points to play. When you summon a Creature, you choose which lane you want to place it in; some Creatures have FLOOP abilities that allow you to use their special abilities. When you attack with a Creature down a lane, you might find an opposing Creature, or you might get to deal your damage straight to your opponent's Hit Points. Reduce your opponent's Hit Points from 25 to 0 and you're the Cool Guy (and you win the game)!&#10;&#10;Each Card Wars starter set has a pair of different forty-card decks and is ready to play right out of the box. Mix the decks together to come up with your own righteous combos!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "THEME:&#10;The game is based on a comical aspect pulled from Jaime Buckley's &quot;Chronicles of a Hero&quot; series--the animated smiley face on the main character's shirt. Always revealing the true feelings of Wendell through silent expressions, this concept was applied to the comical facial expressions of the game cards.&#10;&#10;GAME PLAY:&#10;Based on the traditional GO FISH! rules (both US and AUSTRALIAN versions), players must ask for cards by mimicking the facial expressions contained on their card. If the player being asked does not have the expression asked for, they respond by saying &quot;GO Smiley!&quot; and a card is drawn. Traditional rules apply.&#10;&#10;GOAL:&#10;The game continues until either someone has no cards left in their hand or the stock runs out. The winner is the player who then has the most books.&#10;&#10;GO Smiley! is also used as a memory game for children&#10;&#10;",

If you take more that your quota you score minus one point for each surplus trick; if you take less than your quota you score plus one for each trick below.&#10;&#10;For each round, after the players have looked at their hands, the dealer decides how many cards he wants from the pickup (zero to 13). He discards this number of cards from his hand, and then draws an equal number from the top of the pickup, which remains face down. If there are cards remaining in the pickup, the process is repeated with other players.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player with the most points at the end of the fourth round.&#10;&#10;",

The suit of this card, which belongs to the dealer, is the trump suit for the hand.&#10;&#10;The Play&#10;The aim is to win tricks. Each trick consists of two cards, one played by each player. The first player plays any card and the second player must play a card of the same suit if possible.

As the subsequent pieces are placed this forms a pattern that becomes the playing surface (the pieces themselves become the board). Unlike other such games, the pieces are never eliminated and not all have to be played. The object of the game is to totally surround your opponent's queen, while at the same time trying to block your opponent from doing likewise to your queen. The first player to totally surround his opponent's queen wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

We'll figure that out later, though &mdash; first, let's free some desperadoes!&#10;&#10;Each player has five desperadoes in jail at the start of the game, each with a different symbol on them. On a turn, you roll four dice up to three times, putting aside any dice you want to save. If you combine a &quot;hit&quot; with a symbol on a desperado, you rotate that desperado disc, moving him one step closer to freedom. Each desperado requires a different number of steps to reach freedom, and once free, when you hit that same desperado, he now robs money from the other players.&#10;&#10;Certain dice combinations allow you to draw multiple bonus cards and choose one or two that you like, and if you skunk out and don't do anything else, you take the top card as compensation. The cards let you take special bonus actions like not paying opponents and using symbols in different ways.&#10;&#10;Win by freeing all of your desperadoes before anyone else or by being the last one in the game.&#10;&#10;",

What's more, your dreams have told you that the time has come, the stars have aligned so that you can perform the &quot;Ritual of Appeal&quot; and bring the Grand Octopus to surface once again. To perform the ritual, however, you need the right magical components, components to be found in a famous English university for young wizards and witches &mdash; and you're not the only one seeking them.&#10;&#10;In each round, players secretly place their cultist and monster tokens on locations, then reveal those locations at the same time. If only one cultist group occupies a location, that cult gains strength &mdash; but if two or more cults want the same spot, they must negotiate or both lose cult strength. If, on the other hand, a rival monster occupies the location, the cultist is eliminated. Gulp!&#10;&#10;",

These cards allow special plays:&#10;&#10;1.  Take a card from each player, mark it on your clue sheet, and return to players.&#10;2.  Choose a player who must secretly show you two cards.&#10;3.  For the rest of the game, you may ask one additional question every time you ask a CLUE question.&#10;&#10;The 2013 version also places 3 cards face up for all players to see at the beginning of the game in 4 and 6 player games.&#10;&#10;",

However, players are restricted in connecting railcars of only the same value or good type, so if you grab a railcar you can't use, it needs to wait in your sorting yard until it can legitimately hook up to your train.&#10;&#10;Players start with five cargo cards in hand, and four railcar cards are laid out into the Arrival Yard. Each player has one exchange token, representing one of the five cargo types, and whoever is to the right of the start player has the Yardmaster Token. On a turn, a player takes two actions, repeating an action if desired; whoever holds the Yardmaster Token takes a third action on his or her turn, then passes this token to the right. Players can:&#10;&#10;    Draw a cargo card from the deck or from the top of the discard pile.&#10;    Buy a railcar by discarding 1-4 cargo cards of the same color as the railcar, with the number determined by that railcar's value.&#10;    Swap your exchange token for another one; you can discard two cargo cards matching the color of your token to represent one cargo card of the proper color when buying a railcar.&#10;&#10;&#10;Five cargo cards provide bonus actions during play, such as paying less for new railcars or drawing free cargo cards. The first player to reach 16 points in a 2-3 player game or 18 points in a 4-5 player game wins.&#10;&#10;",

With a dynamic play area based on every card played, the game constantly adapts itself to film fans of any level of skill or knowledge. Want to throw a wrench into things? Director's Cut cards can often hinder your friends or change the rules to keep things interesting. Now you finally have an outlet for that wealth of movie trivia building up in your brain!  &#10;Cinelinx is a new take on movie trivia games and is the perfect way to test your movie knowledge and challenge your friends during your next movie or game night!&#10;&#10;&#10;Rules&#10;1) Separate Director&rsquo;s Cut cards from the main deck and set them aside nearby. Then shuffle the main deck and allow each player to draw 10 cards.&#10;2) An anchor card is needed to start the game. We recommend locating a genre card from the main deck and dropping it in the center of the table to begin. The remaining genre cards should stay in the deck to be drawn randomly during gameplay.&#10;3) Decide amongst yourselves who will go first, and then continue playing clockwise.&#10;4) Players should take turns connecting cards in their hands to cards in play. Players can only play ONE card during their turn, unless instructed otherwise by a Director&rsquo;s Cut card.&#10;Tip: Cards can be dropped vertically or horizontally and connected to any open side of a card in play. The reels that are formed as cards connect should not touch unless a valid connection is made.&#10;&#10;5) Connections must be verbally announced to be considered valid. A connection can be defined as the relationship between two cards. See our official rulebook for complete connection details.&#10;Example announcement: &ldquo;Jonah Hill and Leonardo DiCaprio can be connected because they were both in &lsquo;The Wolf of Wall Street&rsquo;. &ldquo;&#10;&#10;6) During their turn, if a player does not have a playable card in their hand they can DRAW a card and play it immediately, if possible. If they still do not have a playable card in their hand they can draw a second time and play the card immediately, if possible. If they still do not have a playable card then their turn is over. &#10;Instead of drawing, if a player cannot play a card in their hand they can choose to SWAP up to three cards in their hand with three random cards from the main deck. Once a player has swapped cards their turn is immediately over. A player can only SWAP once per game. Cards that are discarded should be placed back into the main deck.&#10;7) A connection can be challenged at any time.&#10;8) The first person to shed their full hand wins.&#10;&#10;Director&rsquo;s Cut&#10;During gameplay, when someone plays a Directors card from their hand they are allowed to draw from the Director&rsquo;s Cut deck and should follow the instructions on the card they draw. Most Director&rsquo;s Cut cards can be played immediately. &#10;Challenging a play&#10;If a connection is challenged and is proven VALID then the challenger must either draw a card or lose a turn. The player who was challenged can decide which option the challenger should proceed with.&#10;If a connection is challenged and is proven INVALID then the player who was challenged must take their card back and draw an additional card. Their turn ends immediately after they draw.&#10;&#10;Download the Cinelinx Rulebook&#10;&#10;",

Ground and air battles still need to be resolved separately.&#10;&#10;The game features 7 factions (4 humans, 3 aliens), with their own abilities and special units.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;General gameplay &#10;&#10;Every turn, Alien factions adapt stronger warships, clone more soldiers, and prepare their mothership.&#10;The objective of the alien team is to successfully complete a mothership and have it land on planet Earth.&#10;&#10;To counter the alien invasion, human factions recruit soldiers, launch attack jets and develop secret weapons.&#10;The objective of the human team is to build a spacecraft, and have it destroy the alien colony. They must also down any mothership that would come.&#10;&#10;Other victory options are available.&#10;Aliens can win the game if they terrorize enough cities to create such chaos that the human directors will be dismissed.&#10;This happens immediately if the Terror Counter reaches 13.&#10;&#10;And any team wins the game if at the end of 12 turns, no team has met victory conditions, and it has the most Prestige.&#10;&#10;&#10;Game modes: Full Cooperative or Team vs Team &#10;&#10;The normal game can be played with any number of players from 2 to 7, and can have an asymetric number of players.&#10;&#10;Players can choose to play in the Earth United mode, in full cooperation. &#10;Or they can play in the default Alien Invasion mode, with a team of aliens versus a team of humans.&#10;&#10;Each player picks a faction at the beginning of the game.&#10;Earth United is limited to the human factions (4 players).&#10;In Alien Invasion, there are 4 human factions and 3 alien factions available.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The first player finishing the 2nd round wins.&#10;&#10;The game has some unique twists on the racing-game genre:&#10;- upgrade your hand cards by buying new cards during the pitstop&#10;- the first/second player to finish the pitstop gets a bonus&#10;- collect Carrera Coins by passing-pay and stopping on chicanes&#10;- build the race track during play &#10;- use DRS markers to get special advantages&#10;- cards control the cars and give special abilities&#10;- change lanes like in real slot-car-racing&#10;&#10;",

She prowls the game board and shots off the legs of the bugs. Also, whenever two bugs meet, the arriving bug bites one leg off the other bug. The Bugs can only move when they have all six legs attached. To attach a lost leg, they have to roll a 1 or 6. The game is played with 2 dice. The red one determines the movement (clockwise) of the bugs, while the blue one moves the maid counterclockwise.&#10;&#10;The game was most likely published in the 1930s.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Castle Assault is a unique gaming experience combining the ferocious onslaught of Tower Defense games with the strategic elements of CCGs and progressive advancement of RPG's.  Castle Assault seeks to break the mold of traditional card games and organically extracts the most enjoyable parts of these different genres and distill them into a standalone concept. Castle Assault plays in about 30 mins, and is for 1 or 2 Players.&#10;&#10;Each Player controls a Castle on either side of the Battlefield with 10 Health and a Hero outside of the Battlefield.  Players play Units from their hand to the gameboard and these Units physically move toward the opposing Castle based on the Abilities of that Unit and your choices with the intent to bring your opponent from 10 to 0 Health.  Should you destroy your opponents Castle or destroy their Hero you win!&#10;&#10;&quot;More details please&quot; - a Battle Card Game with tons of combat and strategy.  Card combat is fast and furious; every time two opposing Units touch each other in the same column, they Engage in combat (which is often), and can happen either during the Move Units step or during the Open Phase by Charging or using an Ability described on your Units.  Combat is resolved immediately with Unit cards exchanging their combat values at the same time (with no luck involved).  Should either Unit have a higher attack number then the Armor + Health of the opposing Unit, that Unit is destroyed.  Should a Unit smash the opposing Castle without a defending unit, that Unit attacks the opposing Castle directly lowering that Castles Health by the Unit's attack value.&#10;&#10;Your Hero grants some bonuses throughout the game and you can even join the Battlefield to turn the tide, however should your Hero be destroyed you immediately lose the game.  As you progress through the 1-Player Campaign and complete feats or heroism you can level up and customize your Hero based on the way YOU play. &#10; Every deck is also customizable meaning your Unit selection can be optimized before battle, but note this is not a 'pay-to-play' type game.  You receive all the cards from all warbands including the 1-Player warband in the Core Edition (NO BOOSTERS).&#10;&#10;Most Units have Abilities to; keep them alive, move more quickly, laterally move, resurrect, summon allies, surprise, dissipate, and damage the opposing Castle from afar.  You may feign attacks, play Commands to make your Heroes more powerful in a myriad of methods to tactically breakdown your opponent.&#10;&#10;The 1-Player Campaign provides a &quot;Right-Outta-the-Box Experience&quot; with 9 Scenarios culminating in a final boss showdown.  1-Player mode operates by Monsters auto-populating in the opposing Castle with your victory condition changing every Scenario including outright smashing the opposing Castle, destroying a boss overlord, or surviving the onslaught.  With 9 Scenarios per 6 warbands it creates 54 different challenges  (9 campaigns x 6 warbands = 54 games).&#10;&#10;",

Take these &quot;magic boxes&quot; with you (the dice), and throw them in order to activate their trapping mechanisms. Should they result in the right symbols (roll the correct result), then they shall be baited correctly in order to attract and trap whatever Slime inhabits the area. Can you bring back a higher valued Bounty than the other hunters?&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;&#10;     4    Dice for trapping Slimes&#10;     32  Slime Cards &#10;    2     Instruction Cards&#10;    2     Score Reference Cards&#10;    1     Box&#10;&#10;&#10;Gameplay Summary:&#10;&#10;Each turn, 4 Slime Cards are drawn and placed in front of the active player. The active player must roll a certain number on the dice in order to trap one or more of them, depending on the colors drawn. If the player is unsatisfied with their dice roll, they may remove one of their dice in order to reroll all of the remaining dice and trap a higher number of slimes for the turn. Gameplay and turns continue this way until the Slime deck is completely gone through twice, then the players reference the Score Reference Card to figure up their scores and determine the winner.&#10;&#10;Scoring:&#10;&#10;Each Slime is worth 1 point on its own, but additional points bonuses are awarded when certain criteria are met, such as collecting 1 of each color or the most of a specific color.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Chanakya's Chakkravyuh is a unique learning tool in the form of a financial board game. Its main purpose is to help players from all walks of life (including common man, entrepreneurs, corporate professionals, students, educators, home makers, investors) attain financial literacy. Minimum age is 15 years and above.&#10;&#10;Inspired by the 2000-year old wisdom of prominent Indian economist Chanakya, this game enlightens individuals on how to manage money and connect financial knowledge to resourceful opportunities, which are ever-present in today's changing world.&#10;&#10;The player initially chooses a dream out of various dreams listed on the board. Each dream has a purchase price listed on it. In order to win the game, the player must purchase his/her pre-selected dream.&#10;&#10;There are two parts in the game, the first is Chakkravyuh and second is Rajmarg. All players start inside the Chakkravyuh. In the first part of the game, a player may not have enough money to buy his/her dream. Chanakya's Chakkravyuh simulates real-life investment opportunities, various market scenarios, and unforeseen life situations to throw challenges that the participants have to tackle. By successfully navigating these challenges and deriving &quot;passive income&quot; (income where each rupee works to bring you even more rupees), participants eventually build enough income generating assets to move into the second part of the game, i.e. the Rajmarg. It is in the Rajmarg that the player can acquire their pre-selected &quot;dream&quot;.&#10;&#10;Even though there is no official time limit, the entire game normally lasts about 4 hours. The first player to purchase his/her dream wins the game, and that is officially the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The experiential nature of a game-based environment makes the process of learning a lot more fun, and there is also a sense of competition among the participants.&#10;&#10;Besides gaining financial knowledge and learning how to leverage passive income, participants will understand the real difference between an asset and a liability. Additionally, important lessons will be learned in basic accounting principles, debt financing, interpersonal communication, negotiations and joint deal-making.&#10;&#10;No background in business or finance is required. Absolutely anyone can play this game.&#10;&#10;",

Everytime he rolls a cat-face he has to say &quot;Meowww&quot;&#10;- The race coordinator is moving the pieces (race car and cat) on the board. If the cat catches the car or the car reaches the STOP-sign he has to say &quot;Stooop!&quot;&#10;&#10;There are variants in the game that make it more challanging:&#10;- Secondary attribute: Race cars puzzled together do have to have the same color. In this variant the secondary attribute (color of stripes &amp; Helmets) has to fit, too.&#10;- The second side of the game board features obstacles (looping, jump) that need special sounds.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the first car finishes one round.&#10;&#10;",

The cards are revealed simultaneously. The player with the &quot;best fitting&quot; speed wins the track section (= VP). Players that have played the same speed collide and cannot win that track section.&#10;&#10;If players collide they have to move down with a marker on their card representing the status of their race-car.&#10;&#10;Special cards like &quot;Hold Speed&quot; (copy value of last card), &quot;Pitstop&quot; (take played cards to the hand) and &quot;Roll Die&quot; (extremely slow or very fast) expand the possibilities.&#10;&#10;The game ends ...&#10;... when the stack of track sections is empty&#10;... when one car is destroyed&#10;The players with the most VP (on cards plus the status of the own car) wins. A player who has destroyed his car cannot win.&#10;&#10;",

Each of the 5 main characters is represented by a suit/color, and each has an identical set of 5 action cards, with corresponding power that will help that character win the (fictional) game in question:&#10;&#10;- Eliminate (1) - removes another card from the game&#10;- Defend (2) - protects previously played cards&#10;- Swap (3) - swaps cards between players&#10;- Strategize (4) - adds to the power of any other card&#10;- Gloat (5) - does nothing really, but has the most power&#10;&#10;The game begins with a quick draft so each player can develop their own strategy, but each turn of the game consists of a player playing a single card. You execute its action, and the card remains in front of you as power towards winning that character. Players are vying to have the highest total power in each character, but player with the highest only scores points equal to the power his opponents control. And since there are five different characters, there are five opportunities to score, so players want to have the highest strength in each character, but only by a slight margin and in as many characters as you can for maximum points.&#10;&#10;",

A standard 52 card pack is used.&#10;&#10;Deal&#10;Any player may deal first, and the turn to deal passes to the left after each hand. The cards are not shuffled between deals: the dealer simply gathers the cards from the previous hand, stacking the tricks together, cuts the pack and starts dealing. The deal will result in everyone having a hand of 13 cards.&#10;&#10;Bidding&#10;Bids are an undertaking to win at least the stated number of tricks with the help of a partner chosen by nominating a card. The bidder will choose the trump suit but the bids do not mention a suit, only the number of tricks.&#10;&#10;Play&#10;The highest bidder leads to the first trick, naming the trump suit and the called card. The identity of the partner is definitively revealed only when the called card is played, though it may be guessed earlier because the partner will try to play cards that will help the bidder.&#10;&#10;Scoring&#10;The bid succeeds if the bidder together with the holder of the nominated card win at least as many tricks as the number that was bid. In this case they each score the amount of the bid.  If the bidder and partner fail to win enough tricks between them, the other two players score the amount of the bid.&#10;&#10;A separate cumulative score is kept for each player and the game can continue until someone reaches the agreed target score, typically 101. The player with most points then wins.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": " &gt;&gt;&gt; ICE COLD ICE HOCKEY IS NOW LIVE ON BOARDGAMEARENA.COM!!!&#10;&#10;Ice Cold Ice Hockey is a thinking-man's card game that has been designed to simulate all the excitement of professional ice hockey. An action deck of 64 cards, three rink-cards and comprehensive yet easy-to-understand rules comprise the complete game (although you'll need to supply a small token, disc or coin). The cards serve multiple purposes, including passing, skating, shooting, defense, shot-blocking and goaltending. Experienced players will be able to complete a game in about an hour.&#10;&#10;Note that this is NOT just a &ldquo;draw and play cards (or a take-that!) game.&rdquo; Card combinations and good decisions are key in ICIH. You&rsquo;ll always want to keep an Inside Shot card in your hand, for example, in the hope of pairing it up with a Pass or Skate card that leads to an Inside Shot. (Your brain will be working on all cylinders during the entire game, and your play will improve over time as you learn to watch for the appearance of important cards.)&#10;&#10;I call the above a &ldquo;set-up.&rdquo; Three and even four-card set-ups are possible, and over time you&rsquo;ll learn what they are. You can also bluff a bit; for example, if you have a surplus of Offensive Zone (OZ) Skate or Pass cards but no Inside Shot card, you can play an OZ card which allows the play of a defensive card to tease one out of your opponent&rsquo;s hand.&#10;&#10;ICIH features realistic shots on goal, scoring and game play. Sometimes you&rsquo;ll effortlessly set up end-to-end plays while at other times you&rsquo;ll only be able to dump the puck out of your own defensive zone. You&rsquo;ll shoot from the point and, after some effort, from close-in. On defense, sometimes you&rsquo;ll be able to challenge the puck-carrier and sometimes you won&rsquo;t. Sometimes you&rsquo;ll have to risk a penalty to stop an opponent&rsquo;s scoring chance. Loose pucks, blocked shots, breakaways, fighting, momentum, penalties, super-saves &ndash; they&rsquo;re all here in Ice Cold Ice Hockey!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Divinity is a cooperative turn-based card game for 2 to 4 people, in which each player assumes the role of a deity trying to forge the universe as it is eaten away by powerful disasters of mysterious origin. As players work together, the universe either succumbs to the calamities or is saved by the grace of the gods!&#10;&#10;The goal of the players in Divinity is to accumulate points by creating various objects in their galaxies. The divine cards are used by players to achieve their goal, while calamity cards are force-played through to game, undermining the players' efforts. Depth is created through the interaction of all these cards, creating new situations every game and requiring players to consider card abilities carefully in order to master the game.&#10;&#10;When the game ends, players add all their points together to judge the fate of all they've built. Players must play wisely, as both divine and calamity cards can cause the game to end. Control of both points and when the game ends is critical to success.&#10;&#10;Divinity is inspired by cooperative games heavy in strategy and planning, as well as light and chaotic party games. It's made to be quick to set up, easy to learn, but full of endless wonder. Why not try being a god today?&#10;&#10;",

They move around by secretly playing movement cards that are all shuffled together before being read and played.&#10;&#10;The goal is to catch your target while evading your assassin. Points are scored for successfully assassinating a player, identifying your would-be killer, or scaring players into making mistakes as a ghost from beyond the grave, so even dead players are still in on the action!&#10;&#10;Can you safely navigate the treacherous crowds of the most dangerous AssassinCon yet?&#10;&#10;",

As soon as one of the players succeeds, the target moves, forcing the other players to change direction and try to reach the new location.

After a predefined number of rounds, the player who has the least penalty wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Unfortunately, removing the gems has disrupted the integrity of the area, and now the whole city threatens to collapse around you!  Your only hope is to work your way through the city and figure out which gems act as the keys to stop the collapse.&#10;&#10;But be careful!  The more you move throughout the city, the faster it weakens, and the sooner it will collapse...&#10;&#10;...and if that wasn't enough!  The gems are all cursed!  If the you're skilled enough to survive, be sure you have the least cursed gems...or else the consequences will be swift and painful!!!&#10;&#10;&#10;Players use deductive reasoning to establish which gems were removed from play at the beginning of the game.  This is accomplished by strategically moving along a play area composed of tiles that the players may rotate, push, and move between.  Rotating and pushing tiles speeds up the end of the game, so it's best to be judicious in how often you do so.&#10;&#10;A cooperative game, if the hidden gems are not identified by game's end, then there is no winner.  However, if the group does solve the mystery, then the player in possession of the least cursed gems is victorious!&#10;&#10;",

Each player takes the reins of one of these big corporations and tries to develop it in order to grow and achieve power.&#10;&#10;To win the game, players must carefully choose which types of industry to invest in to get the most influence over the Japanese islands.

        "description": "In Arkwright players run up to four factories in England during the late 18th Century. Your goal is to have the most valuable block of own shares. Thus, you must increase your share value and buy shares from the bank.&#10;&#10;To run the factories, you need workers. When hiring Workers, demand is automatically created. But of course you want to replace your expensive workers (wage 2-5) by machines (1). To have more output from your factories you may employ new Workers or improve your factory to the next technical level.&#10;&#10;You fix the price for your goods during an action round. To enhance your chances of selling goods, you improve your factories to higher levels, increase the quality and make some sales promotion. The higher these factors, the better are your chances of success - the higher the price, the lower.&#10;&#10;Each player has an own set of &quot;action tokens&quot; like &quot;build and modernize factories&quot;, &quot;employ new workers&quot;, &quot;improve quality&quot; etc. On your turn you place one of those tokens on one of the free spaces in your line of the &quot;Administration board&quot; and pay the according administration costs, ranging from 2 to 10 (even numbers). Some actions depend on how much you paid, i.e. you may buy more machines with one single action, when you pay more (= use a higher space, which is then blocked for the rest of the round). During the game your actions become more and more effective by new tokens, i.e. allow you to buy 3 machines in a single turn instead of 2, increase quality 2 levels instead of only 1...).&#10;&#10;After each round of actions one kind of factories is active and you have to pay for all your workers and machines there, then sell the manufactured products. The value of your shares increases for sold products and best quality.&#10;&#10;Goods may also be traded to the colonies by ship - provided you have a contract with the monopoly of the East Indian Company.&#10;&#10;After four turns each of the factories has produced and the round ends. Players remove the action tokens from the administration board and reveal an event token. After 5 rounds the player with the most valuable block of shares wins. Neither being to be the one with the most shares nor being the one with the highest share value guarantees victory.&#10;&#10;Arkwright allows you to act in different ways. Run all four factories with most possible output, set the focus on only two factories and improve them more than the others can; use shipping to colony or focus on the home market. In any way you have to react to the opponents and their strategy. Enter markets with deficit in supply or give up business where the other players start to push you out. Buy shares when they are cheap and increase the value, or first make money and buy shares later.&#10;&#10;To get familiar with the market mechanics you may start with a 120 minutes version &quot;Spinning Jenny&quot;, but for those who like full strategy in economic themed games, the 240 minute &quot;Waterframe&quot;-Rules come with more options to improve your factory and use ships.&#10;&#10;",

With a unique deck of captain cards, individual strengths, and special abilities, each captain offers players a very different game experience.&#10;&#10;Players seek to explore and control locations in the galaxy to gain the resources, artifacts, and technology to help them face more difficult encounters later in the game. As players explore the galaxy, and time passes, encounters become more rewarding, but the penalty for failure rises. Players determine the length of the game by how quickly they move through the galaxy, and how well they manage the damage inflicted on them by their travels, or by their fellow captains.&#10;&#10;The galaxy offers a variety of encounters where players can control individual locations through the use of six different skills, such as science, diplomacy, or tactics, depending on an individual&rsquo;s play style and captain&rsquo;s strengths. Players can also brave open space, random encounters which increase in difficulty as the game progresses, or explore discoveries and uncover many different stories in the game. How well a player does at exploring and controlling the galaxy is reflected in their victory points.&#10;&#10;Made up of modular tiles, the galaxy itself, and many of the elements within, is very different each and every time you play Emergence Event, allowing for great replayability and unique challenges with every game.&#10;&#10;",

The players pull chits indicating which section of the battle field is activated, with a mechanism somewhat reminiscent of the Series: Commands & Colors system. The units are moved on a game map divided into squares and depicting the battle field, and combat is resolved through the roll of 2 six sided dice. A secondary map provides the Venetian armies with an alternative path through the marshes, allowing them to outflank the opponents. The winner is the player that controls two of the three sections of the battle field.&#10;&#10;",

If a player rolls his own color, he moves and may then roll and move again.&#10;When a pawn arrives on an occupied space, it throws the other pawn out, back to the snail's shell where it must start again.&#10;&#10;From the last spaces on the spiral, a pawn advances to one of the 6 snail heads in their own color as soon as the player rolls that color. The first player to achieve this, wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

If the Leaders are the only pieces left on board it's a stalemate and the game is ended a draw. If one player cannot move any piece, or cannot move Leader to a safe square, that player loses the game.&#10;Players play one after the other like in chess(black goes first), but they can play not just one, but also two (and in special condition three) moves per turn.&#10;&#10;Each player on his turn can move any two pieces he has (but cannot move the same piece twice like a prolonged move). If he plays with a two units of a different type (e.g. one Infantry and one Archer), he can move even the third piece but that piece must belong to remaining unit (e.g. If a player moved one Infantry and one Cavalry, he can also move one Archer).&#10;&#10;Player cannot move and take pieces on the same turn. When taking pieces player can do it with only one unit (and so he loses maneuver advantage of playing with more pieces). The only way to take two pieces on the same turn is that you take one piece with either Infantry or Cavalry, and if there was any piece within range of your Archers, you can take that piece as well.&#10;&#10;Leader and Heavy Infantry are Invulnerable to Archers, but they cannot move on the square which is targeted by Archer.&#10;&#10;",

The entertainers of the type that Leader selected are scored (placed in a score pile) and the entertainers of the incorrect types are executed. Each of the 5 different entertainer types has a special ability and players can sacrifice them to affect scoring or Dear Leader's decision making.&#10;&#10;Game ends when there are no more entertainers.

The Vud&ugrave; tournament has just begun!&#10;&#10;In Vud&ugrave;, the players act as the most wicked and malicious sorcerers of all time, and they want to use their curses and black magic to make the lives of their enemies impossible to prevail over them! Each turn, you roll five dice, collect your ingredients, then choose whether to take new cards, take new items, or cast a spell. Each spell has a powerful and tricky curse attached to it that forces your target to play in a specific way, for example, talking with his tongue out for the rest of the game, or using only a single hand, or running around the table each turn. Each curse grants you points when you cast it and many more points if your target forgets to obey it or becomes too exhausted to continue. Collect as many malediction points as you can to reach the final tile of the scoreboard before anyone else!&#10;&#10;",

Now, for the first time, this classic game will be printed and available in North America.&#10;&#10;Excalibre Games is proud to release a Designer edition of this game with the highest quality components and enhanced artwork. Included are two decks of linen cards. Rules are in full 4-color and printed on thick gloss stock. The score pad is also on gloss stock. The box is specially UV coated both top and bottom.&#10;&#10;This Designer edition contains new cards with capabilities not found in the original game, yielding very different game play from the earlier edition. In addition, there are also promotional cards which are available separately.&#10;&#10;Overview&#10;&#10;3-8 players play detectives trying to arrest a villain. Secretly, one of the players is the villain, and the other players must try to deduce who it is and play an Arrest card to catch them. The villain's goal is to use all of their cards, and then discard their Villain card to escape. Players earn points for either making and arrest, or escaping as the Villain.&#10;&#10;",

It is fast to play and easy to learn.&#10;&#10;Each player is an evil goblin servant of the evil Dark Overlord (Rigor Mortis, the Master of all Evils), and all of them are gathered at the Dark Overlord's knees to explain why they brought that last important mission, ordered by 'His evil Excellence' himself, to failure again. Panic wraps you in its freezing grip, what can you do to save your poor skin? Could you say you are not the one to blame, but your inept companions?&#10;&#10;Yes of course, that's the solution! There is only one little problem: they've probably got exactly the same idea... and the Dark Overlord is not known for his mercy...&#10;&#10;This roleplaying game is all about telling lies and shifting the blame on your poor fellow ones, so the righteous Wrath of your Master can give them what they deserve!&#10;&#10;The expansion brings you new cards with places to explore, people to meet and treasures to retrieve. And that's not all... You, the goblins, will have new actions to make even more difficult your fellow party to escape the right Wrath of the Dark Overlord.&#10;&#10;",

The next challenge will be securing a marshmallow for your roasting stick. Take turns flipping cards until you get a raw marshmallow. Finally, be on the lookout for a toasted card to add to your stack to complete one of the three toasted marshmallows you need to make. But be careful because if your opponents turn over a rain, wind or roasted card, they can put out your fire or burn your marshmallow and you'll have to begin again!&#10;&#10;",

Someone rolls these dice, then everyone tries to be the first to come up with a word that fits the category and falls within the restriction of the dice (as not all dice will be rolled each time). The number on the syllable die indicates how many syllables the word must be; the forbidden die shows which letter cannot be used in the answer; and the two letter dice show a letter that should be used in the answer along with a point value.&#10;&#10;Whoever comes up with a valid word first scores the sum of the letter values for each appropriate letter in her answer times the points multiplier on the card, up to a maximum of ten points.

        "description": "On entering the wizard's academy, the new apprentices swore a solemn vow to learn the ways of magic, protect the institution, and uphold its values. Unfortunately most of them have failed to learn any significant magic in their first year. Susie coasts by on her natural talents, Malkar would sooner sell his soul for power than read a book, Nyvetta has forgone that option along with opposable thumbs upon accidentally turning herself into a bear, Flitter is only here to steal magic items to sell on the black market, and Bramblethrone spends too long talking to trees to get anything done. As a group of students, they could not be worse.&#10;&#10;Wizard's Academy is a co-operative game of magical experimentation for 1-6 players. In each game, the players select a scenario, such as summoning and binding a demon to steal its powers, defending the academy against an attack by an army of Imps, or (in the most difficult scenario) facing an academy inspector whom they must impress with their mastery of magic.&#10;&#10;Players move around the academy collecting glyphs in order to cast spells. At first, the effects of the spells are unknown, but as the players try new things, the students gain the power to manipulate the academy, the creatures within it, and the fates themselves &ndash; ideally achieving their goals before the monsters and elements that they've accidentally summoned reduce the building to smoking rubble.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Diner is a fast-paced game about waiters in a friendly competition to make the most money in tips. Take orders for the tables in your section, gather the plates to fill those orders, and serve your tables, and do it as quickly as possible while showing up the other players.&#10;&#10;Diner features a pseudo-real time mechanic that has players passing action tokens whenever they take an action; if a player does not have a token, that player can't take an action. At times, action tokens may accumulate in front of a player, allowing them to take multiple actions at once.&#10;&#10;Diner is the winner of the Dice Hate Me Games 54-Card Challenge - a contest that challenged designers to create a game using only 54 cards and very minimal components. It was selected as winner among over 100 participants.&#10;&#10;Additional description from interview posted at: http://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/28649/chris-kirkman-on-his-family-of-rabbits&#10;&#10;Diner puts players in the shoes of someone serving patrons at a greasy spoon. The goal is to earn the most in tips by gathering plates of various types from the kitchen and then serving them to a table of patrons in your section demanding certain orders. The real magic of the game is in the pseudo-real time action system.&#10;&#10;When you want to take an action - say, seat a table in your section - you have to have an action token in front of you. When you perform the action you pass the token to the player next to you. Sometimes those action tokens can pile up allowing you to do multiple things at once. Other times you&rsquo;re urging the other players to hurry up a bit so you can serve your tables.&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s a very madcap, social experience, with lots of table talk. With the action tokens, though, it&rsquo;s not total chaos like many real-time games - there is a lot of control worked into the mechanics. It&rsquo;s a brilliant design, and one that will appeal to many gamers whether they like real-time games or not. Guaranteed.&#10;&#10;",

Golomb in a talk to the Harvard Mathematics Club in 1953, which was later published in American Mathematical Monthly and in Scientific American.  Pentomino puzzles had been described before, but it was Golomb who coined the name and described a game for one to three players.  Others have published their own variations, but the game described by Golomb consisted of an 8 x 8 grid of squares and a set of twelve pentominoes.  Players take turns placing the pentominoes on the board, taking care not to overlap the pieces or to use a tile more than once.  The last player to place a pentomino on the board wins the game.&#10;&#10;Note: A separate database page exists for the 10 x 10 grid version of Pentominoes, as published by Taskmaster Ltd.&#10;&#10;",

Each team has an equal number of pawns that represent armies. One team represents Germany and the Austrian Empire. The other team represents France, the UK, Russia and their allies.&#10;&#10;The board is divided in a western and an eastern battle zone. At the beginning of the game, one player of each team plays in each zone. In the western zone, each player has 36 pieces. In the eastern zone each player has 24 pieces. The battles are played simultaneously, but separately (pawns cannot move from one battle zone to the other). When there is a victor in one zone, his remaining pieces go to his ally in the other zone.&#10;&#10;The movement rules are those of the game of checkers. Each players moves in turn. Armies move one space diagonally and capture by jumping over an enemy pawn. Each country has one or two squares that are marked as fortresses. Armies promote to 'generals' when they can occupy an enemey fortress. A general moves as a king in checkers.&#10;&#10;A battle in a zone is won by capturing all enemy pieces in that zone. The team that wins in both zones, or wins in one and draws in the other is the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;",

Once all 7 grams are in your hand, yell &ldquo;Holdin&rsquo;!&rdquo; For that round you receive the number of points that strain is worth. If you are &quot;Holdin'!&quot; with the Piece Card, this doubles your points for that round. If you are left with the Seeds Card, this deducts 20 from your points that round. First player to reach 420 points total wins!&#10;&#10;POT: The Card Game is a fast-paced, lively game full of frantic trading and bartering with other players. There are no &quot;turns&quot; in POT so you'll never have to wait your turn or forget who went last, etc. It&rsquo;s hard to believe how fun this game really is, POT will turn any circle or party into a special one and with 52 poker sized cards, including the rules, tucked neatly into one attractive box, you can carry POT anywhere!&#10;&#10;",

The water, however, surrounds the city and when it rises, you will great bodies of water form and the ever-disappearing streets will be impassable. What will the future of Venice hold?&#10;&#10;The year is 2099 and Venice is sinking. Players take on the role of art collectors and try to save as many treasures and artworks as possible. Strategic thinking is required to save the masterpieces. Gondolas are used to escape the floodwaters. The players move on floating platforms, wishing to avoid being in the part of town that is sinking...'&#10;The 8 by 8 board depicts Venice. At the start of the game, all land and bridge tiles are randomized in the plastic frame. Each player receives 3 tokens that they place anywhere on the board. All tiles have a value (higher numbers equating with higher value). Each player is also dealt 5-9 cards and receives 9 coins.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all dealt cards have been played. On their turn, players must play their lowest numbered card. The cards are numerical from 3-8.&#10;&#10;When playing a card, the tile that has the same number is flipped over to its water side, eventually flipping a tile with a player's token. Players use the two gondola cards, enabling them to rescue their tokens to another tile. The tokens excavate treasures by travelling to a specifically coloured tile and exchanging one coin for the corresponding coloured treasure.&#10;&#10;When all cards have been played, there remains part of the map that is not submerged. These remaining tiles are used to calculate the value of the treasures by rarity.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "There were mixed feelings among the few people in the British government or military high command who heard of Churchill establishing the SOE -- Special Operations Executive HQ. While many approved of the idea of consolidating efforts that had been scattered among at least four small, unfunded departments, not everyone agreed with the whole idea.&#10;&#10;Churchill's directive, &quot;Set Europe Ablaze,&quot; had grand sound to it, but many felt that the diversion of crack military personnel would be a waste -- Churchill's penchant for disastrous side-shows pre-dated Gallipoli -- while others wondered at the relative value and morality of arming civilians... something not recognized by the Geneva Convention. The fact that SOE took some of its ideas from the IRA's efforts in Ireland just emphasizes the shocking reminder that those we see as brave Resistance fighters might be viewed as &quot;terrorists&quot; through a different lens. Having seen how the Germans handled &quot;francs-tireurs&quot; in 1870 and 1914, none would suppose that these Germans would be less ruthless. But, faced with propaganda about the &quot;Thousand Year Reich,&quot; the Allies felt compelled to create a &quot;second front&quot; of some sort, long before Normandy.&#10;&#10;Set Europe Ablaze captures the spirit and complex choices involved in Occupied Western Europe. Award-winning designer John Prados, who last gave us Beyond Waterloo, again focuses on action in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. Prados brings us a card-driven game pitting the Occupying Axis forces against the combination of Allied intelligence efforts and brave local citizens, fighting the shadow war that made &quot;the Maquis&quot; a name to remember proudly.&#10;&#10;Unlike many board strategy games, the focus is not on movement and combat by military units but on political-economic strategy. The Axis player wants to extract as much raw materials and finished goods as possible, to aid the war effort, and the Allied player seeks to avert this. Allied tactics include sabotage, interdiction, and intelligence gathering.&#10;&#10;Axis responses include partisan sweeps, counterintelligence operations, and labor pool mobilization to repair damage. Turns abstractly represent about six months each, with rounds within each turn varying according to cards played. While there is no &quot;combat&quot; in a literal sense, there are competitions for resolving actions that have both players rolling dice. Excitement levels will be high, as players wonder what the next card will bring.&#10;&#10;Allies will take advantage of infiltration and special units (SAS, Jedburgh, OSS) while the Axis will use Security forces, the Abwehr, Gestapo, and even Vichy police. &quot;Barbie&quot; competes with &quot;Passy&quot; and &quot;Giskes&quot; versus &ldquo;Jean Moulin.&quot; There is even Stalag XVII.&#10;&#10;Set Europe Ablaze and the 2014 ATO Magazine Annual&#10;&#10;Maps - One full color 22&quot;x34&quot; mapsheet&#10;Counters - 176 colorful die-cut large 5/8&quot; pieces&#10;Cards - 48&#10;Rules length - 20 pages&#10;Charts and tables - 8 pages&#10;Complexity - Medium&#10;Playing time - Up to 3 to 4 hours&#10;How challenging is it solitaire? - Poor&#10;&#10;Design - John Prados&#10;Development - Lembit Tohver&#10;Graphic Design - Mark Mahaffey&#10;&#10;(from publisher's website)&#10;&#10;&#10;(Note: Read more about the game's development in Prados' article in ATO No. 38, Guns of the Askari.)&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "From the designer's website (used with permission):&#10;&#10;Aatheuo (pronounced like &quot;off-uh-you&quot;) is a tabletop game that was inspired from my love of Uno, Scrabble, and Rummy. 2 to 4 players take turns placing tiles from their hand onto the board, creating sequences and sets or three or more tiles. You win if you are the first player to have no tiles remaining. With more than 2 players, continue playing to determine runner-ups.&#10;&#10;The unique beauty of Aatheuo comes from the spatial-reasoning involved in re-arranging the board in any way, as long as all of the basic properties of the sequences and sets are maintained.&#10;&#10;Aatheuo was chosen as an Official Selection in IndieCade 2012, in addition to being featured as a night game at IndieCade. There are no concrete plans for bulk physical manufacturing of Aatheuo sets, but a digital version is in pre-production.&#10;&#10;",
