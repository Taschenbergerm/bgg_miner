Soon you'll have no place to stand; can you escape before that happens?&#10;&#10;In the solitaire game Flakes of Ice, you want to be standing on the last bit of ice after the rest of the glacier melts.&#10;&#10;The game consists of seven hexes, one that bears the game logo (which is placed in the center of the playing area) and six that bear three pairs of colored symbols (which are placed at random around the central hex). To start, you place a player token on the central hex.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you first move a hexagon by rotating it 60&ordm; in either direction, or by swapping it with a neighboring hexagon or the hexagon on the opposite side of the glacier (keeping their orientations the same in the latter case). You then move the player token from a hexagon to a neighboring hexagon or the opposite hexagon &mdash; but only if these hexagons are both connected to the central hex by the same colored symbol. (On the first turn, you move the player token from the central hex to any hex of your choice.) You then flip over the glacier hex that you left to show ocean water.&#10;&#10;If you can't move your player token legally, you lose the game; if you can move it six turns, then you'll be standing on the last piece of ice, victorious.&#10;&#10;",

Then to earn nuggets and fame every bartender must slide-launch the mug on the bar counter and land it in the correct zone to serve customers; but if too many beers land on the floor a fight may start.&#10;&#10;During the brawl phase if the dwarfs started fighting a bartender must sacrifice tables, barrels and dancers (based on how many beers are lost in the previous phase) to save his tavern.&#10;&#10;In the end of the nigh if the tavern is still standing the bartender gains a nugget for every beer that was served, if the taver has been destroyed, the bartender restarts his career from the beginning.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Loud About is a fast-paced party game of &ldquo;action memory&rdquo; that will make you and your friends do and say wild and hilarious things. It&rsquo;s ideal for both family parties and late-night shenanigans. Players must select actions and words to be loud about. The goal is to quickly ACT OUT and SHOUT OUT those actions and words faster than your opponents.&#10;&#10;Loud About is a new twist on the classic kid&rsquo;s game Menagerie from the UK.&#10;&#10;In each round of Loud About, a Topic Card is drawn, for example &ldquo;Dance Moves&rdquo;. Everyone at the table then chooses a dance move and an action based on that dance move. The key is to remember everyone else&rsquo;s dance move and action.&#10;&#10;On their turn, each player flips a card from the top of the deck, if the symbol matches with someone else card, a Face-Off occurs. In the Face-Off, the player who calls out and acts out the &ldquo;dance move&rdquo; of their opponent first, wins the card as a victory point. The player to collect the most victory cards wins the round.&#10;&#10;REVIEWS&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Your next favorite bar activity or party favor.&rdquo;&#10;&ndash; Ryan Smith (Red Eye Chicago Tribune)&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Like Anomia, a cafe favorite, but uses memory and personalization to make it unique! Something I would definitely recommend to customers.&rdquo;&#10;&ndash; Christen Traviss (Snakes &amp; Lattes)&#10;&#10;&ldquo;If Snorta and Time&rsquo;s Up had a secret love child, it might be this game.&rdquo;&#10;&ndash; Stephen Conway (The Spiel)&#10;&#10;AWARDS&#10;&#10;- Tillywig 2017 TOP FUN Award Winner &#10;http://www.tillywig.com/Toys-Games/Loud-About-A-Game-of-Action-Memory&#10;&#10;- Creative Child 2017 PREFERRED CHOICE Award Winner: Memory Kids Games Category&#10;http://awards.creativechild.com/product/639-loud-about-&#10;&#10;- National Parenting Center 2017 SEAL OF APPROVAL Award Winner&#10;http://the-parenting-center.com/loud-about-a-game-of-action-memory/&#10;&#10;",

        "name": "The Hunted: A Game of Medieval Magic, Mischief and Mayhem",
        "description": "The Hunted is a game which takes place in Medieval Times when fear of the supernatural was rampant. What&rsquo;s worse is that the supernatural could be hidden in any disguise a friend, a brother, a son. The community leaders would do just about anything to keep the seed of heresy from spreading in their communities. This incidentally, is where our &ldquo;heroes&rdquo; come in.&#10;&#10;Players are normal townspeople who have been given magical powers and abilities from a Mystical Benefactor. They have been given one objective in return for their newfound power: Chaos.&#10;&#10;They must take care however, if they are caught there are dire consequences for stepping outsided of society&rsquo;s boundries. Even if they manage to evade the notice of the authorities, the community will react in greater force to the strange happenings, the inexplicable bad fortune that seems to have befallen the town and the disappearances. Can our troublemakers complete their mission of disrupting a community or will they be rooted out by the powers that be? Will they become the hunters or... The Hunted?&#10;&#10;The Game:&#10;&#10;Mystical Benefactors&#10;There are currently 8 Mystical Benefactors to choose from for a given campaign. Each has their own special abilities and unique spells when they are active. This makes The Hunted have great replayability.&#10;&#10;Avoid Suspicion&#10;Players attempt to complete the objective, take down all three Authority Figures, while pretending to live a normal life. Players must pay taxes (10 Coins every Tuesday) and generally just stay out of trouble whilst carrying out their hazardous misdeeds.&#10;&#10;Chaos&#10;To grow stronger, players must commit disruptive acts upon the community to earn Chaos Points. Chaos Points are used to purchase Spells and Familiars (Animals bound to you by the Dark Benefactor that will obey your every order.) Chaos Points can be earned by:&#10;&#10;Destroying property Converting villagers to join your cult Sacrificing Animals and villagers Taking down Authority Figures And other generally blasphemous thingsPlayers can work together or separately to gain Chaos Points. However, at the end of one week, the player who has earned the most Chaos points is rewarded greatly by the Dark Benefactor, while the player who earns the least is punished. This adds an element of competitiveness to the general cooperative spirit of the game.&#10;&#10;Paranoia&#10;Should a character be noticed doing something strange, they will gain Paranoia Points. Paranoia Points indicate how suspicious the villagers are of that player being a heretic. Players will have increasingly harsh sanctions set against them as their paranoia score rises, such as the townspeople watching them more closely or their house being searched for heretical paraphernalia, eventually ending in their execution for heresy. Players can reduce Paranoia by doing things that are expected of them, like going to church or being a nice person, these things usually come at the cost of Chaos Points, bringing a delicate balance of Paranoia and Chaos that players must manage. Typically, it is best to be able to not be noticed or to be able to talk your way out of a dicey situation.&#10;&#10;Even if players do manage not to be noticed, villagers will begin to notice the unexplained happenings, the disappearances, and the downright spooky things that seem to be happening around them lately. The village itself has a Paranoia score that raises when something cannot be explained or something clearly supernatural happens. When this score rises, the Authority Figures become increasingly frantic to find and kill the heretics among them. Lowering the Town Paranoia can be difficult, so players must take care with their actions. If the Town Paranoia is too high, for too long, the village will be purged by the Church and the players lose the game.&#10;&#10;",

The questions are asked and the first answer is taken from the first player (up to 6 players) to shout out any of the numbers. If correct, they take that number to use as a &quot;pit stop&quot; in the Wonderwall (up to 3). If incorrect, they lose a number into the discard pile or if the player has none, they are out of the round.&#10;&#10;The host then picks a sheet of (both correct and incorrect) answers to place on the Wonderwall and hides them from view. The Wonderwall timer begins, the answers are revealed and the player is given 15 seconds to read all the answers, followed by three minutes in which the hosts reads up to 25 questions. Players must give an answer along with the number next to it to ensure they found the answer. If correct, they cross out the answer on the board and gain a point. At any time during the three minutes, the player may use a pit stop (up to 3) which allows the player another 15 seconds to read the answers.&#10;&#10;The next player (or group of players) then plays their turn on the Wonderwall.&#10;Play continues until a player wins by reaching a score of 49 points or by gaining the highest score after a set amount of rounds.&#10;Winning Lines is based on the UK game show of the same name.&#10;&#10;",

With two armies of equal strength, victory requires careful planning, precise maneuvers, and exact timing to take advantage of the opportunities offered by unexpected events. Will the British player be able to pounce on a fleeting French blunder to win the day (as happened historically), or will the French be able to simply bludgeon his opponent into submission? In Arapiles 20, the outcome of this famous battle is in your hands.&#10;&#10;Hans von Stockhausen's Bail&eacute;n 20 (July, 1808) showcases the stunning triumph of General Francisco Casta&ntilde;os&rsquo; Spanish army over French General Pierre Dupont&rsquo;s Corps d&rsquo;Observation operating in the mountains of Andalusia. This game challenges both players: The Spanish must struggle to coordinate the actions of their large and enthusiastic but mostly untrained army, while the French must decide whether to try and hold against superior numbers or conduct a fighting withdrawal back to Madrid. With Spanish guerrillas, a baggage train full of looted treasure, and treacherous Swiss mercenaries who might change sides in the middle of the battle, Bail&eacute;n 20 offers players plenty of military adventure.&#10;&#10;",

During set up, players customize their movement decks with a number of Ace cards based on their ship types.&#10;&#10;At the start of each turn, players simultaneously select one card from their hand for each ship. Cards are revealed in initiative order and that ship moves and attacks.&#10;&#10;The combat system uses d6, d8 and d10 dice - the exact pool comes from the attacker ship type and card used. Damage reduces shields and inflicts hull damage. Missiles roll a special die and may deal critical hits.&#10;&#10;Six scenarios come in the core set, and there are guidelines for expanding those scenarios or creating your own.&#10;&#10;",

The choice is yours in Risiko Transformers: Die Invasion der Decepticons, which puts players on the side of the Decepticons, who are invading Earth, or Optimus Prime and his Autobots, who are protecting the human race!&#10;&#10;The game starts with an inhabited human world with the Autobots in the center of the game board. The Decepticons invade from the four corners of the world, and as the game progresses they can take human slaves to repair and rebuild damaged units! Humans and Autobots always work together, but Decepticons can choose to ally with one another or fight amongst themselves. The survival of all depends on the Transformers' Energon &mdash; and once the stock is used up, the game is over!&#10;&#10;The objective of the game differs depending on whether you play the Decepticons or Autobots. The aim of the Decepticons is to conquer the Earth and enslave humanity. The more human slaves and territories controlled by the Decepticons, the more units they can send. The aim of the Autobots is to defend the Earth and ensure the survival of humanity. The more territories they recapture from the Decepticons, the more units they can send.&#10;&#10;Risiko Transformers: Die Invasion der Decepticons is being released on the 30th anniversary of the Transformers.&#10;&#10;",

Each meteor contained a monstrous, rock colossus that has come forth from its crater, hellbent on devastating the land.&#10;&#10;As dire as a threat these Colossi pose, more than a fight for survival emerged once the rare and powerful Cosmic Ores that compose their bodies were discovered. These special ores are capable of producing weapons and tools of uncanny properties. And so, those guided by greed, power, new order, and even peace (to keep this commodity out of the wrong hands) have quickly assembled bands of warrior-miners to harvest this extremely valuable resource from the Colossi. These warrior-miners&mdash;known as Veinreapers for their ability to crack apart the Colossi through their rich veins of ore&mdash;have been equipped with special Pickaxes forged from Metal Shards scattered by the meteors&rsquo; impacts&mdash;the only metal able to penetrate the coarse flesh of the gigantic creatures.&#10;&#10;You will play a band of Veinreapers fighting for the greatest share of Cosmic Ores. The outfit that mines the most ores will rise as the strongest power within Astralevia, taking control of the nation and winning the game.&#10;&#10;Summary&#10;&#10;Players will take turns placing Veinreapers in Kill Formations against Colossi on the game board while collecting Metal Shards and forging the special Pickaxe that their warriors are equipped with. Each Colossus can only be killed and mined by Veinreapers placed in a specific Kill Formation. The number of Veinreapers engaged against a Colossus and the properties of your warriors&rsquo; equipped Pickax determine how many Cosmic Ores you mine from each Colossus. The game ends when all Veinreapers have been placed and the player who mines the most Cosmic Ores based on these placements wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

In that time, the cave under which it slumbered has changed greatly&hellip;Goblins and strange monsters have filled its gloomy depths and there are whispers that the cave itself has begun thinking, shifting, and growing evermore dangerous.&#10;&#10;Still, stories of peril rarely overshadow the rumors of riches. And riches there may be&hellip; For where a dragon slumbers, there also lies a fiercely guarded treasure. Fortunately for the slumbering beast, malevolent crystals fill the cave&rsquo;s rooms with spectral light, hiding the entrance to the immeasurable treasure trove. Many have given their lives to the search and over the years the rumors have faded to legend.&#10;&#10;But the most courageous adventurers will not be discouraged by bloodshed. On this day, a knight steps into the darkness, her gloved hand gripping the hilt of her sword. Her years of quests--all of the victories and defeats--have led to this one final adventure. Knowing the kingdom can never truly be at peace with the dragon beneath the cave, she has come to make a final stand. Little does she know that she will awake everything that slumbers in the shadows&hellip; and begin the final battle in the darkness.&#10;&#10;Enter the world of Vast: The Crystal Caverns!&#10;&#10;Vast takes you and your friends into the torch light of a classic cave-crawling adventure, built on the concept of total asymmetry. Gone are days of the merry band of travelers fighting off evil. In Vast, you will become part of a new legend... Any part you wish!&#10;&#10;Play as the classic, daring Knight, the chaotic Goblin horde, the colossal, greedy Dragon, or even the Cave itself &mdash; powerful, brooding, and intent on crushing the living things that dare to disturb its gloomy depths. Each role has its own powers, pieces, and paths to victory...and there can be only one winner.&#10;&#10;As the ultimate asymmetric board game, Vast: The Crystal Caverns provides a limitless adventure, playable again and again as you and your friends explore the four different roles in different combinations. Play one-on-one in a race to the death between the Knight and the Goblins, or add in the Dragon and the Cave for deeper and more epic experiences, different every time.&#10;&#10;",

In Face Up Match Up place all cards face up on a table or smooth surface. Have an adult request a match. For instance, &ldquo;can you find the &ldquo;7s?&rdquo; Children can take turns or compete to see who finds the most matches. Or have the child pick up twelve cards in numeric order. For a more challenging game, turn the cards face down and play a memory matching game. Try to make matches by turning over two cards on each turn. If the cards match, take the cards. If they do not match turn them back over in the same place in the game. A challenging puzzle keeps the fun going for years to come.&#10;&#10;Why families love this item:&#10;Make learning numbers fun with a girl&rsquo;s favorite theme &ndash; princesses! Colorful dancing princesses adorn each card. Each card includes the numeral, the number word, and a physical representation of the number in symbol. The compact box makes this a terrific take-along item.&#10;&#10;",

Each die shows a word or phrase on it's face and the player must use the words to tell a story using the dice in front of her, in order: &quot;Did I tell you about...&quot; . During the story, other players can throw an &quot;interrupt&quot; die and read the result aloud. The active player has to adapt her story to the interruption: &quot;No, that's a lie!&quot;&#10;&#10;Once all dice have been used up, the player throws a six sided die that gives her her score. Other players decide if she is allowed to throw another die to get a better score. As the rule book says &quot;the scoring system is unfair, but life is unfair and this game... is life!&quot;&#10;&#10;Great fun for adults, and an amazing expression tool for children.&#10;&#10;",

By following the lead established by the first player, each player attempts to give away all of her cards before the other players can. The first player can lead a single card, a set of at least two cards of the same value, or a straight of at least two cards. The next players either pass or play a similar combination of cards (although not necessarily the same number of cards) that includes at least one card that's as low or lower than the lead player's low card. Whoever has played the lowest card once everyone has passed becomes the new lead player.&#10;&#10;Whoever runs out of cards first claims one of the available gift cards; whoever has the most cards left in hand must give a gift card to this round's winner! Whoever has the most gifts when the gifts run out wins.&#10;&#10;",

Every business&rsquo;s worth and location in Synergy are randomly assigned based on game play, which allows every game to be different. During the game, players will have the chance to acquire businesses, improve their net incomes, and build up the value of their businesses. Each player&rsquo;s goal during the game is to finish their career with the highest net worth, which factors in the termination value of the player's businesses and the assets they have acquired over their careers.&#10;&#10;Unique dice mechanisms are used to determine player movement and the net incomes of the acquired businesses and action cards are used to create significant shifts in the business landscape. Synergy allows a wide range of business strategies to be applied in a entertaining business simulation game. Each game of Synergy requires the player to assess the business landscape laid out during game play and make reactive adjustments to their strategy, just as they might in the real life business world. To add an extra layer of depth, the game is playable with two separate sets of rules - a Standard Version, for most players, and a Pro Version, for more experienced players who want a greater challenge.&#10;&#10;",

The missions are generated by rolling a handful of black dice to determine the difficulty of each part of the mission. By rolling their own player dice and with the help from the pirate crew, the players try to get at least the same amount of dice to each mission part to fulfill this part. Each part grants rewards and penalties, and each mission has another endgame trigger condition: Each mission gives a reward if the crew fulfills it and punishment if they don't. What's more, if pirates don't fulfill the mission, they also risk that the next part of mission will be more difficult because of the curse of the black dice. In the end, only the player who has captured the most amount of gold wins &mdash; that is, if the ship doesn't sink and take all players to the bottom of the ocean with it.&#10;&#10;Sail together to find treasures, board ships, plunder villages, or even kill the mighty Kraken...and betray the other players when they don't expect it. There can be only one winner, but all players can lose together!&#10;&#10;",

The farmer has all 12 of the transparent colored pyramids (plants), and the snail farmer has only the three black pyramids.&#10;&#10;All pieces start off the board, and each turn one player throws both dice, applying the roll to a single piece, which must be moved in a single track, from left to right and top to bottom, circling back to the beginning if it runs off the end. Smaller pyramids can be carried by larger pyramids that they land on top of. Same-sized pyramids can trap pyramids of the opponent. Larger pyramids can capture smaller opposing pyramids (or protect smaller friendly pyramids). Captured snails are available to return to play, while captured plants are removed from the game.&#10;&#10;The farmer wins by building a three-part tree of a single color, or by trapping all three snails. The snails win be capturing at least one piece of each color.&#10;&#10;",

This way he can try and clarify the various constructions and tactical maneuvers.&#10;&#10;The game is built of two interrelated parts. In one you will be admiral of the navy. On one side are the English ships that need to transport military units in order to to take over New Providence. On the other side is the pirate fleet trying to stop them.&#10;If the British army is successfully transferred to the island it will have to face the pirate band's to repel their attacks and conquer in time three forts that have strategic importance for the conquest of the island&#10;&#10;",

The last king of the House of &Aacute;rp&aacute;d, III. Andr&aacute;s is likely to be a victim of poisoning and the real power is in the hands of the most powerful barons, who rule as kings in their own realm. Waging war against each other, the country is essentially torn into several parts. Everyone is preparing for the final showdown... and the war has begun!&#10;&#10;The country is divided into six provinces, each ruled by a different baron and all they want is the crown. But only one of them can succeed! The game is about this decade, until K&aacute;roly R&oacute;bert consolidates his power. Diplomacy has a very important role, from the money you gather you have to bid on the offices of the Palatine, the Judge and the Treasurer. The game is immediately won, if someone manages to acquire all three offices, or the barons of the other players are defeated and killed in battle, or specified castles are occupied or rules 3-4 separate parts of the country. Lots of intrigue and bloody battles are waiting!&#10;&#10;We can call Sword and Crown the Hungarian version of the well-known game Risk, but with completely unique solutions, even greater game experience, with real battles, sieges, where only the size of your army and the dice rolls decide the outcome of a battle.&#10;&#10;Andr&aacute;s has died, with him the House of &Aacute;rp&aacute;d.

The battles that resulted from this escalating violence left quite a mark on the imagination and history of a modern-day nation unused to armed conflict.&#10;&#10;But most Quebecers today know little about what led to these events.  In the years before the rebellion, the demands for greater power for elected officials and for recognition of the Canadians' rights were at the heart of an ideological struggle between the Patriotes and a coalition loyal to the system in place under the British crown.&#10;&#10;&quot;Prelude to Rebellion&quot; depicts this conflict as a card-driven game using key events from 1834 to 1837.  Each player strives to mobilize the people of the various counties of Lower Canada and rally them to his point of view.&#10;&#10;Relive the history of the famous characters who shaped the province of Quebec in a strategic duel where each turn will bring plenty of unique tension and excitement!&#10;&#10;",

Head on over to the Jurassic Hunting Grounds to capture dinosaurs for your ranch by luring them with their favorite foods. Watch out for tar pits spreading on your precious land, reducing the number of dinosaurs that can live on your ranch.&#10;&#10;Fill your ranch with the most valuable dinosaurs to become the top rancher and win!&#10;&#10;In Dino Dude Ranch, players roll custom dice each turn in order to collect resources used to capture dinosaurs from the Jurassic Hunting Grounds. After dinosaurs are captured from the hunting grounds, new dinosaurs are randomly selected to replace them. Players continue to collect resources and purchase dinosaurs until all of the dinosaurs have been captured from the Jurassic Hunting Grounds or until one rancher has completely filled their ranch. Players' ranches will be filled faster if they roll tar pits during resource collection. These tar pits not only take up precious space that could be used for housing dinosaurs but they are also worth negative points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Players may also choose to purchase cards, which can be used to produce more resources, collect free dinosaurs, and add or remove tar pits from ranches.&#10;&#10;This easy to learn game is a fantastic introduction to set collection/resource management games and is designed to be engaging for families, gamers, and non-gamers alike.&#10;&#10;",

Luck is not determining because it depends very much on where to best move your stone. Each game of QUICK STEP is exciting and full of new contingencies to which you must respond tactically smart and clever.&#10;&#10;Quick Step is, as the name implies, a fast, quick lively game that invites to play several games in a row to determine the overall winner.&#10;&#10;Setup Quick Step:&#10;With 2 players, each player gets four double-sided pieces (green/red) and builds a tower with it. One player puts all the green sides face up and the other player puts all the red sides up. The towers are then placed in the big starting circle marked with red and green. &#10;With 4 players, the blue/yellow pieces are used also. Setup is the same, but blue and yellow start at the other big circle, playing then in the other direction.&#10;&#10;Playing Quick Step:&#10;Roll the Dice. Move one piece that shows your color. If you land on an empty space, turn your piece face down (now the color of your opponent is visible!). If you land on any other piece(s), don't turn your pice face down. All pieces under your piece are now blocked and cannot move until you move your piece away. If you roll a &quot;6&quot;, don't turn your piece face dawn, even if you land on an empty space.&#10;It may happen that your color is not visible when it is your turn. Then you just skip your turn.

        "description": "From the back of the box (translated):&#10;&#10;Fun games of logic and set theory.&#10;&#10;This game will make fun for all because of its many easy and difficult tasks. Here LEGO bricks can not be used as building blocks, but as a sign of thought content. Even children aged 4 to 5 years old want to learn thinking.&#10;&#10;Learning to think in the game. For children, gaming is the appropriate learning situation. That's why games are suggested in the book, whose &quot;rules&quot; trigger thought processes:&#10;The player discover Commons and Differents, draw conclusions, identify and apply rules, develop winning strategies, learn to calculate the probability of chance and the like. All this is amusing and fun, just by playing. Also competing games are in there ... and a portion hidden and open mathematics. The game manual is, however, completely without technical terms. IT is -  written for amateurs and still gives parents, kindergarten teachers and teachers' knowledge of logical and mathematical relationships and thus the background knowledge that facilitates the development of suitable game situations, which in turn develop and support basic skills for thinking of the children.&#10;&#10;User Summary:&#10;There are different &quot;boards&quot; included (paper with geometric structures printed on them)&#10;Instead of the figures, stacks of 2 to 3 LEGO bricks are used. There are multiple games which can be played on these boards or without a board only with the bricks.&#10;Included is a 96 pages book full with different games for the material included, and hints for which age and school grade they are adequate.&#10;Some examples for the games:&#10;&quot;Nine mans mills&quot; rule&#10;A pachisi game with changing blocking rules&#10;A logical rule guessing game: stacks of 3 colored bricks. Which rule is matching for all. e.g. exact 1 white brick in each stack.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Space, 2099.  Interstellar, black market commerce is commonplace. In Sector Beta-3, the search is on for minerals among the asteroids (endearingly called 'roids by you and your fellow miners). Your small mining craft will move swiftly through sixteen sub-sectors and collect six types of minerals, as efficiently as possible. The planets in the sector have different demands for minerals, so you must plan your movements and schedule accordingly. Even in this day and age fuel is an issue, and you'll have to call in a supply ship and pay with one of your completed contracts or convert uranium ore into fuel. Other minerals can be used for other purposes as well, although it's usually better to deliver them for profit&hellip; and don&rsquo;t forget to watch out for the Space Police!&#10;&#10;'Roid Miner is a light game with minimal rules which can be played seriously or as a beer-and-pretzels game. How is this possible, you ask skeptically? Because the game's design and mechanics lend themselves to &quot;planning/looking-ahead/what-if-he-does-that&quot; play  or &quot;instinctive&quot; play--or anything in-between. In other words, you can play 'Roid Miner in tournament mode or just for fun. Due to the random setup, every game will different. Sometimes you and your opponent will easily spot nice &quot;chains&quot; of pickup and delivery, and your scores will be high. In other games, both of you will struggle to make it into double digits. Sometimes you'll keep to yourselves and sometimes you'll &quot;have at&quot; each other. The best part is that no matter how the game unfolds, 'Roid Miner will always take only about a half-hour to play--and I'm betting you'll set it up for a second game every time.&#10;&#10;",

The board changes a lot during the turn instead of discarding unwanted ingredients back to the bag they are discarded to the cauldron. This burys ingredients that your opponent may need or burys ingredient(s) you are trying to make sure is safe for you to dig up later with a special Metamorph. Maybe you want to try and set up ingredients for a more complex potion hoping that it will still be there when it comes back around to you. Some of the potions allow it's maker to affect actions during the game.&#10;&#10;The first witch or warlock to complete the required number of potions ends the game. Each person tallies up the points of the completed potions and subtracts the points of the uncompleted recipes in their hand and whomever has the highest score can claim victory as the world's greatest potion maker.&#10;&#10;",

You are not the only one to have seen it; the other castes have noticed, so make certain you are swift to act. Through cunning and intrigue, and perhaps even diplomacy, navigate the unforgiving political realities of this new world to position your faction as the next ruling class.  Only one may be the Grand Scion of Empyrion; make sure it is you.&#10;&#10;Empyrion is a deck-building resource gathering card game where you compete against 2-5 rival Scions by gathering or stealing resources and shoring up your faction by recruiting specialized citizens to work for you or building unique buildings which confer long lasting and expansive powers.  Focus on building, or blocking your opponents building as you vie to gain enough influence points to claim the title of Grand Scion and ruler over all of Empyrion!&#10;&#10;",

The victory is possible only if all clans unite!&#10;&#10;But Scottish aristocrats often prefer personal enrichment to fighting for freedom. At the same time, King Edward I of England, nicknamed Hammer of the Scotts, pays generously to those who join his side!&#10;&#10;Each round, English army invades the lands of Scotland. Players take on the roles of Scottish clan leaders. They hire troops and send them to battle. Then each rival secretly decides which side he will support: England or Scotland. The Choice tokens are flipped simultaneously. Each side sums up their strengths (the traitors join the English army). Then the winning side of the battle is proclaimed.&#10;&#10;Swords and Bagpipes is based on the famous Prisoner&#226;&#128;&#153;s Dilemma. As a rule, treachery brings more gold. At the end, the richest player wins the game! However, if England conquers Scotland, the winner is not the richest player, but the player who had betrayed fewer times. Since Scotland can be defeated but not broken, its clans will need to rally around the most loyal clan!&#10;&#10;Remember the movie Braveheart with Mel Gibson? Freedom-loving patriots, corrupt aristocrats, and the cruelty of the English king. It's all there in the game, and it&rsquo;s what its participants will experience!&#10;&#10;",

At the same time, you want to keep as much material as possible to yourself but beware, if the ship sinks you may get the blame.&#10;&#10;The victory conditions are determined by the sum of all players' actions. If players add a lot to the ship, it will succeed but it is the player placing LEAST on the ship that will win. If, on the other hand, players add little to the ship, it will fail and the player placing MOST on the ship will win.&#10;&#10;The players start with cards representing goods at different values. Each turn, they may choose to place cards on the ship, inspect cards placed on the ship or replace own cards placed on the ship. When all four parts of the ships have been completed, the game ends and the ship is launched.&#10;  &#10;The challenge of Vasa Regalis is to correctly guess how much the other players add to the ship.&#10;&#10;The unique mechanism of Vasa Regalis is the ambiguous victory conditions. The players can analyze the piles and draw conclusions but never be sure how to win. Should they add as much to a part as possible or as little as possible? They will not know the answer until the ship is launched but then it is too late to do anything about it.&#10;&#10;",

As time goes by, one season replaces another in seasonal order; Spring is followed by Summer, Summer by Fall and Fall by Winter. However, you want to turn the time your way to have your season dominating the world.&#10;&#10;When all your season tiles have been played to the game board or you have a majority of season tiles in one area, your season dominates the world.&#10;&#10;The players take turn to play season tiles to one of six hexagonal areas, each of which has six season slots. The six season slots are arranged in a circle where each slot is adjacent to two other slots. The six areas are also arranged in a circle where each area is adjacent to two other areas.&#10;&#10;Within an area, season tiles must be placed in seasonal order. Between areas, season tiles must be similar. If they are not, the later season will replace the earlier (e.g. Spring will replace Winter).&#10;&#10;Besides placing season tiles, a player may turn one area clockwise so that new seasons end up adjacent to each other, resulting in one replacing the other. To really twist the time, a player may turn all areas counter-clockwise, resulting in several seasons replacing each other. However, since this turn is twisted, earlier seasons will replace later (e.g. Winter will replace Spring).&#10;&#10;Once a season is banished from an area, it may not easily return, so the players will gradually increase their local dominance until a global winner emerges. To win Turn of Time, you must find the turns that brings most of your seasons to the board while blocking your opponents' opportunities to replace your seasons.&#10;&#10;The unique mechanism of Turn of Time is the so called circular relation between the players where A is stronger than B, B is stronger than C etc. This mechanism, in combination with the revolving game areas, opens up in-numerous strategical paths. Should you accept being banished from one area to expand in another? Should you place your seasons so that they can attack easily or so that they are difficult to attack? Will the benefits of turning one or several areas outweigh the benefits other players may receive? Will you even be able to foresee all turns in the game if all areas are turned? You must find the answer yourself!&#10;&#10;",

The cards you buy can work for you on your turn and on all the other player turns, as well. On your turn, roll two dice and activate citizen cards with the result of each individual die and the sum of both dice.

The number of statet tricks is not allowed to be equal to the number of cards dealt to each player. So at least one player has to be wrong.&#10;&#10;Each round each player puts down one card.&#10;Colour order is Clubs -&gt; Spades -&gt; Hearts -&gt; Diamonds. If you have the starting colour of a round, you have to play it. Otherwise you're free to play whichever colour you want.&#10;&#10;In turns with just one card per player, you have to place your card, such that everybody else can see it, and state if you make the trick, according to the other cards you see.&#10;&#10;You will recieve 10 points if you statet your number of tricks correctly and 2 additionaly points for each trick, otherwise you will loose 2 points.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Capture: A Medieval Wargame is a game in which players use armies made up of Knights and Soldiers in an attempt to locate and capture one of the enemy crowns in enemy territory and safely return the crown to their home.&#10;&#10;Originally designed by first-timer Andrew Hunzicker way back in the 1980s, Capture was pitched to several big name companies but never saw the shelves. Only now is it seeing the light of day, having been given a beautiful makeover to help it grab the attention of gamers in 2015. Gameplay is in the style of &quot;Capture The Flag&quot; as you roll your dice to send your soldiers into the enemy's territory while also claiming cards from a deck that will hopefully give you the edge. Should you manage to steal an enemy crown, you'll race to return it to your own side of the board while also protecting your own, but watch out for the opposition forces that will swarm around you...&#10;&#10;Capture also comes with a unique element, adding a need for dexterity as well as strategy. Each game comes with a pair of catapults that allow you to fling boulders at the opposition forces, should you have the card that allows you to do so. Knocking out a soldier will send them home, but it's not just the enemy that's under threat - should your own forces get hit, you'll have to send them back as well!&#10;&#10;Capture is a game that works with a wide range of gamer types, from children who delight in hurling boulders across the board to take out their parents' pieces, to experienced gamers who want to take the strategy element to the next level, only occasionally throwing in the chaos of the catapult!&#10;&#10;",

Win enough Electoral College votes to become the next President of the United States. Careful campaign planning and management of campaign funds is required to defeat your opponent. Conduct polls to discover which candidate each state favors. Be sure to read the Daily News card and watch out for the &quot;Dark Horse&quot; candidate that can steal your Volunteers.&#10;&#10;To play Election, players first decide on how many &ldquo;days&rdquo; there are to the election, with each round of play being one turn.  On each turn players can either Fundraise or Campaign. When campaigning, players can spend money to recruit volunteers, hire consultants, buy ads, travel, or conduct a poll.  Volunteers, consultants and ads can be traded in for Votes, which are then placed on individual states.  Each state also has a &ldquo;poll&rdquo;, which determines which party the state favors (e.g. Republicans +3). Players can pay to conduct polls to see the polling information. On Election Day, the outcome in each state is determined by the votes placed on the state plus the polling. The winner of each state is awarded all of the Electoral College Votes for that state. The winner of the election is the player with the most Electoral College Votes.&#10;&#10;Election is fun for the whole family and will have your children jumping up and down thrilled to have just become the next President of the United States.&#10;&#10;",

Players are either Investigators trying to keep Cthulhu from waking and controlling the world, or Cultists that want to bring the world to a disturbing end.&#10;&#10;The game takes place over four rounds. The Investigators must uncover all the Elder Signs to win; the Cultists win when Cthulhu is revealed or if the game ends before all the Elder Signs are discovered.&#10;&#10;Before each round players receive a number of Investigation cards, which they look at but then shuffle and put in front of themselves so they know what cards they have, but they don't know which card is which.  Each round has a number of actions equal to the number of players in the game.  Players take actions to reveal Investigation cards, and gather all unrevealed cards are shuffled an redistributed evenly among the players.&#10;&#10;Reveal Cthulhu, and the Cultists win instantly.  Reveal all the Elder Signs, and the Investigators win.  If you want to play multiple rounds (it's highly recommended), the losers in each game get Insanity tokens.  Get three tokens, and the night is over with the winner(s) being those most sane.&#10;&#10;Kickstarter version notes:&#10;&#10;Kickstarter Edition has the following bonuses, unavailable in the retail version:&#10;&#10;#1 - 10 player aupport. All the components needed to play with up to 10 people at the same time.&#10;&#10;#2 - 3 x Necronomicon Investigation cards. Now the Investigators not only have to discover all the Elder Signs in time to prevent Cthulhu from rising, they must also discover the ancient tomes called Necronomicon. But the Necronomicon are dangerous to the uninitiated and cannot be revealed until at least one Elder Sign has been discovered.&#10;&#10;These promo cards add more information into the game, helping the Investigators in their quest. However the Necronomicon also give the Cultists another win condition - making the strategies more complex and the discussion even more lively.&#10;&#10;#3 - 6 x &quot;Objects of Power&quot; cards. These special cards have a variety of different uses, and provide more direct and indirect information in the game (as well as a touch of light-hearted fun). Objects of Power give the game more replay value, more strategy and more variability without adding complexity.&#10;&#10;Timebomb Themed edition&#10;&#10;In TimeBomb, you are playing either a terrorist trying to make a bomb blow up, or a SWAT team member trying to defuse it.&#10;&#10;Each player receives a card at the beginning of the game that indicates his role and keep it secret until the end of the game. Then, at each of the game's 4 rounds, each player receives 5 cards that he shuffles after having a quick look at them and place them face down in front of him. Among all of the player's cards, a number of &quot;SUCCESS&quot; cards, one &quot;BOOM&quot; card and the rest being &quot;SAFE&quot; card.&#10;&#10;The active player then chooses another's player card and reveals it, that player then becoming the new active player. After N cards have been revealed (N being the number of players), all cards are shuffled again and distributed equally to the players for a new round. If at any time the &quot;BOOM&quot; card is revealed, the terrorist's team wins. If all &quot;SUCCESS&quot; cards are revealed before that happens, then the SWAT team members win.&#10;&#10;Will you be able to convince the other player to reveal your own cards among them a SUCCESS is hidden ? Or are you just trying to cheat the SWAT team members into revealing your own cards because the BOOM card is among them ? Only a game of TimeBomb will say.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "At the dawn of the SMC age, the people were losing faith in an increasingly amoral society. Mother was developed to emulate human thought and emotion, to simulate human desires and aspirations, to better understand the rapid decline in morality. The citizens of Sapporo became the guinea-pigs for this technological experiment. A series of city-wide neural implant programs, dubbed &ldquo;the harvests&rdquo;, enabled the gathering of data directly from a person&rsquo;s cerebral cortex.&#10;&#10;Mother&rsquo;s neural net became more and more empowered by the collective thoughts of a city of souls. She soon became her own master, not just reading the minds of her citizens, but controlling them. Mother was in charge and the people were now her automatons.&#10;&#10;Only a few, the few who from fear, mistrust or in protest, avoided the harvests and remained untouched by Mother&rsquo;s influence. Like sewer rats they hide in an underground complex in Sapporo's Susukino district. While society at large became free from crime, free from poverty, free from emotion, without free-will or faith, from these few there came the criminals, the bootleggers, and the self-serving; the hungry, the frightened and the &ldquo;Renegades&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;Renegade is an abstract-euro thematic deck-building game for 1 to 5 players. You are a new breed of Decker - a Renegade. You will hack into a network of five servers, operated by one of four Super-Massive-Computers (SMCs). Each of these four SMCs have their own AI and increasing complexity to defeat.  You must survive a series of Countermeasure events before the network becomes overrun by Sparks and Guardians. Once you are jacked into an SMC&rsquo;s servers, with a profile bringing its own special ability, you will move across its partitions and fight to take control of the network by using informational, destructive, deceptive and cognitive attacks.&#10;&#10;Your Decker can seek upgrades (tools, software, apparel and information) by visiting the local bar, the &quot;Hack Shack&quot;. Once a fashionable hang-out for attractive young lovers seeking a voyeur's view of the city, it has now gone underground. An intimidating bar full of hit men and debt collectors, fixers and dealers, trading contraband from all across Sapporo, it's not the sort of place to take a date. This is where you will trade for new command cards, enhancing your Command Deck to become a more skillful Renegade.&#10;&#10;",

Let the bidding begin!!!&#10;&#10;Players start a round of play by bidding to hire an executive for their airline. All Executives are not made equal so choose accordingly. Then each player has an opportunity to invest in airline tech stocks, fuel stocks, or several other money making opportunities. This segment is also bidding based so budget wisely or your opponents might outbid you and steal your investment opportunity.&#10;&#10;Next Players buy their Airplane Fleets. This segment is Auction/Bidding based also. There are 4 airline tech companies providing 30 different fleet types, all with different money making abilities and fuel efficiencies. After this, Players must buy fleet fuel from the market in order for their fleets to operate. This market price is constantly changing so be careful when building your airline fleet or you might lose money.&#10;&#10;Players then have the opportunity to buy Terminals in Major and Minor Cities in a start to creating their Airline Empire. By creating connections players earn money if their fleet can fulfill the connections and have the fuel to do so. Each round ends with connection and investment profits being paid.&#10;&#10;A yearly market card is drawn that effects the next rounds game play. In AEROSTAR there are market fuel increases, Union Strikes, and many more global impacts. You never know what might happen in the adventure of becoming the next AEROSTAR.&#10;&#10;",

The board comes in two double-sided halves that can be fit together to form four different configurations. The assembled board displays a 6x6 grid, with each row and column marked by the face of a die. Six of the squares on the board (those with identical row and column numbers) are action spaces.&#10;&#10;Players purchase tiles that represent resources, such as food or animals, or buildings. These tiles are then placed on the game grid. On each turn, the active player takes one die chosen from among the dice rolled by the opponent, then rolls three remaining dice and may select one of those three. The player then resolves any actions or income produced from tiles on the board where the rows and columns corresponding to the two dice intersect. Any income may be used to purchase more tiles to be placed on the board.&#10;&#10;The players are striving to reach five specific goals. The first person to reach three more goals than the opponent (3 vs. 0 or 4 vs. 1) is the winner. If no one leads by three, the game ends when all 30 non-action squares on the game grid are filled, and the player who has obtained the most goals at that point is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

It employs hidden team affiliations, asymmetric player powers and inter-player combat using a rock-paper-scissors resolution.  In addition to the Mushrooms and Bamboo Shoots, each game also incorporates a set of neutral factions: so the agendas of each player are never clear.&#10;&#10;Players manage a hand of six cards: all different; each with a faction symbol (Mushroom, Bamboo Shoot or Neutral) in addition to the image of a rock, paper or scissors hand gesture. In a player's turn she may:&#10;&#10;    Pass a card from hand secretly to another player to inquire as to their faction loyalties.  For the most part, a player responds &quot;yes&quot; if their affiliation matches the card, and &quot;no&quot; otherwise.  Some player affiliations require a false response to any query!&#10;    Attack another player.  Both players select a card from hand, then reveal together.  If tied, another card is played.  Cards played are unavailable for re-use until all six cards have been played: at that point all are reclaimed.&#10;    Reclaim one played card to her hand.&#10;&#10;&#10;The various player powers affect the actions:  some are strong one-shot powers; others more modest powers that always apply.&#10;&#10;The game continues until one faction has achieved their victory.&#10;&#10;",

Players must wisely use their limited resources to bid on new animals and outmaneuver their opponents. Each animal you add to your zoo increases the number of visitors your zoo attracts, and ultimately the most popular zoo wins.&#10;&#10;Play is round based. Each round, players draw cards which might include money to bid on auctions or tricks to use against their opponents. New animals and powerful effects are then revealed and placed up for auction. Players get a chance to place blind bids on auctions that interest them and use their tricks to tip odds in their favor. Once everyone has played, the bids are revealed. It is important to bid wisely because losing bids are lost.&#10;&#10;Acquiring pairs of animals allows them to mate, produce babies and increase your visitor count for FREE. However, savvy zookeepers always have extra cash on hand to protect their investments from the dangerous cards that come up for auction.&#10;&#10;gadZooks! is fast and easy to learn which makes a great game for kids or non-gamers. However, there is enough nuance and strategy to keep more discerning gamers interested.&#10;&#10;",

Flair items range from the ordinary (a &quot;dinosaur egg&quot; or a &quot;steampunk gauntlet&quot;) to the outlandish (like the &quot;companion sphere&quot; or the &quot;ridiculous oversized hat&quot;).&#10;&#10;Easy to learn and play and incredibly portable, it's a perfect game to play when you're stuck in a hotel, at the airport or otherwise looking to have some fun.

The goal of the game is to have the best reputation for philanthropy and social justice.&#10;&#10;As in Monopoly, any player landing on an industry space owned by another player must pay the owner. However, a player may become &quot;the best in their industry&quot; by giving up their move and paying 2,000 in currency to purchase a ring. When a player lands on an industry space with a ring, the owner of that industry must pay the active player. This represents the social responsibility of being the best in an industry.&#10;&#10;To win the game, a player must have four rings on four different industries he owns. He also must land exactly on the Charity Shop space and pay 2,000 in currency.&#10;&#10;",

At the end of the game, the player with the most Treasure Triangles is the winner!&#10;&#10;Set Up&#10;1) Decide on four locations around your house to place Treasure Triangles (for example, the kitchen, bedroom, dining room, entry way). These are the places you'll &quot;fly&quot; to!&#10;2) In each location, place six Treasure Triangles as shown. (Wedges meet to form a hexagon).  It does not matter which sides are face-up.&#10;3) Everyone  sits in a central location. &#10;4) Put all the square Cards inside the bag.&#10;5) Have the sand timer handy.&#10;&#10;The player with the next birthday goes first!&#10;&#10;On Your Turn:&#10;Reach in the bag and, without looking, pull out a Card.  Follow the instructions below based on what kind of Card you pulled:&#10;&#10;     Picture Card&#10;&#10;&#10;If you pulled a Picture Card, look at the items on both sides of the Card.  Choose one of the sides to place face-up in the center of all the players.

If the fourth Moon Card is pulled and the picture of the full moon is complete, the game is over (see Ending the Game section below).  Otherwise it's the next player's turn.&#10;&#10;     &quot;Fly and Go Seek&quot; Card&#10;&#10;&#10;If you pulled a &quot;Fly and Go Seek&quot; Card, follow the directions below:&#10;1) Take a look at ALL the face-up Picture Cards.  Try to remember the items on them, but leave them where they are.  (Note: if there are no face-up Picture Cards then your turn is over because there are no items to seek, and now it's the next players' turn.)&#10;2) Flip the sand timer over and go!&#10;3) Hurry to the Treasure Triangles around your house.  If you see items from face-up Picture Cards on any Treasure Triangles take those Treasure Triangles, take those Treasure Triangles with you.&#10;4) When the sand timer runs out, another player should let you know. Immediately come back with any Treasure Triangles you have collected.&#10;5) Compare the Treasure Triangles you have collected to the face-up Picture Cards. Place each treasure Triangle you have collected that matches a Picture Card in your own scoring pile. Set the matching Picture Cards out of the game.&#10;6) If you collected a Treasure Trinagle that does not have a matching face-up Picture Card, put the Treasure Triangle back and your next turn is skipped. Now it's the next player's turn.&#10;&#10;Ending the Game&#10;When the fourth Moon Card is pulled from thebag and the picture of the full moon is complete, the game is over.  Players count up the Treasure Triangles they have collected. The player with the most Treasure Triangles wins!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The year is 1600. You've been appointed Governor of a small struggling settlement in the New World with instructions to explore and settle these new lands for the Glory of your King and country. However, your nation is not alone in these new lands. For your colony to survive you will have to bargain with the powerful Native tribes and deal with your Nation's enemies who also have settlements here.&#10;&#10;The New World is a 4x tile laying game for 3-4 players set in Colonial North America. Players can either play the French, English, Spanish, or Dutch with the goal of building your empire and collecting Glory for the Crown. Since each game will feature random exploration by laying tiles, no two games will play the same. &#10;You will win this game by exploring, building your settlements by claiming and purchasing land from the Native tribes, and eventually coming into conflict with your country's competitors in the New World. All this will build up Glory Points in the name of your King.&#10;&#10;The game plays quickly with each player on their turn having a choice of a single action from either:&#10;&#10;1) Exploring: Paying to launch expeditions to place tiles, claim/purchase land, and placing influence markers (representing traders and missionaries) in the hopes of Allying and trading with the tribes.&#10;2) Economic Turn: Building up your Colony by creating new settlements, building Forts, repairing settlements that were damaged, maintaining troops, and collecting wealth from taxes and trade &#10;3) War: Eventually you will have to deal with the enemies of your King here in the The New World. If you choose this action this is where you will raise your armies and send them across the frontiers. Be forewarned though. War is not cheap. You will need a strong economy to wage successful war. There is only so much that the Crown can do to help your fledgling colony.&#10;&#10;The New World is buffed by a large Event deck that brings out the historical events of the times. It also serves to pace the game by having Events that represent the Peace Treaties that ended the big European Wars that spilled over into North America. Whenever a Peace Event is drawn, there will be a few turns of truce and Glory Points will be awarded based on the number of Settlements, the number of claimed territories, and by your Alliances with the Native Tribes. Once 3 Peace Events are drawn the game will be over.&#10;&#10;This game is rather unique by it's Exploration/Tile laying mechanic, it's quick engaging turns, it's streamlined easy rules including a nice combat resolution, the ability to bounce back from a disaster, and and a unique, more historical, representation of the native tribes.&#10;&#10;",

It&rsquo;s time to begin Prison Run!&#10;&#10;In Prison Run, each player tries to bail his companions out of jail. The cards with the list of prisoners who are the members of the player&rsquo;s gang should not be revealed to the other players. To make escape of their people possible, the players use simple actions. They can choose the prisoner who will break out from the cell or who will be move forward on the escape track. If one of the prisoners will make it to the last space, the players votes secretly if the prisoner will successfully escape or will go back to the cell. If at least one of the voters is against the escape, the prisoner returns to the jail. However, the players have to be careful and count their odds, because each player has limited amount of the objections.&#10;&#10;The player who at the end of the game has the largest number of bailed out prisoners from their gang is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Each player in turn puts a card on the table, trying to put them in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.&#10;&#10;If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.

Use espionage, investment, and your loyal armies to expand your kingdom and achieve ultimate glory in this portable, quick, and easy-to-learn war based card game -- the only card game of its kind. Get it now and travel back in time ... to the Age of War!&#10;&#10;Age of War card game from Battle Born Games is a medieval era, war-based card game that plays like a board game. Conquering land is the name of the game, and you can do this through battle and espionage. Along the way, enhancing your empire with cities and castles will help you accomplish your goals. You only have three actions to use per turn though, so you must carefully decide how best to use those actions with the cards available to you at that time. Here's briefly how it works:&#10;&#10;(1) The player draws cards to start the turn.&#10;(2) The player then takes action!  This is when you play a card to the table, wage battle, and/or upgrade a city or castle.&#10;(3) After the player completes his actions, one army card may be moved from any territory to any territory within his empire.&#10;The cards:&#10;(a) Territory cards are central to the game. You want land above all else, and you'll do anything to get it!&#10;(b) Building cards can be added to any kingdom in your empire, and there are two types of building cards -- castle or city.&#10;(c) Army cards can be added to any territory or group of territories in your empire, and they attack and defend in battle.&#10;(d) Money cards will pay for upgrades to buildings, buying elite army units, and paying off enemy agents.&#10;(e) Mission cards have various purposes, all designed to help you win the game.&#10;Once you've amassed enough land to prove your dominance over every other king in the world, you win the game!&#10;&#10;",

Obstacles include things like The Bridge of Doom, Potato's House, The Beach, etc. Along the way, players will be instructed to drink, pick cards, and answer slightly humorous questionnaires out loud to the other players. It is designed to be interactive, socially and physically, within the players.&#10;&#10;This game boasts 8 pawns in a range of colors, and one blue die, all neatly packed into a drawstring canvas bag to withstand the tests of time longer than the typical heat-sealed plastic bag most games include. This means your pawns and die won&rsquo;t be rolling around aimlessly inside the box once you open them. (Our pawns are made in the U.S.A. They are eco-friendly, filled with postindustrial wood trim.)&#10;&#10;This game includes 52 Beer Cards and Bong Cards collectively, which are packed into a playing card box. Our cards are water-resistant and should clean off pretty easily if wet.&#10;&#10;This game can be played while easily substituting alcohol with any beverage, using alcohol is an OPTIONAL part of this game.&#10;This game is meant to be played by those of legal drinking age, and is prohibited to be played by any minor. Some tiles include curse words, obscene ideas, and some offensive language and graphics in general.&#10;&#10;",

Goods are also sold to an open market where players set the price to finance more armies.&#10;&#10;Players can also trade any of their resources with any other player at any time. Empire offers completely free, open and unfettered trading and diplomacy. Empire's turn-less simultaneous action selection system allows negotiation and exchange to integrate smoothly into the game flow.&#10;&#10;Empire is fast-paced and filled with tense decisions, negotiation, and trading.

        "description": "Kaiju Conquest is a strategy wargame depicting the battle for Earth in 2116 AD, with the First Inter-Species War between the humans of the United Earth Reaction Force (UERF), and the reptilian Sazzarran Empire.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to have the most Victory Points based on control of damaged or non-damaged city and land zones by the end of game round five.&#10;&#10;The initial invasion began in the Pacific Ocean and its bordering coastlines, which is also portrayed on the game board. There are 15 major coastal city zones and 7 land zones, which were involved in the war of the Pacific Campaign. The cities are beautifully illustrated by the artist, Becca T-R.&#10;&#10;The game contains eight Mecha characters of eight different designs well as 8 kaiju characters of eight different species, including the Warlord, who is the Supreme Commander of the Sazarran invasion force. Fighting along with and supporting the mecha are Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine forces combined into a common Military Unit (MU). The Sazzarran have their own version of Army, Air, Sea and other special units, also combined as a Military Unit. The UERF also have access to nukes and the Sazzarran have bio-bombs.&#10;&#10;There are five game rounds. In each game round the players will receive a fixed number of Resource Points to build their MUs and respective Mecha and Kaiju. Each game round the Resource Points are two points less than the previous game round, starting with 15 points and ending with seven points. At the beginning of each game round, the players may also have received extra Resource Points by destroying the opposing players forces.&#10;&#10;There are five phases during each game round.&#10; 1. Maintenance Phase: One of the players will move the hexagonal game round token to the next game round hex space. Both sides will then collect the number of Resource Points (RPs) as shown below the current game round number.&#10;&#10;2. Draw Phase: Both sides randomly draw six cards from their respective Tactic Card decks. These cards can be used during the Draw, Resource, Movement and Battle Phases to give bonuses respectively to each of those phases. The Sazzarran player then draws four Target Zone Cards. These cards display a particular city, a land or a sea zone. The Sazzarran player chooses two of the cards and the other two are discarded under the Target Zone deck. The two chosen cards will be the zones where the Sazzarran MUs and Kaiju will deploy.&#10;&#10;3. Resource Phase: The UERF will purchase their MECHA and MUs as well as any Nukes for the current game round, based on the number of RPs available. The Sazzarran will also be purchasing their Kaiju and MUs. The Sazzarran will also be deciding which zones the Kaiju and MUs will deployed into during the Movement Phase.&#10;&#10;4. Movement Phase: The Sazzarran deploys their forces first at the designated target zones. If there are any UERF units in the zones, the Sazzarran must leave one MU for each UERF MU in the zone. Mecha and Kaiju can freely move between zones within their movement allowance, unless there is an opposing Mecha or Kaiju in the zone. If the zone is unoccupied, the Sazzarran can split up their Kaiju and MUs to take more zones in an attempt to damage and potentially destroy the cities and land zones.&#10;&#10;Once the Sazzarran has moved any or all of their units, the UERF counter moves their forces to a zone occupied by Sazzarran forces. Both sides may also attempt to blockade each other using the city, land and especially seas zones, to block movement from one zone to another.&#10;&#10;5. Battle Phase: The players will battle for control of city, land, and sea zones. Each battle in a contested zone results in total elimination of an opposing force, unless they choose to withdraw after each battle round in that zone. All contested zones must be resolved with a battle. Once the last battle is fought, the game round ends. At the end of each battle in a zone, the players will receive Resource Points based on the build cost of the opposing unit destroyed. These Resource Points are tracked on the players Resource Trackers on their side of the game board.&#10;&#10;At the end of game round five, the players will calculate their Victory Points (VPs. The Sazzarran receive one VP for each damage point on a city or land zone. The UERF receive one VP for each city or land zone that still have any Zone Points (ZPs) remaining. Both sides receive a VP for each zone occupied by at least one of their units. Both sides also receive VPs equal to the number of RPs they have remaining on their respective Resource Point Tracker. The side with the most Victory Points wins the game and will most likely have control of the Pacific Ocean and its coastal cities and land zones.&#10;&#10;",

Some are tricked out imports from Japan, others are pure American muscle, and someone has brought the latest European beauty. Not all of them will take to the street tonight, but some will be putting it all on the line for a mix of cash and respect.&#10;&#10;This is a game of making the cool-headed move or spinning out of control! Drive smart and smooth by managing your hand of cards well, or look for an edge, take a risk, and bank it all on one flip of a card! Either way, full throttle speed is the goal because you're a driver with special talents. You've souped-up your car with all manner of upgrades. This race is yours!&#10;&#10;Fast &amp; Furious: Full Throttle is a game of hand-management. Discard cards to change gears, play sets of cards to move and have your hand size decreased through speed penalties.&#10;&#10;",

Weakened by the resurrection, they grow stronger during their story-driven quests. By acquiring soul points during battles, the heroes' souls regenerate, restoring their legendary status with multiple powers, magic and soul weapons, and powerful artifacts.&#10;&#10;Designed by Gremlin Project (the same team who created Galaxy Defenders),  the game system in Sword &amp; Sorcery represents the perfect evolution of its forerunner. Gameplay is faster and dynamic, thanks to an innovative area movement and area control system, with new features never seen before in a game of this category.&#10;&#10;Key features of Galaxy Defenders are also preserved in Sword &amp; Sorcery, such as the advanced AI system for monsters, a high degree of character customization, and the multiple tactical options during battles. Sword &amp; Sorcery packs, in a top-quality board game format, all the excitement of the best MMORPGs and action RPGs, to provide the ultimate heroic fantasy board game adventure.&#10;&#10;This base game contains ACT I of III.&#10;&#10;",

Each player controls a squad of up to 12 soldiers and can play in many different scenarios and combat situations. Each counter represents a single man, each hex 2-3 meters, and each turn 10-30 seconds. Games take from 45 minutes to a couple of hours.&#10;&#10;The Razor's Edge is entirely free and open source. Players may use the rules, components, and artwork to create their own scenarios, nationalities, new units, or entirely new games.&#10;&#10;Scenarios include patrols, night actions, partisan raids, rescuing downed airmen and many more. In each scenario the actual soldiers used are randomly selected, so whether you end up with outstanding soldiers or the less than first rate soldiers, you will need to marshal your squad and use their abilities to the best you can.&#10;&#10;Nationalities included in The Razor's Edge are:&#10;&#10;    British, steady under fire, but sometimes hidebound by their training methods&#10;    American GIs, always full of individual initiative, but sometimes not with the best fire discipline. &#10;    The Germans are really a mixed bag by mid-1944, there are some very seasoned soldiers along with many that are very inexperienced.&#10;    The French Resistance, the men and women of the Resistance may not always be the best prepared but they try to always take on the Germans when they have a clear advantage.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Each weapon and enemy rolls a single dice, and their power varies depending on the number of sides to the dice, from d4 to d20.  Each victory is rewarded with a number of gold pieces.&#10;&#10;When someone gets close to leaving the Lost Woods, the Guardian appears to block the way, and provide a large amount of gold for anyone who can beat them.&#10;&#10;The game ends when someone finds a way out of the Lost Woods.

It's huge enough that the people who formulate the drugs and the people who pitch the drugs don't really talk to each other, so don't be surprised when the person pitching your company's drug is just as surprised as everyone else when she sees what it actually does...&#10;&#10;Each card in the game has a little bit of a drug name, a little bit of a description, and a side effect. There will be one card dealt in the middle of the table; its side effect is the malady to cure this round.&#10;&#10;In a 3-4 player game, each player gets seven cards, and chooses three cards for their drug names and two cards for their descriptions. Once everyone has chosen their cards, everyone pitches their drug in turn. While one player is making his pitch, the other players pass a card to the pitching player. The pitching player chooses one card to incorporate into his pitch as a side effect, and explain why it's not as bad as it sounds. The player whose side effect got chosen gets a point!&#10;&#10;In a 5-8 player game, players split off into teams. One player on a team gets six cards, and chooses three cards for their drug names, two cards for their descriptions, and one card for its side effect. He passes them all face-down to his teammate, who won't see the cards until she starts her pitch!&#10;&#10;After all players have made their pitches, everyone votes on their favorite drug. Players score points for getting votes, and teams rotate every turn. The player with the most points after four rounds wins!&#10;&#10;",

Each player receives four markers, which are one color (red, yellow, blue or white) on top. All markers are green on the bottom. Players roll a single D6 and move any one of their markers the total count on their turn. Markers can land on top of one another, and, in so doing, trap opponents' markers, or their own until the top one is voluntarily moved off the stack. If a player's marker lands on the white spaces (in the water), that marker is turned into an island (green side up) and is stuck there, able to be used as a stepping stone for other players, for the duration of the game. The marker(s) that reach ELDORADO are stacked in the order that they reach there. Final score is highest for the top marker (last to arrive) and decreases for those lower in the stack. The winner is decided by the player whose marker(s) score the highest total points in the final stack.&#10;&#10;NUMERI:&#10;Each player receives six figures of the same color, numbered from 1 to six. The number on the dice signifies the figures to be played. A player must move figures totaling to the amount shown. If he rolls a six he can move as an example pawn number 2 and pawn number 4. They always move to the next free space that is available on the board.&#10;If the player succeeds in making a chain - that means 3 or more pawns in a row he rolls the dice again.&#10;The game is finished when the last three, specially marked squares are occupied. Each player receives the number of points achieved by multiplying the number of the square by the number of the occupying pawn.&#10;&#10;",

If you rolled green on the other dice, you draw and execute an event card after moving. You draw no card if you roll red. The event card tells you either to put a number of your money chips into the middle of the spinning wheel or to spin the wheel in clockwise or counter-clockwise direction. Thru spinning the wheel, the pawns may slide in (to the center of the wheel) or out. To end the game, the last space of the target way has to be reached exactly.&#10;&#10;",

You have three nations to choose from &ndash; the conservative British, the offense-inclined French, and the extremely effective Germans. Each nation has a different battalion structure, and thus a different set of tokens representing units and nation cards that you play in the game. Your task will be to get as many victory points as possible, which you receive from carrying out orders. This, in turn, determines which fields in the enemy&rsquo;s system of trenches must be occupied only temporarily, or kept completely. The battle takes place on a board representing both players&rsquo; network of fortifications, separated by a narrow strip of No Man&rsquo;s Land.&#10;&#10;Piek&#197;&#130;o Okop&oacute;w lets you feel the excitement of giving commands in order to get a few meters of land that are bought with the blood of thousands of soldiers. The game&rsquo;s mechanics allow you to use successful tactics employed by the commanders of the Great War. You will use artillery preparation, gas attack, try flexible defense, or the use of fire to take enemy trenches.&#10;&#10;A separate publication included with the game reveals the secrets of trench warfare in the First World War.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Reclaim Oz is a nontraditional deck building strategy game that takes places in a Dystopian Oz overruled by Four Witches.Reclaim Oz is unlike other deckbuilding games because of the combination of PvP elements and a limitation to the size of each players deck. It is a unique tabletop experience that has the play differently than any other games in the same genre.&#10; If you didn&rsquo;t know already, the game takes place in the Wonderful Land of Oz, but at a time when it wasn&rsquo;t so wonderful. All the great Legends of Oz have disappeared, and four Witches from the Silver Islands. While L. Frank Baum may have written a much happier world, this is still the same place, with all the characters and places you know in love&mdash;but in a time of great terror. The game consists of animals, beasts, and mythos&mdash;it is your task to get the World back to the way it once was, with the characters you know and love. If you are able to compile the best deck filling each of the four categories (HEART, COURAGE, BRAIN, HOME), you win!&#10;&#10; &#10;What makes it different?&#10;&#10;    Consisting of a 90 Card Deck&#10;    And a Completely New Card Playing Experience&#10;    Reclaim OZ with your cards in hand&#10;    Defend your Deck from the Evil Witches of OZ&#10;    Find a New Ruler to Lead Ozonians back to Prosperity&#10;    Rescue the Legends of Oz and take Back the Emerald City&#10;&#10;&#10;The one thing that makes this card game different than a traditional deck building game is the lack of currency and ability to purchase cards. The cards are given to you each turn, Cards are marked with symbols letting you know how they are used in the game, the symbols include: Heart, Courage, Brain, Home, and Wicked. All of these cards are used in different ways. *All Card Designs Are Subject to Change&#10;&#10;&#10;How to Play&#10;Each Player is dealt 5 Cards. During their turn they will play two cards; one card face down in their vault and place one card face up in their discard pile. Another option is to play an action card against another player in replace of playing a card in their vault--this will trigger a PvP event giving the attacked player the option to play a defense card in return. These cards become Trash and not played again. If you choose to Vault instead of Attack, please note the vault card is safe from play and will go towards your final deck at the end of the game. The only cards that can harm your Vaulted Cards are Witch Cards. Cards present statistics and points, Each card is given a value in the form of gold bricks called Road Points the higher rated the card the better it will serve you in the end game.&#10;&#10;The Game Board includes places for the following:&#10;&#10;HOME: Cards that are played against or in defense&#10;&#10;BRAIN: Ruler/Legend/Key Section (3 Cards per board)&#10;HEART: Foundation Section (3 Cards per board)&#10;&#10;COURAGE: Ozonian Section (3 Cards per board)&#10;WICKED: Curse Section (1 Card per board)&#10;&#10;&#10;Throughout the Game you must build your Deck via placing it on the Game Board, once an item is placed--it&rsquo;s there until the game ends.&#10;&#10;Each player can have up to nine cards on their Board and one card can be given to them as a curse, making each deck build a total of ten cards. When a player is cursed the card is played face down on their Game Board the player does not know what curse is given to them until the final tally.&#10;&#10;Witch/Curse Cards are used to play against other players in order to damage their vaults. Curse cards can be played toward another player by placing it on the Player you want to curse, each player can only be cursed once and it cannot be taken back or discarded. Witch cards are PvP actions that will cause a player to be affected. That player can use what is in his or her hand to replenish their board, in case of the attack ending the game.&#10;&#10;If at any time the player must draw a card from the main deck, but the deck is empty, they shuffle their discard pile and use it as their personal deck. for the remainder of the game.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all four witches have been played, Witches can not be discarded but played into their discard pile that will affect one or all players  in the game. To play a Witch Card place the character face up on the table and explain the action that must take place, some witches have you attack single players while others affect everyone in the game. The Witch Cards play a pivotal role in the gameplay and can only be diverted if a Defense Card in Hand is playable and not vaulted. All Witch Cards caused whichever players/cards affected to be Trashed and will no longer be used in gameplay.&#10;&#10;Once the game ends and the cards on the Game Board are tallied, the winner has the most Road Points in their Vaulted Deck is the winner. In the result of a tie the player with the highest Road Point Legend is the Winner.&#10;&#10;Nearly all cards but Witches/Curses have double or triple uses, for Example Quox the Dragon can be used as an Attack card or as a Courage Board Card saved face down on your personal game board. Because of the value of that card, he can be used as a great boost on your Final Game Points&hellip; However as an attack card he can significantly harmful to another player, giving you the advantage. The cards you choose to save on your Board impact your final score--it&rsquo;s up to you to choose how to play your cards.&#10;&#10;Each Card has Road Points value that is tallied at the end of the game to determine the winner, but high Road Point Cards may not want to be vaulted due to their Additional Properties--such as saving you from Attack. Road points are the the key to a 'Victory'.&#10;&#10;Curse cards, which are like the other cards, but have a negative Road Point value that counts against the player at the end of the game. It is uncertain which curse is given to a player until the end count.&#10;&#10;Defense cards, though they may have a high Road Point Value and can double as Assist or Support in your Vault, will usually be kept in hand in order to be playable (though Trashed) in order to save other cards in your deck.&#10;&#10;Attack cards generate effects during a player's turn, allowing that player to Attack another players hand or rarely their vault cards. Witches are considered Action Cards because they attack every player and usually the Vault (which in some cases will affect the game drastically). Defense and Action cards can be played each turn unless the player chooses to Vault a Card instead of using it as an action. Welcome to Oz...&#10;&#10;",

It's portable and meant to be taken to dinner with you, played between the time you order and when your food arrives.&#10;&#10;This is a family-friendly dice game that takes 5 minutes to learn and 15-20 minutes to play. It is suitable for 2-10 players and can be learned by children as young as 5 years old. It fits in your pocket and travels well, so it makes a great game to leave in the car, take to the laundromat, take to dinner with you, or pack in your carry-on luggage.&#10;&#10;Rules&#10;Each player rolls 5 randomly selected dice, separating the Knights, Villagers, and Barricades, as well as any special dice. Barricades get rerolled, drawing up to 5 more dice to roll each turn.&#10;&#10;You may stop any time and return to your lair, eating the number of Villagers on the board. That number is added to your next turns, until you have 15 or more, and are full, winning the game.&#10;&#10;5 Knights vanquishes the dragon, ending your turn with 0 points.&#10;&#10;If you roll a Wizard (one of the specialty dice), he casts his Magic if and only if 2 Knights are on the board to protect him. Wizard's Magic vanquishes the dragon, ending your turn with 0 points. Without 2 Knights, he counts as a Villager.&#10;&#10;If you roll a Dragon (the other specialty dice), you cast your Fire Breath attack. This burns all Barricades, revealing the delicious Villager goodness inside. It also melts the armor of 1 Knight, taking that die out of play. Then the Dragon also goes out of play. Count the Villagers and return to your lair or continue your turn, at your choice.&#10;&#10;Play continues until some dragon/player has eaten 15 or more Villagers and is satiated. Everyone left in that round of play still gets a turn to try and beat the high score.&#10;&#10;",

Well meet Wordious&hellip; The new word puzzle game with an element of surprise. Wordious is like nothing you have ever seen before, what will happen when you need to place your letters on a gameboard that is made up by tiles, tiles that you and your opponents take turns placing.&#10;Wordious is a family game with classic board game elements.&#10;&#10;&#10;    Each player draws seven letter tiles. Then the board tiles are divided among the players. &#10;    At the beginning of a player's turn, they can choose to place a board tile. Each board tile is printed double-sided. If a player decided to place a board tile, they have to play a word on that tile and link it to a word on.&#10;    After the player has placed a word, they draw as many letters as played.&#10;    The game ends when a player has no letters left or everyone passes. &#10;    Every unplayed board tile is worth 15 points at the end of the game. Unplayed letters are penalized.&#10;&#10;&#10;This game is like a modular Scrabble game.&#10;&#10;",

Generals imagined it would be a quick Napoleonic-style war to settle nationalist and imperialist conflicts... but soon enough it became a nightmare. Hundreds of thousands suffered and died, as war raged for four years - from the trenches of Flanders to the steppes of Ukraine, from the mountains of the Alps to the deserts of Syria, from the depths of the ocean to the heights of the sky. No one had a clear understanding of how the war could be won. And in the end, it wasn't. It was only stopped for twenty years.&#10;&#10;The Unwinnable War is a block wargame for 2 to 4 players. One or two players may play either side, the Central Powers and the Entente.&#10;&#10;The game is PnP, i.e. all materials are freely downloadable. However, players need to provide their own components, including the 70 wooden blocks in order to play the game.&#10;&#10;",

No longer willing to stand up to NATO in set-piece battles which they know they will lose, the Taliban insurgents disguise themselves among the population, use Improvised Explosive Devices, and draw upon large numbers of expendable recruits arriving from Pakistan and elsewhere. Can the Taliban defeat the enormous technological edge held by the Government of Afghanistan (GoA) and their NATO Allies? Or can the GoA convince the wavering population to have faith in the new government, and set the conditions in Panjwayi for stability to take hold for the first time in a generation?&#10;&#10;Choose either side, and use your unique strengths against your opponent's weaknesses to determine who will win control of the symbolic home of the Taliban.&#10;&#10;Designed by a soldier who fought there, Panjwayi is easy to learn, quick to play, and hard to master. Using elegant abstraction to simplify complex military operations, Panjwayi captures the frustration and feel of the deadly summer of 2008.&#10;As the Taliban say of their enemies, &quot;You have the watches, we have the time.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

The Rumble Fighters and art style is inspired by 80s Saturday Morning Cartoons and video games that we all love.&#10;&#10;Players receives six Rumble Fighters - two powerful leaders and four warriors via draft or random draw. Each Rumble Fighter has a health value, an attack value, a defense value, special abilities, and varied Action Points that indicate which directions they can attack and defend.&#10;&#10;Each Player places six Rumble Fighters onto a four-by-four grid and then uses your turns doing movements and attacks. Each turn, you have three movements to move your Rumble Fighters into the best position to attack: Dash, Castle, and Slide. When you Dash, you move a single character to an adjacent space. When you Castle, you can exchange two of your adjacent fighters. When you slide, you can move an entire row or column of fighter in either direction.&#10;&#10;Positioning is the main component of the game. How can I position my Rumble Fighters in the best possible way to eliminate all my Opponent's fighter and win the game?&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "From the Avalanche Press website:&#10;&#10;World War II began when the German battleship Schleswig-Holstein opened fire in the early morning hours of 1 September 1939. The war started on the Baltic Sea, and some of its very last actions took place there as well.&#10;&#10;Sea of Iron is a complete Second World War at Sea boxed game based on actions on the Baltic Sea between 1939 and 1945. Thirty-six scenarios track the operations and battles that took place or could have taken place between the fleets and air forces of Germany, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, the Soviet Union, Finland and Sweden. In addition to their complete Baltic Sea orders of battle, the Soviets, Swedes and Finns all have additional ships they planned or began to construct but did not complete. And of course the game includes scenarios for their use.&#10;&#10;There are 140 &ldquo;long&rdquo; ship pieces and 420 standard-sized square ones representing smaller warships, transports, aircraft (many, many aircraft) and a handful of markers. This is a big game, at least in terms of pieces. The map is not so big: the Baltic Sea is pretty small and almost completely land-locked, with ports and airfields in abundance. Aircraft are very potent in this theater, and ships have very little room to hide. The map by Guy Riessen shows the full Baltic on a single 11x17-inch panel.&#10;&#10;The scenarios cover all of the action from the Polish &ldquo;Operation Peking&rdquo; in which three destroyers escaped to England just before the war began, to the planned Swedish invasion of German-held Denmark in May 1945.&#10;&#10;",

Both of them will try to reduce their opponent's life points to zero (0) to defeat them and win the game!&#10;&#10;Both players will firstly choose a Weapon to be their Starting Weapon. There are 3 Weapons available: Wakizashi, a light knife; Katana, a dangerous sword; and Naginata, a heavy halberd. Their choice is crucial to their strategy!&#10;&#10;Then, in each turn, both players will receive 3 Action cards. Action cards show 2 different actions in their opposite sides, so players will have to choose the action they want to use while losing the other one during that turn.&#10;Actions include Attack, Parry, Move and Unsheath. Attack allows players to damage their opponent. Parry cancels an opponent's Attack if played in front of it, and also applies a penalty to the opponent in that case. Move allows players to move their Samurai token on the Dojo (board). Unsheath allows players to change their active Weapon.&#10;&#10;Both players will prepare their turn strategy simultaneously setting their 3 Action cards in the selected way, and then they will reveal their chosen actions one by one. When all 3 actions have been solved, if no player has their life track on zero (0) or below, the game continues. Players add the numbers in their actions to place the Reiki and Hearth tokens, which have special effects on the Dojo, and just start a brand new turn!&#10;&#10;When a Samurai is defeated, having their life on zero (0) or below, the game ends! The Samurai who is still alive is the winner. Several games can be played in a row adding punctuations to enjoy a more complete experience.&#10;&#10;",

Each player also has a unique Character card and starts with two Item cards, both of which can be used to change the flow of the gamw.&#10;&#10;There is a total of 126 cards in the game.&#10;&#10;35 of them are Character Cards featuring characters from both Dangan Ronpa and Dangan Ronpa 2, there are also 7 types of Role Cards (19 cards total), &#10;1. Alter Ego (Hope): Select 1 person each night, and you will be told if the person is Hope Side or Despair Side. Reveal your Role Card when you are killed. You win if the Blackened dies. (1 card)&#10;2. White (Hope): Similar to villager, no special characteristics. You win if the Blackened dies. (10 cards)&#10;3. Despair Disease Patient (Hope): Appears to others as being on Despair Side despite being on Hope Side. (1 card)&#10;4. Monomi (Hope): Select 1 player to guard each night. If the Blackened targets the same player, you die in an explosion and they live on (effect similar to &quot;Knight&quot; role). You appear to be on Despair Side despite being on Hope Side. You win if the Blackened dies. (1 card)&#10;5. Traitor (Despair): Can see who the Blackened (and other Traitors) are on the first night but the Blackened doesn't know who they are. They win if the Blackened wins. (1 card)&#10;6. Blackened (Despair): Select 1 player each night to attack (like a Werewolf). Reveal your role card when you are killed. You win if you commit a set number of murders and then survive until the next night. (1 card)&#10;7. Ultimate Despair (Despair?): Appears to be on Hope Side until somebody dies and appears to be on Despair Side thereafter. This role has a solo victory objective to be punished during the Class Trial. (1 card)&#10;19 types of item cards (49 total), 2 target cards (for use by black to indicate who to kill off) 16 Summary cards (explaining the game)&#10;3 blank character cards, 1 blank role card and 1 blank item card for your own creations.&#10;Inside would also contain a rule book explaining all the different modes and explanation of all the characters.&#10;There is also a template for you to record down your plays for the gamemasters usage.&#10;&#10;",

It remains the ultimate lesson to master: the invocation of Gigamons. After this test, one that will catch more Gigamons be promoted to Elemage. Good luck and good luck to all!&#10;&#10;Aim of the game&#10;Find the pairs Elemons to the exchange against Gigamons.&#10;&#10;Setting up of the game:&#10;&#10;1-Mix all the Elemons tiles face down and create a 3 by 3 square!&#10;2-Place the 7 Gigamons and the Rocks tiles on the side of the play area.&#10;3-The remaining Tiles of Elemons form the deck.&#10;&#10;How to play?&#10;&#10;    The youngest begins.&#10;    In turn, each player returns 2 face tiles.&#10;        If the tiles are different, the player puts the face down (Polymon always forms a pair with any elemon)&#10;        If the tiles are identical, the player wins and triggers the power the Elemon that is drawn (see specials ability of each Elemons. Then he replaces them 2 tiles from the deck without looking at them.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;If a player has 3 identical Elemons, it can put them back in the box to catch the Gigamon associate. If an opponent already has this Gigamon, he can steal it.&#10;Then it was the turn of the next player.&#10;&#10;Elemon powers:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Polymon: Functions as a wild, always forming a pair with any elemon.&#10;     Floramon: The player takes a tile from the top of the draw pile and adds it to their group of tiles.&#10;     Aeromon: Swap one of the tiles in front of you with a tile in front of another player. The player who gets the ability gets to choose which tiles are swapped.&#10;     Pyromon: Choose a tile in front of another player and remove it from the game.&#10;     Hydromon: While everyone else closes their eyes, look at four of the tiles in the 3X3 grid and then turn them back over.&#10;     Geomon: Place a rock tile on one of the tiles in the 3X3 grid. No player may pick up the tile underneath the rock until the player who played it takes their next turn.&#10;     Electromon: The player gets an extra turn.&#10;&#10;&#10;End of the game&#10;The game ends in 2 ways:&#10;&#10;    When a player has caught 3 Gigamons;&#10;    When the Elemons tiles deck is empty.&#10;&#10;&#10;Who win the game?&#10;&#10;Who ever has the most Gigamons is  promoted to Elemage!&#10;In case of tie, who ever has the most Elemons wins.&#10;In case of a tie, all tied players are  promoted to Elemages.&#10;&#10;",

Like the classic Asshole or President game, Supply and Command lets you take charge as the new park Supervisor. But watch out, it's Survival of the Fitness, where new rules and new dicks can lead to some awkwardly situations. With original pics of the TPB characters, its the perfect game for those smokey cheeseburger liquor parties. Guaranteed to make your night extra greasy! *This game is supported by the People&rsquo;s Freedom of Choices and Voices Act.&#10;&#10;The deck contains cards ranked from 12 to 1, along with two Jokers, Cory and Trevor. Each card bears a number, which is not only its rank, but also tells you how many of that card exist in the deck. The lower the number, the better the rank.&#10;&#10;The deck is dealt out to all players and the object is to get rid of your cards as fast as possible. The hand begins with one person playing one or more card to the center of the table. The cards played must all be of the same rank (although Jokers are wild, and may be played with any other cards). Each player in turn must now either play the same number of cards of a better rank, or pass. Play continues around the table until everyone has passed; at that point, the cards are cleared and whoever played the last set of cards leads the next round. After everyone has gone out, the players are ranked. The person who first got rid of all his cards becomes the Trailer Park Supervisor. The last becomes the Shit Puppet. Players change seat position to represent the new hierarchy and begin another round.&#10;&#10;TPB: Supply and Command also includes two optional decks, Supervisor and Trailer Park. These cards are used to provide additional advantages to the Supervisor or to make the Shit Puppets' life more miserable.&#10;&#10;",

GEAR, CHANCE, and CHALLENGE Cards define your journey along this Trail's map.&#10;&#10;1 TRAIL MAP - On your turn, move your DIY game piece 1 space (unless the Chance card instructs otherwise) along this waterproof, fold out game board map of the Appalachian Trail. Each space has a color indicating which type of card play occurs: brown, blue, or green.&#10;&#10;20 GEAR Cards - These cards are distributed evenly at the beginning of the game and are visible in front of each player throughout. If you land on a Brown space, you have the option to swap 1 Gear card with the player of your choice.&#10;&#10;50 CHANCE Cards - If you land on a Blue space, draw a Chance card and follow its instructions. Encounter opportunities to race ahead, hazards that slow your pace, or choose to stop and enjoy the trail. If you have a Gear card that helps you overcome a Chance card's emergency scenario and the Chance card has a point value, add it to your Trail Journal stack; otherwise, return it to the bottom of the main stack.&#10;&#10;75 CHALLENGE Cards - Always keep 5 of these cards hidden in your hand, drawing another after one is played. If you land on a Green space, receive a Challenge question from the hand of a player of your choice. Answer Trivia (39 cards) about hiking first aid, Trail history, LEAVE NO TRACE camping and backpacking skills, or identify Animals (27 cards) and Plants (9 cards). If you answer correctly, add this point-having Challenge card to your Trail Journal stack; otherwise, add it to the other player's stack.&#10;&#10;1 Thru Hike Card - The game ends when the first player takes the 5-point Thru Hike card -- arriving at one of the ends of the Trail. All players then tally the points from their Trail Journal card stacks and the player with the most points is the Winner!&#10;&#10;",

The side with a full army wins by capturing all opposing pawns. The side with the pawns wins by checkmating the King. Another variant known as Horde Chess adds four extra pawns to the side with only pawns.&#10;&#10;In addition to offering a unique puzzle, Dunsany's Chess is good for teaching chess, since one player can observe the moves of the pieces while needing only to remember how to make pawn moves.&#10;&#10;",

Players work on multiple cakes at a time &ndash; spinning the wheel to determine their pieces, stacking luscious layers and toppers to complete their cakes, and judging finished creations for points. With thousands of possible designs, the game is deliciously different every time you play!&#10;&#10;How to Play:&#10;1. Players take turns spinning the wheel to determine the number and type of pieces they may pick from the pile.&#10;2. After each turn, players place the pieces they can on one of many cakes they are creating, following the specific order outlined on the package.&#10;3. Upon completion of a cake, players use the measuring stick to determine how many ribbon cards their cakes have earned.&#10;4. Play continues until all ribbon cards have been distributed. The player with the most cards wins!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The Suez Canal was essential to British strategic communications and trade in the Great War, as well as being an important political symbol. In August of 1916, the Ottoman Empire sent an expeditionary force, which included contingents of Germans and Austro-Hungarians, against the canal. While the British were expecting an attack, the Ottomans gained tactical surprise by attacking at night. If the Ottoman attack had succeeded, Britain&rsquo;s prestige and warmaking capacity would be severely damaged.&#10;&#10;Suez 1916 uses the Fire &amp; Movement system. The movement and combat systems are designed around the realities of mechanized warfare, giving motorized and/or specially-trained units clear advantages. Players can augment units at the instant of combat with support fire, provided by weapons ranging from mortars through cannon and light ground attack aircraft to heavy bombers. A seemingly predictable assault can be overturned at the last minute by heavy defending fires, while even small units may develop tremendous offensive punch with the assistance of a heavy bombardment. Winning the battle is a matter of maneuver, firepower and asset management.&#10;&#10;The historical battle was a touch-and-go affair, ending with the British pushing the Turks just far enough to keep the canal safe. The British have the stronger force, but the Central Powers has the advantages of surprise, initiative, and strong artillery support. The player who best utilizes his strengths and is prepared to capitalize on opportunities will prevail.&#10;&#10;Details:&#10;&#10;    Level: Regiment/Brigade&#10;    Hex: .6 miles (1 km) &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The lone German army there, Hindenburg&rsquo;s Eighth, had to rely on interior lines and railroads to concentrate against each Russian army in turn. This game focuses on the southern half of the campaign, with the northern half factored into the victory conditions. Those victory conditions vary with the strategic options chosen by each player so neither knows the other&rsquo;s intent.&#10;&#10;Tannenberg uses a modification of the Fire &amp; Movement game system. Developed to portray the mechanized battlefields of a later generation, F&amp;M stresses the use of rapidly-concentrated fire support to generate breakthroughs, followed by a rapid penetration by mobile reserves. In 1914, although railroads allowed the rapid shifting of forces on a large scale, no one moved faster than a man on foot on the battlefield, making exploitation ineffective. However, here both players have hidden movement, allowing them to concentrate in unexpected locations to surround and destroy isolated enemy units. The clumsy and inflexible fire support is represented by the artillery brigades available to division and corps commanders. It must be brought to the point of decision, then supplied to give it the firepower to affect the fighting.&#10;&#10;The historical outcome at Tannenberg was the destruction of Samsonov&rsquo;s army, but it need not have been so. Both players have options and can achieve decisive success. The player who makes the better choices, and backs his strategy to the hilt, will emerge the victor.&#10;&#10;Details:&#10;&#10;    Level: Brigade&#10;    Hex: 3 miles (5 km)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

As time goes running... the ball must enter the roulette and must wait for the return to track. Then the goal is to reach within a few seconds and a few other obstacles. And if you get the finish in first place, you are the winner. Good luck!&#10;&#10;De la caja del juego:&#10;&#10;En el S&uacute;per Marat&oacute;n Feber hay dos mandos para dos jugadores. Ya preparado desde el punto de salida, debes recorrer toda la pista hasta la meta sin hacer trampas. Deber&aacute;s salvar muchos obst&aacute;culos en el recorrido...&#10;&#10;Para subir los escalones del recorrido hay que darle la fuerza justa. Mientras el tiempo va corriendo... la bola debe entrar en la ruleta y debes esperar a que la devuelva a pista. Entonces el llegar a meta es cuesti&oacute;n de pocos segundos y otros pocos obst&aacute;culos. Y si llegas el primero, eres el vencedor. &iexcl;Suerte!&#10;&#10;",

You need only a standard 54-card deck of playing cards to play.&#10;&#10;You play the role of the Usurper, a cunning and skillful silver-tongued devil attempting to wrest control from the four kings of the countryside. You do this by climbing the social ladder in each of the four kingdoms, but beware... too many missteps and your machinations will become all too evident, and then it's off with your head!&#10;&#10;Playing a game of Kinga involves taking turns purchasing cards from the center tableaux (sort of a reverse-tableau building mechanic), in order to reveal the kings at the bottom of the stacks, or exiling cards from your hand. The game is won if you reveal all four kings -- however, if you are unable to purchase or exile a card on your turn, you must turn one of the kings sideways, raising suspicion of your plan. If all four kings are turned sideways and you need to raise suspicion again, the kings have caught on to your game, and have ordered your execution!&#10;&#10;Kinga contains a novel chaining mechanic for purchasing cards -- You first play a 'base' card that determines your value, then any number of other cards from your hand that match either the value or the suit of the previously played card. Each card beyond the first adds 1 to the total value of your currency, and the suits used determine the cards you may purchase. Playing 3 of a kind in a chain lets you draw 1 additional card immediately, and playing all four suits in a chain allows you to draw 2 additional cards immediately.&#10;&#10;",

As each card contains multiple territories of different terrain types, the map varies from game to game.&#10;&#10;Players must explore the terrain on the map, expand their settlements by exploiting local resources and of course try and exterminate their opponent.&#10;&#10;To help their civilization grow they can gain knowledge which is traded in for developments that impact upon game play.  18 different developments are available to help, on just 9 cards. Each development a player chooses deprives them and their opponent of another alternative one.&#10;&#10;Player actions are selected on a roundel, with a range of actions available each turn, although repeat actions are not possible.  Each completed journey round the roundel completes a season of the year and the different seasons confer benefits and responsibilities upon players that affect the progress of the game.&#10;&#10;Players win by being the first to accrue a specified number of  victory points.  Victory points are achieved through gaining developments and building developing settlements.&#10;&#10;All components for play can fit in a 2oz tobacco tin making it highly portable, and files include labels for the lid of such a container.&#10;&#10;",

Competing teams of human explorers use space stations spread throughout the universe as bases for discovering new worlds and befriending aliens to help them in their quest. Explorer teams are not only racing each other, but meteors are striking planets and threatening these new worlds as well. Will your team be able to reach a planet in time to use its resources and protect it from future meteor strikes?&#10;&#10;Cosmic Run is a quick, push-your-luck, space race for 1-4 players. On a turn, a player rolls dice and must commit at least 1 of them to one of the various exploration tracks or to an alien card. Some of the tracks require multiple identical dice, with the most valuable tracks costing many identical dice. However, once a player commits a die, it cannot be moved. So players have to decide between a conservative approach (making sure and steady progress along less valuable tracks) or an aggressive approach (pushing one's luck to try to move up the highly valued tracks).&#10;&#10;Players may opt to use their dice to befriend aliens, rather than explore, because the aliens provide special powers that can eventually help them move along their exploration tracks even faster.&#10;&#10;The game may be played competitively or cooperatively.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Hero's Journey Home is a fantasy card and dice game that begins at the end of a great quest. Your adventurers have defeated a terrible enemy and claimed a magical prize, but now they must make the arduous journey back home. Strange and deadly monsters know the adventurers are weak and in possession of a powerful item, and they will pursue them until all have been defeated.&#10;&#10;The setup is pretty simple:&#10;&#10;1. Choose a quest to have completed; pick up the quest item.&#10;2. Choose your adventurers.&#10;3. If you have a spellcaster (and you should have at least one), choose their spells.&#10;4. Split the Journey deck in two, shuffle both halves and stick the Home card in the bottom half.&#10;&#10;Playing is even simpler:&#10;&#10;1. Flip Journey cards and resolve the actions.&#10;2. The game ends when either the Home card is drawn or all adventurers have been killed.&#10;&#10;The gameplay requires you to manage your resources (adventurers, items, spells, and money) with an eye towards a long-term goal (home) in the face of short-term obstacles (monsters and other unfriendly cards). Every choice you make at every stage of the game will help decide if you make it home.&#10;&#10;",

Some of the pieces are missing one or two of their corners. After a piece is moved it is inactivated (by turning it 45 degrees in either direction, or from square to diamond). When a piece is moved past an inactive piece it will push that piece back to its active state it if there is a corner of that piece in its path. Players capture (remove from the board) any pieces of their opponent's activated in this way. Their own pieces remain on the board, ready to be played again.&#10;&#10;If a player has no more active pieces, they lose the game.&#10;&#10;",

Players must choose their units and attack wisely to ensure victory.&#10;&#10;There are many cards in Siege Warfare, and there are no random packs.  All Siege Warfare cards are available in one of the 6 ready-to-play decks.  Players can purchase any of our 6 ready-to-play decks, or customize their own deck from the cards they own.  All decks have 50 cards, and this represents your life total as well as the cards you have at your disposal.&#10;&#10;Damage inflicted to an opposing player forces that player to discard that many cards from the top of their deck.  The goal of Siege Warfare is to eliminate all of your opponents.  A player is eliminated when they have no cards left in their deck.&#10;&#10;",

Every role is important, and the confrontation is merciless. Be organized and communicate because a captain is nothing without his crew: the Chief Mate, the Radio Operator, and the Engineer.&#10;&#10;All the members of a team sit on one side of the table, and they each take a particular role on the submarine, with the division of labor for these roles being dependent on the number of players in the game: One player might be the captain, who is responsible for moving the submarine and announcing some details of this movement; another player is manning the sonar in order to listen to the opposing captain's orders and try to decipher where that sub might be in the water; a third player might be working in the munitions room to prepare torpedoes, mines and other devices that will allow for combat.&#10;&#10;Captain Sonar can be played in two modes: turn-by-turn or simultaneous. In the latter set-up, all the members of a team take their actions simultaneously while trying to track what the opponents are doing, too. When a captain is ready to launch an attack, the action pauses for a moment to see whether a hit has been recorded &mdash; then play resumes with the target having snuck away while the attacker paused or with bits of metal now scattered across the ocean floor.&#10;&#10;Multiple maps are included with varying levels of difficulty.&#10;&#10;",

Legend says that the island is full of treasure, including the famous Golden Pineapple, but it also says that treasure is fiercely guarded by hordes of fearsome penguin warriors, some of which ride giant polar bears. That potential danger is why you're alone in your boat, on your own but eager to take a run on the island and try your luck.&#10;&#10;For now, only the sound of the waves and the cries of the gulls disturb the peace of this seemingly idyllic island...but as soon as you set foot in the jungle bordering the beach, the drums of war start sounding and you realize that you've suddenly gained the status of prey!&#10;&#10;Pingo Pingo is a hyper-frenetic action game punctuated by a soundtrack in which you have to react quickly, run, shoot a gun, in which you must be precise, brave, fast, and focused because if not, well, you might not leave the island in one piece. As soon as the soundtrack begins, the game is on!&#10;&#10;On your turn, reveal the top card from your deck and place it face-up in the middle of the table. Each card requires a specific action when it is revealed. Be the first to tap on a treasure to grab it, but watch out for traps and critters, and make sure the music allows you to take this treasure. Tap on camp cards to steal cards from the other players' stashes. Adventure cards trigger actions to be completed before the &quot;Pingo Pingo&quot; cry in the soundtrack. Get up and run from one base to another to cross a suspension bridge. Grab the gun and aim well to defeat fearsome bear riders. Tap the friendly monkey sorcerer to regain life. Run to the shipwreck and back to shoot the gigantic space penguin. Grab all the previously played cards and deal them as fast as you can to escape the penguin rampage!&#10;&#10;Any mistake will cost you one of your seven life points. After 15 minutes, the player with the most treasures wins the game &mdash; but don't be reckless because you can't carry more than three treasures per life point...&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Quantum tic-tac-toe is a &quot;quantum generalization&quot; of tic-tac-toe in which the players' moves are &quot;superpositions&quot; of plays in the classical game. The game was invented by Allan Goff of Novatia Labs.&#10;&#10;Quantum tic-tac-toe captures the three quantum phenomena discussed above by modifying one basic rule of classical tic-tac-toe: the number of marks allowed in each square. Additional rules specify when and how a set of marks &quot;collapses&quot; into classical moves.&#10;&#10;On each move, the current player marks two squares with their letter (X or O), instead of one, and each letter (X or O) is subscripted with the number of the move (beginning counting with 1). The pair of marks are called spooky marks. (Because X always moves first, the subscripts on X are always odd and the subscripts on O are always even.)&#10;&#10;For example, player 1's first move might be to place &quot;X1&quot; in both the upper left and lower right squares. The two squares thus marked are called entangled. During the game, there may be as many as eight spooky marks in a single square (if the square is entangled with all eight other squares).&#10;&#10;The phenomenon of collapse is captured by specifying that a &quot;cyclic entanglement&quot; causes a &quot;measurement&quot;. A cyclic entanglement is a cycle in the entanglement graph; for example, if&#10;&#10;square 1 is entangled via move X1 with square 4, and&#10;square 4 is entangled via move X3 with square 8, and&#10;square 8 is in turn entangled via move O4 with square 1,&#10;then these three squares form a cyclic entanglement. At the end of the turn on which the cyclic entanglement was created, the player whose turn it is not &mdash; that is, the player who did not create the cycle &mdash; chooses one of two ways to &quot;measure&quot; the cycle and thus cause all the entangled squares to &quot;collapse&quot; into classical tic-tac-toe moves. In the preceding example, since player 2 created the cycle, player 1 decides how to &quot;measure&quot; it. Player 1's two options are:&#10;&#10;X1 collapses into square 1. This forces O4 to collapse into square 8 and X3 to collapse into square 4.&#10;X1 collapses into square 4. This forces X3 to collapse into square 8 and O4 to collapse into square 1.&#10;Any other chains of entanglements hanging off the cycle would also collapse at this time; for example, if square 1 were also entangled via O2 with square 5, then either measurement above would force O2 to collapse into square 5. (Note that it is impossible for two or more cyclic entanglements to be created in a single turn.)&#10;&#10;When a move collapses into a single square, that square is permanently marked (in larger print) with the letter and subscript of the collapsed move &mdash; a classical mark. A square containing a classical mark is fixed for the rest of the game; no more spooky marks may be placed in it.&#10;&#10;The first player to achieve a tic-tac-toe (three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) consisting entirely of classical marks is declared the winner. Since it is possible for a single measurement to collapse the entire board and give classical tic-tac-toes to both players simultaneously, the rules declare that the player whose tic-tac-toe has the lower maximum subscript earns one point, and the player whose tic-tac-toe has the higher maximum subscript earns only one-half point.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Lets face it, trolls are a bit grumpy and usually don't get along well with others. Fortunately for this group of disgruntled trolls they happen to be quarreling in a field full of boulders. In Me Throw Rock players play the role of trolls who happen to be in the thick of an argument that can only be settled by throwing large rocks at each other. The player who has the best accuracy wins the game!&#10;&#10;Me Throw Rock is an eighteen card dexterity game where players throw a set of six double sided rock cards at target troll cards over a series of rounds. Every round a single target troll card is thrown onto the floor. Each player takes a turn throwing their own colored rock cards at the target card until all their cards have been thrown. The player who has the majority of three rock cards that are the closest to the target wins the round. The winner of the round collects the target card and any of the three closest cards that are showing the split side up.&#10;&#10;The games ends after all five target troll cards have been collected or if a player has one or less rock cards to throw. After the game has ended the players must tally their points by looking at the cards they have collected. Each target troll card collected scores three points and each rock card of the players color scores one point. The player with the most points wins the game. Ties go to the player who has collected the least number of rock cards of their opponents color.&#10;&#10;Me Throw Rock is designed to be played on the floor with a space of about 8 to 10 feet in length. However, Me Throw Rock is not limited to play on a floor and can be played on any surface with a suitable flat target area such as a table or bed.&#10;&#10;",

Each domino consists of two simple icons placed at each end and representing common items such as &quot;head&quot;, &quot;house&quot;, &quot;sun&quot;, &quot;knife&quot;, etc.&#10;&#10;Every person starts with two dominoes in their hand and play on a starting tableau of 4 dominoes in the center of the table.  They also have pen and paper to record their guesses.&#10;&#10;On your turn play one of your dominoes onto the tableau to form a word or phrase from the two adjacent pictures.  Any combination is allowed but you're only joining two icons.  Write your phrase secretly on your paper.  For example, &quot;bird&quot; and &quot;hand&quot; could be &quot;bird feeder&quot;, &quot;a bird in the hand&quot;, &quot;pet bird&quot;, etc.&#10;&#10;Others now write on their papers what they think your word or phrase is.  Once everyone has made their guesses score points as follows:  everyone scores one point for guessing correctly, the turn player scores one point for everyone that guessed his phrase or just one point if everyone guessed his phrase.  A 2 point bonus is awarded the player who solely guessed the phrase.&#10;&#10;First player to 11 points wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

They taught you to light a flickering flame at the tip of your finger, but other than that you've spent much more time reading books than learning powerful spells as future great wizards like you should.&#10;&#10;So when you heard about the Big Book of Madness hidden in the great school library, you couldn't help but to sneak in and peek in this intriguing tome in spite of your professors' warnings. When you slowly lift the cover of the terrible book, dozens of dreadful creatures rush out, threatening to destroy the world itself! This was your mistake, and only you can fix it now! Learn from the library to fight back against the monsters, and try not to sink into insanity...&#10;&#10;The Big Book of Madness is a challenging co-operative game in which the players are magic students who must act as a team to turn all the pages of the book, then shut it by defeating the terrible monsters they've just freed.&#10;&#10;Each player has their own element deck that they build during the game and use for several purposes, such as learning or casting a spell, adding a new element to their deck, destroy or healing a curse. Spells allow you to support your playmates, improve your deck, draw cards, etc. &mdash; but the monsters from the book fight back. Each comes with terrible curses that are triggered every turn unless you dispel them in time. They will make you discard elements, add madness cards to your deck, or lose spells...&#10;&#10;If you manage to turn six pages and defeat all of the monsters, you win the game!&#10;&#10;",

The performers come from a variety of genres: singers, dancers, comedians, jugglers, musicians, and magicians.&#10;&#10;In game terms, a hand of twelve cards is dealt to every player. The start player leads any card they like. The next player can play any card they want except that they CANNOT follow suit. Then the next player can't follow either suit, and so on until each player has played one card, with these cards comprising the &quot;trick&quot;. Whoever played the highest card wins the trick, taking all the played cards, adding them to their score pile, and starting a new trick by playing any card. A hand continues until each player has played all of their cards, then you score cards (each card has a value on it) that you've collected and the game continues for three hands. Between hands, you take all the cards, shuffle them up, and deal them out again.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "For those with the eldritch gift, temptation lurks around every corner, even in leisure. Just consider the possibilities available to the practitioner of magic. Imagine poker with spells! No person could resist such temptation, and even a casual review of history will prove that none could.&#10;&#10;&#10;    The famous last play of Ephippus of Athens? It was about Circe&rsquo;s never ending thirst for cheating at cards. &#10;    Morgan le Fay and Merlin regularly crossed wits over a deck. &#10;    Roger Bollingbroke&rsquo;s most heinous crime was the transparently bogus run of five straight flushes in a row. &#10;&#10;&#10;And so it has gone. The application of magic to card games is as natural as mixing mandrake and worm&rsquo;s husk.&#10;&#10;For the first time, however, the rules for a game specifically created for wizards have been pieced together from fragments found in tombs, dusty used bookstores, and in the classified ads of one small newspaper. Though magic has largely been forgotten in the centuries since this game was invented, modern game design has given us a way to imitate the arcana outlined in the reconstructed rules. The result is a &ldquo;no-magic-required&rdquo; whimsical romp for 2-5 players.&#10;&#10;Hocus places the players in the flamboyant boots of wizards, using their powerful advantages to create opportunities, manipulate the game, and alter the flow of cards. Wizards hate being pinned down and live by the mantra &ldquo;You shall not fold!&rdquo; Each turn, players choose one Spell to use. As you are new to Hocus, we shall first discuss the three Basic Spells.&#10;&#10;Use the first basic Spell to play cards to the Community. Play thoughtfully, as everyone shares the cards in the Community! The second Spell is for building the Pot. In addition to Suit and Strength, every card has a point value. Cards played to the Pot contribute their points to the winner of each Showdown. Play cards to build a Pocket with the third Spell. (Never ask to see a wizard&rsquo;s pocket!) Each player takes one of their Pockets and combines it with the Community to form a hand during Showdowns. The best hand claims all points in the Pot.&#10;&#10;There is, of course, a twist. Trust a wizard to provide a twist! There are multiple Communities, each with a Pot, and players can compete in multiple Showdowns if they have the Pockets. Hocus is not merely a matter of building good hands, but making a winning hand where your opponents least expect and profiting with a hefty Pot. Timing and careful, targeted play will win the day. And time is limited. You may have conjured a Straight Flush, but it&rsquo;s worthless with no points in the Pot!&#10;&#10;Now, look at the other spells in the game. There are eight different spell books, each with their own unique approaches to the game, providing every wizard who plays with their own special abilities. The spell books raise the game to another level, with even more tools for bending luck to your advantage.&#10;&#10;Travel way back to a dark, dank inn, shuffle the cards, and play the favorite game of the legendary Merlin and Morgan le Fay. Hocus is a little like poker, but a lot more magic!&#10;&#10;",

Your elite Bomb Defusal Team (BDT) has been called upon to neutralize the threat. Does your team have what it takes to work through the intricacies of the bombs and defuse them all in time?&#10;&#10;FUSE is a real-time co-operative game that employs 25 dice and 65 cards. Each game is set to a ten-minute timer, and players must work together in that ten minutes to defuse all of the bombs. Each bomb is represented by a card which needs a certain combination of dice in order to defuse it. A player will draw a number of dice equal to the number of players out of a bag and roll them. Players must then decide who will get which dice, but each player must take one and only one.&#10;&#10;It's a simple task: maximize the potential of your dice among all of the players. The problem is that you have only ten minutes, and there are more than twenty bombs on your ship. You don't have time to think through every option. You barely have time to yell at Grandma as she reaches for that red die you need. This game will self-destruct in ten minutes...&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "June 1944, the Allies have finally opened the second front demanded by Stalin. The Red Army then launches the Bagration operation. Bringing considerable resources, over 2 million men and 4,000 tanks, it aims to liberate Belorussia. Taken by surprise, the German Army Group Center collapses quickly. The Soviets then advance 600 km in a month, causing an unprecedented defeat to the Germans. They are stopped at the gates of Warsaw, where the insurgency that has just started will be ruthlessly suppressed.&#10;&#10;But the Axis forces are not yet beaten and 10 months of fierce fighting will be necessary until the final victory.&#10;&#10;Victory Roads is a historical simulation retracing the campaign on the Eastern Front, from June 22, 1944, the day of the launch of the offensive Bagration in Byelorussia, until May 1945 in Berlin.&#10;&#10;Victory Roads uses the same game system as Liberty Roads, our wargame on the Western Front, from the D-Day to April 1945, while integrating the specific characteristics of this campaign. The counters are the divisions (Axis) and corps (Soviets) of both sides involved in the campaign.&#10;&#10;The system focuses on the different structure of the two opposing armies. Supports represent the effects of various materiel, equipment, as well as specific battle events.&#10;&#10;Players who are used to play with Liberty Roads should find Victory Roads very familiar.&#10;&#10;The main difference the game offers relies in the way to handle the Soviet player&rsquo;s offensive. A TO marker represents an area of logistic and administrative support from the Chief Commander of Stavka. Theaters of Operation markers are somewhat similar to PLUTO markers although slightly more tricky to handle.

        "description": "From Wikipedia:&#10;&#10;Also known as Super-spit in Wisconsin, Spit 2 in Texas, Rush in Missouri, and Spit 3 in Kentucky,[citation needed] California Spit is a fast paced shedding card game that has the added bonus of shuffling the deck.&#10;&#10;The two players sit at opposite sides of a vertical playing surface. The dealer deals half of the cards to each player. The cards are held face down. Every round, each player plays four cards face up vertically in between both players and slightly closer to themselves. Once both players have done this, they look for two or more cards having the same number. When a player finds one, he places another card on top of the cards with that number until all of the cards with the common number are covered. In other words if there are three fours out then all three cards can get a new card on top of it. If a four is played on top of a four it is called a double, and the player may place a third card on top of it. This requires that players pay attention to the cards they are laying down on the pile. If a player runs out of cards then that player wins. When there are no more groups of cards remaining, each player scoops up the four piles directly in front of him or her and places them face down on the bottom of his or her deck. That round ends and the next begins.&#10;&#10;In some versions of the game, there is a move called &quot;spitting&quot; in which the player is allowed to spit on the other player to distract him/her. It is common that they call &quot;doubles&quot; to inform the other player what they did. ment for {21+ age} a longer period of time usually 3 hours is the min, and 4 is the max.&#10;&#10;",

He gets a dance board which he has to fill with tiles of five different colors. The tiles have different length and shape so each player has to think fast and grab the tiles that he needs before his opponents take them. The first player to fill his board gets 5 points but beware of mistakes! If you used a tile that you were not allowed to or a tile was wrongly placed the player receives penalty points. Additional points are scored for unfilled hexes on opponents boards.&#10;&#10;The first player to score 25 points is declared the best choreographer and wins!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The usual Uno rules - Players race to empty their hands and catch opposing players with cards left in theirs, which score points. In turns, players attempt to play a card by matching its color or number to the topmost card on the discard pile. If unable to play, players draw cards from the draw pile until they are able to place a card. Wild and special cards spice things up a bit. Additionally, when playing their penultimate card from their hand, players must shout 'UNO' or face a forfeit of drawing two further cards.&#10;&#10;WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT FROM TRADITIONAL UNO: Altimeter Alert Card. When played, the player of the altimeter alert card chooses one color and each player puts 1 card of that color, face down, in front of them. Then each player reveals their card and whoever has the highest number wins. If 2 players have the same card, the number is invalid and the next one who has the highest number wins.&#10;Whoever wins then plays his card and the game continues.&#10;&#10;",
