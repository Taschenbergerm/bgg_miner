Players must solve a case in the town of Arkham, and prevent at all costs the plans of the evil cultists.&#10;&#10;To play you only need one board -from size of a coasters-, and a handful of coins.&#10;&#10;In turn, players place coins on the board to score better than your opponent, while trying not to lose all the Stamina and Sanity. The game ends if any of these cases occurs:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The fourth coin of Doom is placed.&#10;    The two players can not put more coins or decide not to.&#10;    Both players are eliminated.&#10;&#10;&#10;The player with more Clue (Victory Points) wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

The world is on the brink of an apocalypse, set in motion by monsters only your characters can see. Gameplay is story-based, and features deck construction and character growth. Over time, characters will unlock repressed memory fragments that will add new powers. Each mission has a unique setup and goal, which often involves hunting down a true threat hiding among the cards at the nexuses that characters investigate.&#10;&#10;The base game, called The World, comes with 584 cards, 20 six-sided dice, 1 rulebook, 1 storybook, 30 dividers, and 10 character stand-up tokens; The World contains the starting chapter of Candlepoint, Wisconsin, and also the Skinwalkers chapter. Eight more chapters appear in two expansions, The Flesh and The Devil, as well as the bonus chapter The Book of the Hybrids.&#10;&#10;",

Crossing the bay is certainly no picnic!&#10;You'll need to keep clear of the quicksands, take a biscuit break at the right moment and, above all, keep a careful watch&#10;on the rising tide in order to reach your goal. Luckily for you, archangel Saint-Michel is there to help...&#10;&#10;Capitalise on the best combinations of the dice, making good use of the biscuit pieces and archangel cubes to move forward as quickly as&#10;possible. The winner is the first player to reach the Mont Saint-Michel with their two pilgrims.&#10;If everyone is washed away by the tide, then no one wins, unless someone has taken refuge at Tombelaine.&#10;&#10;",

By constantly balancing the goal of flocking your own birds and &quot;Flock-Blocking&quot; opponents' birds, a see-saw battle for avian supremacy ensues &mdash; and beware the non-player bird-baddies (crows and hawks) that can swoop in to un-nest a would-be winner.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is simple. Each player rolls two dice on their turn to indicating coordinates on the game board grid (the tree) to place and move your six birds on the board. Each turn a player has the choice to place a bird at the rolled coordinate or play one of seven Action Cards as they work to achieve the winning formation of a four bird flock (either a square or straight line on the grid).&#10;&#10;&#10;    Fast and easy to learn and play &#10;    Finely balanced mix of luck and strategy &#10;    Territorial disputes between birds is resolved via novel &quot;Pecking Order&quot; &#10;    Introduces a unique slide mechanic when birds vie for the same spot on the boards &#10;    Non-player spoiler-birds (crows and hawks) add unique obstacles as well as chain-reaction board-reorganizing sliding and scattering &#10;    Truly an abstract &quot;gateway&quot; game that's great for kids' spatial and numerical skills (and even better for adults who are out of practice)&#10;&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Centuries ago a desert land existed in the world of the Eternal Kingdom. The land was rich from its many trade routes and populated by a nation called the People of the Book. Wise rulers had always reigned over them, and thanks to this everyone lived in prosperity. Even so, some had rebelled against the binding order, ignoring the venerable customs and breaking the law...&#10;&#10;You are one of those renegades and &quot;enemies of the kingdom&quot;, but you now have a second chance for freedom as this land's ruler prophesized that among you there is a chosen one who in the future will affect the fate of the desert lands. He decided that a trial in an ancient labyrinth would resolve who would be released and who would see daylight no more. The corridors of the labyrinth are winding and bristle with cleverly planned and dangerous pitfalls. Tales and legends also mention a guard, an immortal Golem that tramps the stone corridors.&#10;&#10;Labyrinth: The Paths of Destiny 2 ed. is an adventure board game for 2-6 players who impersonate both the great constructors of the ancient labyrinth and the daredevils who try to escape.&#10;&#10;To find a way out of the labyrinth, each player must find a special key while avoiding traps from other players, not to mention the Golem. With their two actions each turn, players can construct the multi-level labyrinth, set traps, move, rest, attack other players and much more.&#10;&#10;",

The board game is designed to be easily printed on 8.5&rdquo;x11&rdquo; paper or cardstock (or A4, for those not in the USA). You will need two regular decks of cards and dice (which you can find at almost any dollar store) for a night of sexy vampire fun with your partner. Fangs optional.&#10;&#10;There are two major aspects to gameplay. The first aspect to the gameplay are the individual rooms (setup something like Clue). There are six rooms, each with a different theme. Within the rooms, players perform sexual or erotic tasks in order to earn poker cards. At the end of the game, the player with the best poker hand wins (although, if played correctly, both players really win ;) )&#10;&#10;The second aspect of gameplay is the movement from one room to another. Players don't just move, they must perform various foreplay acts in order to successfully move their game piece.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Adventure Time Love Letter is a game of risk, deduction, and luck for 2&ndash;4 players based on the original Love Letter game by Seiji Kanai, except re-themed with characters of the hit cartoon Adventure Time. Players are suitors trying to gain the affections of Princess Bubblegum (#8).&#10;&#10;In a round, each player starts with only one card in hand; one card is removed from play. On a turn, you draw one card, and discard one of the two, using the power of the discarded card to try to eliminate other players from the round. If you're the last player in the round, or the player with the highest card when the deck runs out, then you score a point. The game is played until a player reaches a certain amount of points determined by the numbers of players.&#10;&#10;The card art is styled to be Adventure Time characters &quot;cosplaying&quot; the characters from the Tempest version of Love Letter by AEG.&#10;&#10;There are two differences in this version. Number 1 is a new win condition. If a player plays a &quot;Hero&quot; (#5), either Finn or Jake, and makes another player (including themselves) discard the other &quot;Hero&quot; card, they win the round. The idea is that you are reuniting the iconic best buds. Number 2 is, if you manage to win the round with a &quot;companion&quot; in your hand, you win 2 tokens instead of only one.&#10;&#10;",

Each player gets 5 cards and the top card on the draw pile is revealed. This is the start card.&#10;&#10;In her turn, a player must play a card (if she has one that fits) one before or one after the card on the table. Thus the panorama is created. At the end of her turn, whether she played a valid card or not, she draws a new card from the draw-pile.If there are no cards in the draw-pile, she ends her turn by drawing a card from the hand of the player on her right.&#10;&#10;The Zookeeper is a Joker. Once played, if a player has the correct card which the Keeper has replaced, that player may play that card and take the Joker for herself. The Snake card acts like an Old Maid card in that whoever has it when the panorama is complete, loses.&#10;&#10;",

Place the remaining cards and the hole markers between you; leave some space for the discard pile (e.g. used cannonballs, parrot, spyglass). Player take turns. You can play two cards for turn (e.g. you can load your cannon using 'the cannonball' card and then fire it by using 'the boom' card). At the end of your turn draw cards from the draw pile, so that you have five cards in your hand.

Using special class skills, unique weapons, and a few items, you must work together to defeat monsters intent on destroying the civilized world. This fully cooperative game will require your party to tactically dismantle each enemy in a different way before all of you are out of options. Whether casual or hardcore, Wrathborne Champions is the perfect game for all those brave enough to face the monsters' wrath.&#10;&#10;Each player is assigned a deck of cards comprised of their specific class abilities, a series of attacks specific to the weapon they are using this game, and a few personally selected items. These decks control not only the moves available to players, but also their life total, with damage being applied directly to the deck itself.&#10;&#10;Player fight against one or more giant monsters printed on 10x10 miniboards placed in the center of the play area. Unlike most &quot;big bad&quot; games, the Monster Cards in Wrathborne Champions have set attacks and actions performed each round. This &quot;AI code&quot; lets players predict a great deal of how the monsters will act, allowing them to make tactical choices during their turns to increase the likelihood of success.&#10;&#10;Monster Card life is tracked via Life Cards in a similar fashion to player decks. Most of these life cards are benign, but some alter the state of play dynamically, sometimes twisting the control out of the player's hands. Players defeat a Monster Card when all Life Cards are removed from the sectors of the Monster Card that can attack. The game ends when the last Monster Card is defeated, or the final player is killed.&#10;&#10;",

Each turn a new creature will come onto the field and the mage whose turn it is will use their Spells to attempt to capture any number of creatures on the field that match the Power and Element of the Spell they cast.  If they cannot capture a creature, then their spell is added to the Spell Pool to be used by any mage. Mages refresh their hand of Spells when they run out.&#10;&#10;Using the Spell Blending and Creature Grouping mechanics, mages will use light strategy and symbol recognition to blend spells to create new ones and even group creatures together to make bizarre and whimsical combinations.  By mastering Blending/Grouping, it helps the mage to ensure that the right spell is always at hand and maximum number of creatures are captured per spell.&#10;&#10;With beautiful, hand-drawn illustrations and a unique split-card, dual-deck design; Cast and Capture updates an old gaming favorite for a new generation of players both young and old.&#10;&#10;",

The French side can try a number of different strategies in an attempt to crush the Anglo-Allied army before the Prussians arrive. Meanwhile, the Anglo-Allied player must focus on keeping his army in the battle by using reserves in right situations until the Prussians get into the action.&#10;&#10;The game contains a battlefield map which is used to record casualties and the current strength of the participating armies. The cards are setup around the battlefield map with each card representing a corps. Players take it in turns to activate one corps and carry out an action. The rules for each individual corps action are described on the cards. The results of these actions are then recorded on the battlefield map. The game ends when either army fails a rout test or the time marker is moved to the night square.&#10;&#10;",

But the way home is hard to find: you turn right, then left and sometimes there is no way! You have to look closely and build the way anew, relocating the game boards if nescessary.&#10;&#10;To play, the 16 large game boards are laid out in a 4x4 grid on the floor.&#10;&#10;Each cattle is assembled by putting the die-cut cattle in a colored standee. Then, the cattle are randomly distributed between the players. All players start at the same spot on the grid, Mike Donalds Ranch.&#10;&#10;On your turn, a player throws the die and moves his pawn along the way, one field for each pip. The goal is to reach the color-coded pasture, matching the color of one of his cattle. To do this, it is allowed to change the grid of game boards to open up new paths and maybe hinder the other players on their plans. The first player to place all his cattle in the right pastures wins the game!&#10;&#10;",

Shuffle the cardboard counters face down. Give each player a card with a short phrase in french on it, the lowest number starts then. Pick up a cardboard counter and read the word aloud (it is written both in latin letters and in phonetics). Each player listens carefully, and says &quot;yes&quot; if he thinks this word belongs to his card. He then put the counter on his tray. If the sentence from his card is now complete, he reads it to the other players and gives a translation. The translation can be checked with the translation wheel. If it is correct, he keeps the card, otherwise the first player giving a correct translation gets the card. A round is played until all cardboard counters are gone. Then you start another round with new cards and new counters. Afer four rounds, the player with the most cards is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

On his turn, a player turns pizza pieces face up as long as they all are matching. He stops after the first different piece and turns all pieces facedown. Then it's the next players turn. If a player happens to find all four pieces, he fills his Turtle board with four of his nine counters. The second completed pizza only nets three counters, the third two counters and the fourth and last pizza only one counter. When all four pizzas are found, the pieces are shuffled and placed anew. The first player to place all his nine counters on his turtle board wins!&#10;&#10;",

If done right, the ape is in the first, the bear in the second, the chameleon in the third waggon and so on until the zebra in the last waggon. The player to match all of his waggon tiles first, wins.&#10;&#10;Color-Memo, where the train build in the first game is used again. Here, the waggons are turned on the other sid, where only a color and a uppercase letter is visible. All players use now the pawn showing Benjamin Bl&uuml;mchen and a six-sided die to walk along the train. Where Benjamin stopps, the player must name the animal in the waggon. If correct, the player gets the matching card. When all cards are found, the player with the most cards wins.&#10;&#10;A B C game. The waggons must be added in the correct sequence, the color-coded buffers are used for self-control. Can be played by one player or cooperatively.&#10;&#10;Where is my waggon? Each animal wants to find his own waggon. All the waggons are shuffled and laid out in the middle of the table, showing only the backside. The cards are also used again here. A card is drawn and the animal on it announced. The player to the right of the card drawer is the first to try to find the matching waggon. If he is correct, he gets the card, otherwise the next player tries it. When all cards are found, the player with the most cards wins.&#10;&#10;",

These sets are marked with a little animal (a bug). If you place cards of one set side by side, the bugs match each other, when placed correct. &#10;Shuffle all 36 cards and place them faceup on the table. On your turn, throw the die. On 2, 4 or 6 take any one card from the table and place it front of yourself. On 1, 3 or 5 pass the turn to the next player. Try to collect all three cards of a set. No one may take a card belonging to a set started by another player. You may start a new set only after you finished a set. The game ends when all cards are collected. The player with the most cards in front of him wins.&#10;&#10;Variant 2:&#10;Memory - play with the 24 picture cards or with all 36 cards. If played with 36 cards, always turn up three cards and try to find the matching triplets.&#10;&#10;Variant 3:&#10;I spy with my litte eye something ... Use the color cards to determine the color to spy and use the chips as victory points.&#10;&#10;",

Players start at the beginning of a track printed around the outer edge of the board.  On each turn, they roll the die and move along the track, landing on one of many types of spaces.  On a monument space, the player gains the trophy card for that monument.  A Metro space allows a player to move to any other Metro space.  A Tourmobile space allows movement to any monument, but the player must answer a question from a Challenge card to win a trophy card.  On a challenge space, the player draws a challenge card and asks another player the question.  On an incorrect answer, that player must return a trophy card to the board.  On a take a card space, the player must choose a card and answer the question to continue.  There are also roll again and lose a turn spaces.&#10;&#10;Players' turns end in one of four ways--answering a question incorrectly, answering three consecutive questions correctly, winning a trophy card or landing on a &quot;lose a turn&quot; square.&#10;&#10;Players continue to circle the board until one player collects trophy cards for all four monuments, winning the game.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Developed by University of Southern California Alumni, Trojan Challenge is a Monopoly-type game where players move around a track, landing on activity spaces which represents conferences, exhibits, performances, athletic contests and other events at the university.  When a player lands on an activity space, he may purchase that activity for the designated cost.  He may then purchase up to two upgrades (which are called &quot;reserved tables,&quot; &quot;group reservations,&quot; etc.) either immediately or on a later turn.  When other players land on these spaces, they must pay the owner the amount designated on the card.&#10;&#10;A few extra wrinkles are added.  Detour spaces place a player onto an alternate track when they are landed on.  &quot;Go Trojans Go!&quot; and &quot;We Are SC&quot; cards can give players extra money, take away money or offer other benefits or detriments.  Parking Lot spaces cause loss of a turn, and various other spaces may increase or decrease the player's money total.  Passing the start space, unlike in Monopoly, costs the player $600.&#10;&#10;Players start with $6000 each (tracked on paper--no paper money is included) and try to gain funds as they play.  Landing on other players' spaces forces a player to pay them a designated amount.  If a player cannot pay, he or she may sell any assets owned to other players or give them back to the bank for half value.  If still unable to pay in full, the player is out of the game.  The game can be played to one of three pre-agreed ending conditions--a time limit, until one or more player are eliminated or until only player is left.  The player with the most money wins.&#10;&#10;Optional rules allow a player to move another player back to the starting space by landing on their pawn and allow for discounted purchase of upgrades on spaces if matching sets are collected.&#10;&#10;A metagame rule governs the use of a &quot;Trojan Gold&quot; space.  If a player lands on this space and agrees to donate a pre-determined amount of real (not in-game) money to the real University of Southern California, he or she gains an upgrade to place on any owned property.&#10;&#10;",

Alex the cat is working hard today as a waiter at the restaurant Uoza-tei. Suddenly, the waiters collide, and all the dishes go flying up in the air! Alex races to catch them on his tray before they hit the floor. Can he save the best dishes?&#10;&#10;This is a postcard game, and can be played by one person or others working together (typically it's for two players). You hold the postcard like a tray with one hand, and flip chips in the air to try and catch them on the tray. The tray has scoring positions for 5, 3 and 1 points. Can you get the perfect score of 18 points? The game is printed as a Japanese postcard, a new style of game introduced at the Tokyo Game Market in Autumn 2014.&#10;&#10;Publisher summary:&#10;&#227;&#131;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#174;&rdquo;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#185;&rdquo;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#131;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#229;&#186;&#167;&#228;&#186;&#173;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#187;&#138;&#230;&#151;&#165;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#229;&#191;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#167;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#229;&#144;&#140;&#229;&#163;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#231;&#154;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#174;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#136;&#158;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#230;&#158;&#156;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#231;&#154;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#143;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#230;&#173;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#230;&#157;&#165;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#239;&#188;&#159;&#230;&#151;&#165;&#230;&#156;&#172;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#145;&#137;&#230;&#155;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#141;&#176;&#229;&#136;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

If he had died at Saratoga instead of being seriously wounded, his legacy would have been nothing short of legendary.&#10;&#10;Benedict Arnold and the Northern Theater is designed to provide players with a neglected yet important slice of history -- and, using the Do or Die Roll(TM) game system -- an easy-playing, exciting gaming experience for both experienced wargamers and newbies alike.&#10;&#10;Now in development with a well-known, respected publisher!&#10;&#10;&#10;Update 1/9/18: unfortunately, for various reasons the production of this game has been canceled. There may be some interest from another publisher, so cross your fingers. Meanwhile, I've uploaded all the files to the game as print-and-play.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Players take the role of heroes that are working together to thwart the evil Foe. On their adventure the heroes will work together in an effort to bolster their party and fend off this powerful enemy. The players will harness mighty abilities and powerful equipment while they work as a team to rid the world of this wretched evil!&#10;&#10;Each round starts with the Foe, who is autonomous. The Foe has a set action it takes each turn, and then plays cards from its deck. The cards in the Foe deck include Vassals under its employ that also fight the Heroes, as well as powerful abilities that the Foe will use to damage and weaken the Heroes. At the end of the Foe phase, the party of Heroes may collectively choose a card in the city to refresh, making other options available for the next turn.&#10;&#10;After the Foe phase is complete, the party of Heroes begin their turns. Turn order starts with whoever the party selects. Each Hero turn plays out very simply, they can play a card from their hand, buy a card from the city (using their experience), and use one of their heroic Feats. Each Hero has a completely unique starting deck and plays totally different from each other Hero!&#10;&#10;Play continues until the Foe is defeated or the party is destroyed, whichever happens first. In Foe Hunters, players don't use cards to buy cards like most deck building games. Each Hero has their own experience pool that they draw upon to purchase cards, and when these cards are purchased they go directly to hand instead of to your discard pile. This allows you to get answers for problems when you need them.&#10;&#10;The deck building element in Foe Hunters revolves around the City Deck. This deck has several cards that are available for purchase. Many of these cards have a class affinity, which allows the Hero that matches the class to purchase the card for a discount.&#10;&#10;Foe Hunters is a new take on co-op that mixes a lightweight system with the complexity of an in-depth deck building game or card game!&#10;&#10;",

The only problem is that when money is no object what could you possibly wager with? Well winning a hand in Samuel Sandwich may be more literal than you might think.&#10;&#10;Samuel Sandwich is designed for 2 to 4 players&#10;The game consists of cards, playmats, counters and coins.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt a hand of &ldquo;doings &amp; deeds&rdquo; cards each of theses cards has a selection of color coded words which are used to construct a story. These cards also contain a custom Samuel Sandwich suit and a point value so that at the end of each round your point total can be determined.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the round a &ldquo;consorts &amp; cohorts&rdquo; card is flipped to reveal a famous historical figure. This person will be the subject of everyone&rsquo;s  story as they try to outplay each other. There are 2 wagering rounds one when the &ldquo;consorts &amp; cohorts&rdquo; card is revealed and then again when players select and place the cards they will be using face down on the table.&#10;after wagering is resolved players take turns revealing and telling their story to the group. After everyone has told their tall tale the points are added up and the winner takes the money bet during this round as well as all cards played during the round (minus their own).&#10;&#10;Feeling hungry?&#10;&#10;Winning A Hand&#10;After winning a round a player may then select one part of another player to eat. The correct counter is removed from that persons player mat and is placed in the stomach of the round winner.&#10;&#10;Trading In&#10;Players may also trade in 10 doings and deeds cards they have won from other players to select an additional part to eat.&#10;&#10;Selling Off&#10;If a player finds themselves low on funds at any time in the game they may sell off a part to the highest bidder in order to replenish their financial stockpile to continue wagering.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game the player who has eaten the most is declared the winner. &#10;The key to success is not what you eat, it&rsquo;s who you eat and how much!&#10;&#10;",

Each player uses one of four dice (4-sided, 6-sided, 8-sided, 12-sided) during the game to try to acquire marine life cards from the five ocean zones.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player rolls their die, pays to reroll (if desired), asks for die help from others (paying if their dice are used), then collects all the fish in one ocean zone that correspond to the die total. If the player collects marine life needed to complete a mission card, the player can discard one life card to score those points. They can buy new mission cards for $3, with a maximum of four cards in hand. (If a player acquires marine life they don't want, they can sell it for $3 million; penguins bring in $5 million.)&#10;&#10;Every $5 million in hand is worth 1 point, and players race to collect 15 points first. Whoever does so wins!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "A mysterious dungeon emerged from the middle of the continent with great power to summon creatures and control them. All nearby kingdoms have sent heroes. Some are here to destroy the dungeon, some to take that great power. You are one of these heroes. By your king's order, you must defeat all other heroes and monopolize this dungeon.&#10;&#10;The dungeon will help you summon powerful creatures, but you need an altar to do this &mdash; and if you lose your altars, you can hardly survive this battle. By the same token, you can dominate this dungeon by conquering your enemies' altars. You can also collect victory points by destroying the enemies themselves. Making the most powerful army is one way to win. Now it's time to begin the battle!&#10;&#10;GSBM (Great Strategy of Battle Monsters) is a fantasy-based strategy game that gives you extreme freedom to maximize your strategic choices and control the game. Each player forms an army of monsters to compete with other players in phases such as Produce, Summon, Move, Battle, and Conquer; each monster has its own unique skill, allowing you to devise clever strategies by combining it with other skills or tactic cards. Players must manage their resources, action points and five mana elements: water, fire, air, earth, and ether. Using these resources effectively is the key to victory. Players must also use field effects, elemental superiority, unit type differences (infantry/archer/cavalry/flyer), joint attacks, and joint defense to their advantage.&#10;&#10;The game offers several victory conditions, so each player can take strategic approaches to different victories based on how the game plays out. The game field is randomized for each new game, altering territorial dynamics between players and providing near-infinite start settings. As players become more skilled with the game, their tactics and strategy develop, allowing them to play against others with more unique and original play styles.&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;GSBM&#236;&#157;&#128; &#237;&#140;&#144;&#237;&#131;&#128;&#236;&#167;&#128; &#236;&#132;&#184;&#234;&#179;&#132;&#234;&#180;&#128;&#236;&#157;&#132; &#235;&#176;&#176;&#234;&#178;&#189;&#236;&#156;&#188;&#235;&#161;&#156; &#237;&#149;&#156; 2~8&#236;&#157;&#184;&#236;&#154;&#169; &#236;&#160;&#132;&#235;&#158;&#181; &#234;&#178;&#140;&#236;&#158;&#132;&#236;&#156;&#188;&#235;&#161;&#156;&#236;&#132;&#156; &#236;&#181;&#156;&#235;&#140;&#128;&#237;&#149;&#156;&#236;&#157;&#152; &#236;&#158;&#144;&#236;&#156;&#160;&#235;&#143;&#132; &#235;&#176;&#143; &#235;&#172;&#180;&#237;&#149;&#156;&#237;&#149;&#156; &#237;&#153;&#149;&#236;&#158;&#165;&#236;&#132;&#177;&#236;&#157;&#132; &#235;&#176;&#148;&#237;&#131;&#149;&#236;&#156;&#188;&#235;&#161;&#156;, &#234;&#178;&#140;&#236;&#157;&#180;&#235;&#168;&#184;&#236;&#157;&#152; &#234;&#178;&#140;&#236;&#158;&#132; &#236;&#167;&#128;&#235;&#176;&#176;&#235;&#160;&#165;&#234;&#179;&#188; &#236;&#160;&#132;&#235;&#158;&#181;&#236;&#160;&#129; &#236;&#132;&#160;&#237;&#131;&#157;&#234;&#176;&#128;&#235;&#138;&#165;&#236;&#132;&#177;&#236;&#157;&#132; &#234;&#183;&#185;&#235;&#140;&#128;&#237;&#153;&#148;&#237;&#149;&#156; &#236;&#158;&#145;&#237;&#146;&#136;&#236;&#158;&#133;&#235;&#139;&#136;&#235;&#139;&#164;. &#237;&#149;&#184;&#235;&#147;&#156;&#236;&#153;&#128; &#237;&#149;&#132;&#235;&#147;&#156; &#234;&#180;&#128;&#235;&#166;&#172;, &#235;&#167;&#136;&#235;&#130;&#152; &#234;&#180;&#128;&#235;&#166;&#172;, &#236;&#138;&#185;&#236;&#160;&#144; &#234;&#180;&#128;&#235;&#166;&#172;, &#236;&#134;&#140;&#237;&#153;&#152; &#234;&#177;&#176;&#236;&#160;&#144; &#234;&#180;&#128;&#235;&#166;&#172; &#235;&#147;&#177;&#236;&#157;&#152; &#236;&#151;&#172;&#235;&#159;&#172; &#236;&#154;&#148;&#236;&#134;&#140;&#234;&#176;&#128; &#234;&#178;&#140;&#236;&#158;&#132;&#236;&#151;&#144; &#235;&#133;&#185;&#236;&#149;&#132; &#236;&#158;&#136;&#236;&#138;&#181;&#235;&#139;&#136;&#235;&#139;&#164;. &#236;&#157;&#180;&#235;&#147;&#164;&#236;&#157;&#132; &#234;&#183;&#160;&#237;&#152;&#149;&#236;&#158;&#136;&#234;&#178;&#140; &#236;&#156;&#160;&#236;&#167;&#128;&#237;&#149;&#180;&#236;&#149;&#188;&#235;&#167;&#140; &#235;&#167;&#136;&#235;&#178;&#149;&#236;&#167;&#132;&#236;&#151;&#144;&#236;&#132;&#156;  &#236;&#138;&#185;&#235;&#166;&#172;&#236;&#157;&#152; &#236;&#152;&#129;&#234;&#180;&#145;&#236;&#157;&#132; &#235;&#136;&#140;&#235;&#166;&#172; &#236;&#136;&#152; &#236;&#158;&#136;&#236;&#157;&#132; &#234;&#178;&#131;&#236;&#158;&#133;&#235;&#139;&#136;&#235;&#139;&#164;.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In this exciting, fast paced card game, players are competing against each other to acquire as many cards from their opponents as possible! Some cards are worth more than others though, so be strategic about which cards you decide to &ldquo;Swipe&rdquo; from your foes!&#10;&#10;The game is played in rounds, and in one single round only four &quot;Master Points&quot; are available for players to win, either splitting the points between the players, or one player winning them all. Rounds continue until a single player reaches five Master Points, in which they win the game. The four Master Points in any given round consist of the following: 1) Master Number Point 2) Master Color Point 3) Master Shape Point and 4) Master Total Point.&#10;&#10;The game starts out with the dealer revealing the &quot;Master Card&quot; for that round (which is a Power Card that gets placed in the center of the playing field). The Master Card will have a number (1-10), a color (red,blue,purple,green), and a shape (X,O). Whatever the elements might be are what dictate the four ways to earn the &quot;Master Points&quot; in that round. For example: If the dealer reveals the Master Card that has the number 7, the color red, and the shape X, then players must steal cards from each other that have any of those elements (7s, reds, X's) and always high numbered cards. At the end of a round, players will reveal to each other all of the cards they have acquired throughout the round. In this example, the player who acquired the most cards with the number 7 wins the Master Number Point, the player who acquired the most cards with the color red wins the Master Color Point, the player who acquired the most cards with the shape X wins the Master Shape Point, and the player who acquired the highest sum after adding up the numbers on all acquired cards wins the Master Total Point.&#10;&#10;There are only two main types of cards in Swipe it!&trade; There are the Power Cards (cards with a number, a color, and a shape; one of these cards gets promoted to master card at the beginning of the round) and then there are the Swipe Cards which have an &quot;S&quot; and a swipe arrow . Players need to combine one of each type of cards in order to initiate an attack against another player. Players can only acquire Power Cards from each other in order to gain points, where Swipe Cards simply allow the player's Power Cards to make an attack. In Swipe it!&trade; a combined pair (a Power Card combined with a Swipe Card) can always freely attack a lower numbered Power Card or enemy pair. Example: a 10 on a Black Swipe Card can freely attack an opponent's 9 on a Black Swipe Card). Now the intensity rises when you are using a combined pair to attack a higher numbered Power Card or enemy pair. This is where the dice and rock-paper-scissors comes into effect, where essentially the attacker is wagering their lower numbered Power Card in a series of battles against their opponent's higher numbered Power Card. If the attacker loses, their opponent acquires the attacker's Power Card in play. This is especially huge when the attacker is risking their Power Card that happens to match the &quot;Master Number&quot;, &quot;Master Color&quot;, &quot;Master Shape&quot;, or is a high numbered card like a 9 or 10. On the other hand, if the attacker is wagering a Power Card that is low like the number 1 and does not match any of the Master Point categories, then who cares if they lose to their enemy right? The attacker may as well take the risk with that type of card in order try and win a great one.&#10;&#10;There are also three different types of Swipe Cards (Black, Silver, and Gold) each one offering unique abilities; such as the Gold Swipe Card raising your Power card by +2 when it is attacking and by +1 when on defense, or the Silver Swipe Card granting the ability to &quot;Punish&quot; another player's Swipe Card, or being able to &quot;Reassign&quot; a combined pair with a different Power card (if you had a 1 combined with Silver Swipe Card, you can switch it to lets say a 10 on the Silver Swipe Card allowing you to attack higher numbered enemy cards for free). There are also some special rules too, such as &quot;merge&quot;, &quot;master merge&quot;, and &quot;cash-in&quot; which can help players out of some sticky situations. A &quot;merge&quot; allows you to combine two Power Cards that share the same number (such as combining a 9 with another 9), forcing the combined cards to act as if it were a Black Swipe card, giving you the ability to combine a third Power Card to it to make an attack. &quot;Master merge&quot; is the same as a &quot;merge&quot; with the exception that the combined cards match the &quot;Master Number&quot; in play, forcing them to act as if it were a Gold Swipe Card. Lastly, the &quot;cash-in&quot; action allows a player to discard two alike Swipe Cards (such as discarding two Black Swipe Cards) to receive one new card from the dealer. This action can only be done once per turn, so if you were hoping for a particular card, you will not be able to cash in another pair of Swipe Cards until the dealer makes its way around to you again.&#10;&#10;The round ends once the dealer has dealt the last card, and the player dealt the last card takes their final turn. All players discard any remaining face up cards. They then flip over all acquired face down cards and determine the winners of the 4 Master Points for the round in this order; Master Number, Master Color, Master Shape, Master Total.&#10;&#10;",

Earth Encounters brings the Einstein in all of us to life. It&rsquo;s not only fun to play, but it sparks dialog among friends, brings value to our community, and perhaps can even change our world for the better! Earth Encounters is anti-trivia.&#10;&#10;The game starts with the Timeship Encounter. An alien creature escaped the timeship and is hiding somewhere in the Eastern Time Zone. Encounter launches an elite team to recapture the alien creature. Players travel across the U.S. and the seven continents, competing to be the first to locate and capture the powerful yet invisible alien before it awakens and consumes all the knowledge possessed by Earth&rsquo;s inhabitants. Throughout this adventure, each player learns about the states and continents as they collect as many states and continent deeds as possible &ndash; they&rsquo;ll be needed when you come face-to-face with the alien creature.&#10;&#10;Each player can only advance by correctly answering a question from the Q&amp;A Deck or successfully completing a thought experiment from the Challenge Deck.   In doing so, if they are the first to land on that particular state or continent, they are awarded a State Deed of Trust.  That means the state or continent is now under the players protection from the alien. The player who protects the state where the alien is hiding is considered the winner!&#10;&#10;",

It's a short, brutal three laps as you jockey for position, ram your opponents, and leverage bonuses and your titan's abilities to race across the finish line!&#10;&#10;The game board is an infinite circuit that wraps around at opposite sides. Each circuit has specific features that allow for interesting tactical maneuvers. Movement is governed by drafting dice from a pool rolled at the beginning of each round. If you choose a die that matches the color of your titan, you regain a life point.&#10;&#10;When you ram into another titan by moving into the same space, you push that titan and deal them damage. There are also ways to lay traps on the circuit that will damage titans who encounter them. If you get KO'd due to taking too much damage, you'll spend a turn resetting right where you were knocked out, but you're not out of the race.&#10;&#10;Each titan has a special ability that can be activated once each round. Moving into certain bonus spaces on the circuit also grant players bonus cards that can be played for additional effects.&#10;&#10;",

Each token in the game bag has two questions &ndash; one on each side, and each question has two options &ndash; This or That. Most of the questions give you a choice between things you might like, such as &ldquo;Pumpkin Pie or S&rsquo;Mores?&rdquo;. Other questions might give you a choice between things you might not enjoy, such as &ldquo;Smelly or Slimy?&rdquo;. In either case, you might really like both of the answers, or neither of them. That&rsquo;s the catch &ndash; you HAVE to pick one answer!&#10;Players take turns drawing tokens from the bag. Silently read your token and decide which side you want to answer. Read that question out loud. Decide what your answer is but don&rsquo;t say it out loud! Each players guesses what they think your answer is. After all the players have guessed, reveal your answer and be honest! If you draw a black All Play token, read the question out loud, and everyone takes turns sharing their answer to the question.&#10;&#10;Keep the token you drew and pass the bag along to the next player. The game ends when everyone has five This or That? tokens in front of them.&#10;&#10;",

Each turn a player gets a random number of command points to spend on musketeers and cannons firing and on pikemen and cavalry moving and assaulting.&#10;&#10;Combat is deterministic; the result depends on the formation the defender is in and the status of the defender and any neighboring units. E.g., a lone defender or one at the end of a line is disrupted (or eliminated if already disrupted), but one with two undisrupted neighbors merely retreats. The neighboring units may suffer effects as well.&#10;&#10;Optional rules allow for different ways of using the command points and the possibility of saving them from turn to turn.&#10;&#10;",

There are numerous event cards which affect the proceedings.&#10;&#10;This edition makes some significant changes, among which are:&#10;&#10;     The game can be played with up to eight players, although play mats for just six are provided.&#10;     The alternate winning conditions (11 million flock or 117 council votes) have been eliminated.&#10;     The game ends when the creed is complete or when the event deck is exhausted.&#10;     The creed is divided into 13 articles instead of 10, and there are furthermore additional optional articles (designated X, Y, and Z) which the Emperor can choose to vote on at any time. (Consequently, players can have up to 12 articles on their mats instead of 9.)&#10;     All flock cards have the same value.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

A massive MoonQuake grants you sudden freedom from your captivity, but there's only one way to Escape--the last rescue rocket, and you need to reach it before the other players.  Use the rotating and revolving 3D moon to gather charges and decide which actions will best meet your goal: finding and stopping others players, readying or stealing key equipment, or finding better ways to hide.  Along the treacherous journey, watch out for shifting and dangerous terrain, out of control defenses, and a relentless prison guard that are out to end your sentence--for life!&#10;&#10;Finding and stopping the other players is your best plan, but each is hiding amongst decoys and traps.  Player interaction focuses on a risk fraught variation of the classic 3-card Monte combined with a thematic &quot;Bluffing&quot; component that completely reverses the &quot;Take That&quot; mechanic.  Can you use protective shields to lure opponents into picking the wrong hiding spot and keep your own plan from backfiring?  Reach the rocket and prepare for a climactic battle--will you be prepared to capitalize on unexpected turn of events? Be the first to launch during the MoonQuake and you've Escaped the competition!&#10;&#10;",

Gameplay involves playing cards from your hand that match those being performed in the currently playing matches on your television (if the match you're watching has Shawn Michaels using a dropkick, you can play Dropkick).&#10;&#10;The goal is to pin your opponent of course, by playing the correct cards/sequences to end the match.&#10;&#10;",

Orctions occur when a player decides to visit the city of Ve'Tath during the worker placement rounds. Orctions are in 6 different styles. Once one player has the designated number of sets they win stage one of the game and then decide which pairs of other players must fight in the dice combat game in the arena until there is only one Orc left alive. The player who has this Orc is the winner of the entire game.&#10;&#10;",

In this cut-throat world of culinary competition, Tasting Spoons are your currency, your Warming Tray may be your greatest asset or your worst nightmare, and a simple dash of Salt may just be what you need to tip the balance in your favor and win the game.&#10;&#10;On their turns, Players use their Tasting Spoons, and Forks, to purchase Ingredients available in the Marketplace. Ingredients are added to their decks, or placed into their Warming Trays, and Players use those Ingredients to submit Dishes to Judges. Those Judges reward the Player with Medals, as well as passive abilities that could turn the tide of the game. The Player with the most Medals wins the game.&#10;&#10;Cuisine a la Card is fast-paced and challenging as Players have to constantly manage their decks and shift strategies to outwit their opponent and ensure that they are the winning Chef.&#10;&#10;",

Every single strike there's a chance to lose your head, adding a suspenseful life-threatening urgency to every move!&#10;&#10;The game is simple.  Like in the classic black knight fight scene from Monty Python and the Holy Grail, each player fights until they lose all their limbs, or lose their head.  Play cards to fight and confuse your opponent.  Roll the dice to charge and retreat.  And draw from the bag o' death to see what body part gets cut off.&#10;&#10;The Nobles can be played with two players in a one-on-one duel, or with three to four players in a free-for-all death match, or played with teams (2-on-2 or even 3-on-1).&#10;&#10;With a mix of strategy and luck, games can average around 20-30 minutes, or can be over in as little as 60 seconds.  We've played a lot of games and only once witnessed a killing blow in the first turn, but boy was it satisfying.  Boom... head shot!&#10;&#10;",

One wrong step, or one misplaced accusation, and you could be the next witch to hang. &quot;Salem&quot; takes players into this perilous world and lets them re-live the tension, politics, and religious extremism that still has people talking about it 300 years later.&#10;&#10;The game is packaged in a faux book box that closes magnetically. The game, disguised as a worn out leather book, can easily hide on your bookshelf and masquerade as an antique.&#10;&#10;Players can play as prominent villagers from the old Salem town, and even read their bios in the instruction manual. The servant girl Mary Warren, pastor Samuel Parris, farmer John Proctor, storyteller Tituba, and beggar Sarah Good are some of the 12 characters featured in the game.&#10;&#10;Players, each acting as one of these unique characters, are given 3-5 Tryal cards (depending on the number of players). These Tryal cards reveal the true identity of each player, &quot;Witch&quot; or &quot;Not a Witch.&quot;&#10;&#10;During gameplay, players gather cards that they use to accuse, or defend, other players. Deciding who to trust is key to survival, since you can never play a card on yourself. When you suspect someone to be a witch, you can begin accusing them with red accusation cards. When enough accusations have been placed on one of the players, the player who lays the final accusation chooses one of that player's Tryal cards to reveal. Once all &quot;Witch&quot; Tryal cards have been found, the villagers of Salem win.&#10;&#10;Players can also use green and blue cards such as &quot;Alibi&quot;, &quot;Stocks&quot;, &quot;Matchmaker&quot;, &quot;Asylum&quot;, and &quot;Scapegoat&quot; to help or hurt their allies or enemies.&#10;&#10;As players draw cards, they will eventually draw black cards that take immediate effect. One black card, &quot;Night&quot;, forces all players to close their eyes while the Witches choose someone to eliminate and the Constable chooses someone to potentially save. The other black card, &quot;Conspiracy,&quot; forces all players to take a face-down Tryal card from the player to their left. Killing witches quickly is essential, otherwise &quot;Conspiracy&quot; may soon have the whole town turned evil.&#10;&#10;Before long, accusations will be flying, and screams of &quot;She's a WITCH!&quot; will wake the neighbours. Will you be the hero who purges your town of witches, or will you be wrongly accused and hung for witchcraft? Or perhaps you will be a witch yourself, escape conviction, and bring Salem to the ground.&#10;&#10;Volume 1 in the Dark Cities Series by Facade Games.&#10;&#10;",

A max of 5 Tribesmen can be in the player's area. Players can also swap out Tribesmen during this phase (discarding the one they replaced). Tribesmen are required to build buildings and also activate Attack/Magic cards.&#10;    Phase 3 (Construction) - Players can build one Building from the Building Option line if their Tribesmen colors match the Building's requirements. Building special abilities also take place during this phase.&#10;    Phase 4 (Action) - Players can play any Attack or Magic cards in hand if they have more Warrior(Attack) or Shaman(Magic) cards than their target. These allow the player to destroy, steal from  and generally muck with the targeted opponent.&#10;&#10;&#10;At the end of the 4th phase, the player trims his hand down to 5 cards and play continues with the next player. The players try to build 4 building and 1 palace (which must be built last). The first player to build the palace wins.&#10;&#10;",

The game world is further fleshed out in other Magical Legend comics and novels.&#10;&#10;There are 2 game modes.&#10;&#10;Game Mode 1 (Deities vs Demons): &#10;Gameplay-wise this is similar to Bang. There are 3 roles (Deity, Demons, Spirits). The Deity wins if he kills all Demons and non-subjugated Spirits. The Demons win if they kill the Deity. The Spirits win if they kill the Deity and 1 Demon or 1 Spirit who has killed a Demon. The Deity has 3 power up cards which he can offer as a reward to subjugate(ie. ally) a Spirit. Spirits can renege on the alliance/subjugation but will suffer penalties for doing so. The game replaces the suits (Heart, Spades, etc) of Bang with a 5-element system (Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth) and characters, abilities and card actions vary depending on the elements involved. There is no concept of Distance and no Missed cards. Attacks succeed or are countered based on the elements. Card actions often require Magic points to power them. Otherwise the gameplay is quite similar.&#10;&#10;Game Mode 2 (Faction Battles):&#10;This mode can only be played with an even number of players (4-10). Players split into 2 camps and a representative from each camp draw 1 of 5 faction cards to see what faction they are. Factions have specific powers which can be triggered to allow cooperation between members of the faction. There are no hidden roles in this mode and all players of a faction win if the other faction is eliminated. Other aspects of gameplay (ie. drawing, attacking, etc) are similar to game mode 1.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Become a witch and enter the medieval world of Wickersby in this worker placement, resource management game with spellcasting! Make villagers fall in love, turn them into frogs, or teleport them to different locations. Use your familiars to gather ingredients and cast spells on the villagers to achieve goals and score victory points as you vie to be named the village crone.&#10;&#10;All the players are witches who have come upon a medieval village without a crone. They send out familiars to gather ingredients they can use in spells to complete Witch's Scheme cards. Each of the cards is worth 1, 2, or 3 points, which also indicates how difficult the scheme is to complete. The witch who scores 13 points wins.&#10;&#10;The village consists of 6 location game boards: village green, lord's manor, farm, mill, forge, and tithe barn. The locations are modular and can be placed in any order or configuration as long as the gridlines line up. (The easiest way to play is with a 3x2 retangular configuration.)&#10;&#10;The villagers, who are the most frequent targets of the Witch's Schemes, have starting locations. The peasant begins in the village green, the lord in the lord's manor, the farmer in the farm, the miller in the mill, the blacksmith in the forge, and the priest in the tithe barn.&#10;&#10;The ingredients can be found at 4 of the 6 locations. Silver is in the lord's manor, soil in the farm, flour in the mill, and fire in the forge. There are also 3 eye of newt cards in each stack of ingredients and can be used as wild cards in spells.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt 1 of each of the 3 levels of Witch's Scheme cards. Consulting their Books of Spells (which are the same for each witch) to determine which ingredients will be needed to cast the spells on their Witch's Scheme cards, they put 1 familiar in the village green, take turns placing 2 additional familiars in other locations, and draw 2 ingredients from those locations.&#10;&#10;The first step in the order of play is to tithe. As soon as each player knows which ingredient they will sacrifice, they place it facedown in the tithe barn. This seeds the tithe barn with ingredients that can be gleaned with the Fortune spell (which allows a player to draw any 3 ingredients from the tithe barn). However, any player who placed a familiar in the tithe barn does not have to tithe.&#10;&#10;Then, in turn order, players may move their own familiars and/or villagers and cast spells. (Spells may be cast for strategic or tactical purposes as well as to complete Witch's Schemes.) The movement is limited to a total of 6 spaces, and the number of spells is limited only by the ingredients the player has. The movement and spellcasting can be in any order on a player's turn. A player can even intersperse movement and spellcasting. If a player completes a Witch's Scheme, the card is turned over so that the other players can clearly see how many points that player has. After he/she is finished moving and casting spells, he/she draws 1 of each of the 3 levels of cards, reads them, and decides which one(s) to add to his/her hand as replacements.&#10;&#10;When all players have finished moving and casting spells, the players harvest 2 ingredients for each familiar in a location, and the broom (which indicates the first player) is moved clockwise.&#10;&#10;The spells are Conjuring (to add up to 2 more familiars into play), Love (to join the fates of 2 villagers, meaning spells cast on one affect the other and movement of one moves the other), Transformation (to turn a villager into a frog or vice versa), Binding (to lock a location down and prevent anyone or anything from entering or leaving a location), Switching (to change the place of 2 familiars and/or villagers), Summoning (to cause a villager to move to a location containing one of the player's familiars), Fortune (to allow a player to draw any 3 ingredients from the tithe barn), and Protection (to block a spell cast by another player). 1 silver can also be used to complete a Scheme out of turn or to discard and draw a new Witch's Scheme card. Each spell requires not only ingredients but also an incantation, which is provided in the Book of Spells. Alternatively, players can make up their own incantations. If a player is caught trying to complete a spell without speaking the incantation, the spell does not work.&#10;&#10;Each witch has access to the same number of starting familiars, the same ingredients, the same spells, and 3 Schemes of the same level. But the witch who most cleverly uses these resources to reach 13 points is named the village crone.&#10;&#10;The Village Crone also includes rules for solitaire play.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "&quot;Prussia 20&quot; features two complete wargames covering key battles fought in Central Europe during the 1806-1807 War of the Fourth Coalition: Jena 20 2nd Edition, and Eylau 20!&#10;&#10;Jena 20 2nd Edition (October, 1806) highlights the stunning French victory which shattered the vaunted Prussian army at the twin battles of Jena and Auerstadt. With the Prussians realizing they have already been out maneuvered, their army is desperately trying to re-position itself while the French attempt to encircle and destroy them. Can the Prussian rear guard under Hohenlohe hold off Napoleon's Grand Arm&eacute;e long enough at Jean to allow Brunswick's main body to crush Davout's lone French corps under which blocks their path to safety, or will the &quot;Iron Marshal's&quot; veteran 3rd Corps stand firm against three times their numbers and seal the Prussian's doom? The fate of two great empires is yours to decide.&#10;&#10;Fought in some of the most severe weather conditions imaginable, the confused and indecisive battle of Eylau 20! (February, 1807) stands as a testament to the misery and horror of warfare. In the dead of winter, Russian General Levin August von Bennigsen halted his exhausted army at a small deserted crossroads village and prepared to give battle. For two days, in sub-zero temperatures with heavy snow falling almost continuously, Napoleon's troops battered themselves against the unyielding Russian lines to little avail. Is the historical bloody and inconclusive draw the most likely outcome, or can you do better than the actual commanders and manage to eke out a victory in the terrible &quot;Battle in a Blizzard?&quot;&#10;&#10;",

In Epic, you take on the role of an elder god, in conflict with other elder gods. The cards in your deck are your champions, who fight for you, and events, which represent your will imposed on the mortal realm.   In Epic, the turn sequence is easy but there are many options to choose from. You begin the game with a hand of five cards &ndash; each card costs either one gold or is free. You get one gold each turn &mdash; you don&rsquo;t need to draw special resource cards or energy cards just to play with your other cards. Instead of figuring out which cards you might be allowed to play, you choose which card you want to play.&#10;&#10;Epic is non-collectable, so every box contains the same 120 unique event and champion cards, with 8 double-sided cards to represent temporary &quot;token&quot; champions. One box supports preconstructed, sealed and draft formats for 2-4 players, two boxes up to 8 players, and three if you want to create a full constructed deck or a &quot;cube&quot; environment for drafting.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Mangaka: The Fast &amp; Furious Game of Drawing Comics is a creative fast-paced card game in which players draw comic stories over four rounds combining Themes &amp; an ever-growing number of Trends.&#10;&#10;Players start by drawing three Theme Cards (such as &quot;Kaiju/Giant Monsters&quot;, &quot;Robots and Androids,&quot; or &quot;Desire to be a Parent&quot;) to determine the subject matter of their comic. (These three Themes stick with the player throughout the game. Many but not all of the Themes have a manga/anime/Japanese flavor.) Then each player chooses a title and &quot;pen name.&quot;&#10;&#10;After players have had a few minutes to brainstorm, the five-minute timer is activated and core gameplay begins. Players have five minutes to draw their comics (on pre-printed Comic Pages) and express their Themes. When time is up, each player takes a turn reading their comic to the group (or, in the suggested 'professional mode,' the other players read the player's manga amongst themselves without the artist being allowed to give explanation). Based on the other players' judgement, each player earns 2 Fame Tokens for following each of the three core rules: (1) express your Themes (2) use 3 or fewer Word Balloons and (3) draw something recognizable in every Panel.&#10;&#10;Beginning with round 2, Trend Cards appear, putting more Fame in play. Trend cards (examples: Science Fiction, Fantasy, Shojo Manga, Sports, Destruction, Subtlety, etc.) provide new victory conditions in the form of instructions and a corresponding reward of Fame Tokens. Some Trend rewards can be claimed by every player simultaneously, others can only be claimed by one or two winners (such as &quot;Eager Audience,&quot; which rewards Fame to the first player to finish drawing before time runs out).&#10;&#10;In addition, each round after the 1st, the Comic Pages become denser, requiring the players to draw more Panels in the same amount of time. Round 1 is 2 Panels; round 2 is 4 Panels; round 3 is 6 Panels; round 4 is 8 Panels. The number of Trends also goes up from round to round. Round 2 has 1 Trend; round 3 has 2 Trends; round 4 has 4 Trends.&#10;&#10;When round 4 ends, the winner (the most successful comic artist) is the one with the most Fame.&#10;&#10;",

The winner is the player with more successful defenses.&#10;&#10;DRAGON GAME: 2&ndash;4 players | 20&ndash;40 minutes | ages 9+&#10;In this cooperative mode, the keepers work together to defend and train the dragons so that they attack the hunter. Players can take four different actions: Defend, Cure, Train and Attack. Those actions are limited and they need to cooperate and organized as a group to manage to stop the hunter's attacks during the game. The players lose if a dragon is killed by the hunter, or if the battle event deck runs out. The players win if X dragons (where X is determined by the difficulty level) manage to successfully attack the hunter.&#10;&#10;",

You play the Goblins, these small Breton goblins, who will build their dolmen picking up the slabs arranged in a circle around the stone table.&#10;&#10;GOAL OF THE GAME&#10;&#10;The goal is to have the most points in its own construction at the end of the game. It stops when a player has 7 tiles in its dolmen.&#10;&#10;In a turn, players will either move their korrigan AND watch a slab OR try to add a tile to their dolmen AND watch a slab&#10;&#10;A korrigan moves from 0 to 3 (without rolling the dice) on the light points around the circle in any direction.&#10;&#10;Each tile has a colored light on two of its sides. Arranged on the circle early in the game, the face of each slab has points (2 to 6). These will serve as the final countdown to determine the winner.&#10;&#10;To add a stone to the dolmen, the korrigan must be in front of it and one of the colored sides of the stone must be the same color as the ends of the dolmen.&#10;&#10;The player rolls the dice and if the result is more than the score of the slab, it can be placed by matching lights. &#10;If the dice score is not enough, you need to consume power points symbolized by colored gems and give the difference on the stone table of the fairy.&#10;&#10;To recover its power points, the player must go see the fairy. This will also take the opportunity to replace the stones around the circle.&#10;&#10;As soon as a dolmen is finished, each player counts his points (even those with incomplete dolmen) and adds the unused points of powers. The winner is the one with the highest score.&#10;&#10;Warning, this is not necessarily the fastest who is the winner ...&#10;&#10;",

Distraught about never being able to be with the man she truly loved, she killed herself, but death could not hold her in the grave.

This is accomplished with small icon decks called &quot;Halots&quot;.&#10;&#10;Action action decks contain either enemies or Items that can be gathered to help in encounters. At certain points of the game, &quot;Happenstance&quot; cards will sometimes hinder players actions whereas Character cards present helpful traits.&#10;&#10;Silvanus is a versatile game, many of the components can be added or adjusted to fit a desired difficulty for players. There are optional modes of play such as allotted moves instead of real time play, and more. Short story snippets are included in the rules to give players a glimpse of Silvanus lore.&#10;&#10;",

Following that campaign Washington was chased out of New York into New Jersey with the British storming across the Hudson in hot pursuit.  Trenton 1776 is that campaign. One where all seemed lost.  One described as the &quot;the times that tried men's souls.&quot;  One where Washington the hunted became the hunter in a miracle winter campaign across New Jersey.  One that saved the Revolution.&#10;&#10;Can you do the same playing Washington or as British General Howe can  you cross the frozen Delaware, take Philadelphia and finish off your nemesis from New York?&#10;&#10;Trenton 1776 has a campaign game that covers the entire campaign from  the chase of Washington across New Jersey, his refuge behind the Delaware river and the winter battles that reversed his fortunes.  Also included in the game are shorter scenarios; Christmas surprise: Trenton December 25/26 1776 and Bagging the Fox: Trenton and Princeton January 2/3 1777.&#10;&#10;The game has an easy rules set, playtime of 2 hours or less, and the pleasure of using wooden blocks for units.  Wooden blocks provide a &ldquo;fog of war,&rdquo; and can be rotated during battles to keep track of losses easily.  Series rules are based on New York 1776 game system so game mechanics will be familiar to owners of that game, though both games play very differently.&#10;&#10;",

In order to keep its vast territories under control, the Roman Empire sent out state managers to exercise its policies.&#10;&#10;The players are one of these managers, in charge of one of the Roman cities, all aiming to become a prosperous and important city, like Rome, the glorious capital. Only the player who develops his city best, will earn the favour of the goddess Minerva and win the game.&#10;&#10;The player who has the most Victory Points (VP) at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;In order to gain VPs, the players will build military facilities to earn military fame, develop cultural facilities to assist cultural activities, and construct temples and layout the city so that it is worthy of its temples.&#10;&#10;But all of this requires resources and gold. And only building impressive buildings won't get anyone far without any inhabitants. The players will have to build living quarters so that the other buildings can have an effect.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "You control a group of survivors, trying to reclaim the city from the infected. But who do you fear most? The infected or the Surviving?&#10;&#10;The game in a nutshell. You control a group of survivors, not just one ninja of the apocalypse. You control your team to try and take back as much of the city before the infection ends. &#10;Then you can reign as king over the post-apocalyptic city. So how do you do this?&#10;&#10;Each turn, each survivor has one action which can be spent on either &#10;&#10;    Moving &ndash; moving one hex &#10;    Reclaiming the building &ndash; Boarding up the windows so it is safe again and you can lay down your flag to claim your victory points &#10;    Searching rooms &ndash; Each building has a set number of rooms you can search. What will you find, supplies? Survivors? Or the dreaded 10 zombie card!&#10;    And if on a park (farm) tile, then you can farm &ndash; One survivor can choose to spend an action point to farm.&#10;&#10;&#10;Farming? I hear you ask, well in the game once you have reclaimed a park, it is used to produce food. You can spend food at the start of your turn to give 3 survivor 2 action points that turn making them &ldquo;well fed and ready for zombie carnage&rdquo; However you can actively farm a park tile, spending a survivors action point. &#10;This means that at the start of your next turn that farm produces 2 food instead of 1.&#10;&#10;Ending the game!&#10;&#10;The game can end in 4 ways: &#10;The research centre is reclaimed (the cure has been found and the outbreak is over) &#10;The military base is reclaimed (More guns than any one army could need, you are left with a city flooded with zombie soup) &#10;When a group of survivors has reclaimed and spends one turn actively farming 5 farms (who needs to worry about zombies when you have fresh veg and steak every day) &#10;Or finally if one player reaches 50 Victory points before any of the other conditions are met&#10;&#10;However it is the player with the most Victory points that reigns king. So be careful before you cure the infection.&#10;&#10;Victory Points&#10;&#10;So what is worth victory points: &#10;&#10;    Buildings - worth the number of victory points indicated by the yellow number in the top right corner. &#10;    Survivors &ndash; worth 1 victory point each &#10;    When the game ends every 2 supplies card is worth 1 Victory point&#10;&#10;&#10;What else can you use supplies for? &#10;Throughout the game you can trade in 2 of your supplies to give one survivor: &#10;&#10;    Armour &ndash; decrease an attackers dice roll by one &#10;    Weapon &ndash; Increase one of your attacking die rolls by one&#10;&#10;&#10;Or you can build a wall. A wall will stop zombies and must be destroyed by attacking survivors before they can pass.&#10;&#10;Combat&#10;&#10;Combat in Surviving is simple. Survivors attack first. You roll a die for each survivor. Each die roll of 4,5 or 6 kills a zombie. Then any zombies left roll a die each to attack the survivors. A zombie must roll a 5 or 6 to kill a survivor. &#10;Repeat until all zombies are dead or all survivors are dead or have run away.&#10;&#10;That is it. Simple rules so if someone hasn&rsquo;t played before they can jump in and within one or two goes they are as clued in as everyone.&#10;&#10;",

Alternatively, if they are not able to do that action, they draw a card. If they can play that card they do so, otherwise turn goes to the next player.&#10;&#10;The arrows on the house cards determine the direction the houses have to be played.&#10;&#10;A card with an arrow pointing up, allows for purple &quot;level&quot; cards to be played on top of it. Making the house into a tower. If a house/tower with several levels is topped with a big roof card. The next player has to draw cards equal to the number of levels the tower has.&#10;&#10;Cards with a cat on the roof allow you to play another card of the same roof color.&#10;&#10;Playing a &quot;Trulie&quot; card allows you to roll the dice to see what happens. This can be both good or bad for you.&#10;&#10;The first player to empty their hand of cards wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

When the disc lands, you can remove one card it touches from play, revealing it and returning it to its owner. If a player has no cards in play, they're out of the game.

Any number of players can conduct a campaign, in which each type of army has a different set of victory conditions. While holding off Rome's many enemies, the Roman players are also trying to defeat each other and ultimately become (and remain!) emperor.&#10;&#10;The Persians are trying to carve away provinces in the east and add them to the Sassanian monarchy. The barbarians are trying to raid and carry away as much loot as possible while amassing glory from victorious battles over any sort of enemy, even one's own tribe. Every battle is therefore a balancing act, in which the military and political context is constantly shifting.&#10; Aurelian can be played with miniatures, or with &quot;unit tiles&quot; on any flat surface, much in the same manner as Bl&uuml;cher's unit cards. The centerpiece of the game is the campaign, in which each player manages the fortunes of his character and faction, much in the manner of the campaigns in Maurice and Longstreet. &#10; Unlike most Ancients games, which attempt to span the millennia from Moses to Columbus, Aurelian concentrates on a specific period of roughly 70 years. Players fight a series of nine battles against a variety of enemies, often from one's own side. The composition of their armies changes. Veteran Roman legionaries become incresingly scarce and irreplaceable as the Roman players cobble together vexillations and recruit barbarian foedorati and tributarii. Will the Persians squander their expensive elite cataphracts and elephant units in early battles, or hold them in reserve? Will a barbarian warlord play it safe and not raid as deeply into the empire, at the risk of not bringing back enough treasure and glory to maintain the loyalty of his optimates?&#10;&#10;",

So keep an eye on his Lemon stacks and make sure you don't play a 3rd card of the same type.&#10;&#10;Each type of Lemon card in front of a player allows that player to play cards on his/her turn in a particular way. Which can be to his left or right, straight across or on his own stacks. On a player's turn he/she must choose one of the Lemon card stacks in front of him/herself and play cards as allowed by that card.&#10;&#10;To add a bit of suspense, when a player legally chooses to play a card in front of themself, it may be placed face down in their secret stash. When the game ends, these cards are added to the face up stacks, so you might not know how many pitchers of Lemonade have been made by a player until it's time to...  drink up.&#10;&#10;",

It&rsquo;s up to you and your rival archeologists to traverse the long forgotten tunnels, defeat monsters, and search for the vast treasures beyond your wildest dreams Before the tomb is once again lost to the sands of time.&#10;&#10;On each turn, a player rolls 1d6 to determine their movement to explore the tomb. The tomb itself is broken down into 3x3 square tiles that you draw randomly and add to the map as you go. Sometimes you might find a monster Hiding in the halls. These monsters are hoarding the treasures for themselves and it's up to you to defeat them by rolling a higher dice roll than their power level. Once the monster is defeated you get the treasure for yourself. Some of this treasure may help you in your adventure, or be a curse that hinders your progression.&#10;&#10;Be careful though. The tomb is only open for a limited time and anyone can trigger the collapse. Once the tomb collapses you have a limited amount of time to get back to the entrance. If you make it out then congratulations, count up your treasure. The archeologist with the most treasure wins! If you don't make it out, sorry about your luck. Maybe someday the tomb will be uncovered again and a future archeologist will find your corpse among a pile of valuable treasures.&#10;&#10;",

Then shuffle all of the market / price cards and deal the top five face up and place the rest in a deck face down (which I messed up for this picture, oops!). Each player gets all 5 of their specified meeple color.&#10;&#10;On each player's turn, they can take one of the following three actions:&#10;&#10;1) Place one of your meeples on any ONE mushroom card on mushroom mountain. The meeple must have both feet touching the card and must be STANDING in order to count. If it falls, I think you must remove it from mushroom mountain and your turn ends with no properly placed meeple mushroom hunters.&#10;&#10;2) Return any ONE of your meeples, along with the card it is standing on, to your play area. The number of mushrooms on the card is the number that you have collected.&#10;&#10;3) Return ALL of your meeples, along with the cards that they were standing on, to your play area. The number of mushrooms on ALL of these cards is the number that you have collected.&#10;&#10;At any time during your turn, you can cash in any amount of mushrooms you have collected during the current or previous turns for a market / price card.&#10;&#10;The game continues until either all of the market / sell cards have been taken by players, or all of the cards from mushroom mountain have been taken. Once the end is triggered, players count up their money and the player who has earned the most from their mushroom hunting adventure is declared the winner!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Der Gr&uuml;ffelo: Das gro&szlig;e Schattenspiel is a cooperative game for 2-4 players, ages 5 and up. The game box is turned into a small shadow theater, where silhouettes are shown in the theater before each turn. Each player is going to be the &quot;Shadow Master&quot;, who mustn't take part in the guessing then, however. The shadows have to be discovered (colored and lovingly illustrated) as quickly as possible on the board. Who discovered the correct one of the 48 different shades scenes will be rewarded with a nut and may continue to move the team to to the next space on the forest path field. If the guess was incorrect, it costs a nut-chip and the team stone also is not being moved.&#10;&#10;You can only win together when the team reaches the finish. In addition, the player with the most nut chips is then also the team winner. The team can just as well lose together, because we know that the Gruffalo is sometimes a pretty bad guy, which is not to be trusted so completely. Therefore, there are also shadows in the game for which there is - how mean! - no matching scene on the board. As it is, be extra careful then and be not deceived by the Gruffalo. If the Gruffalo card was four times in the game, unfortunately, the whole team has lost.&#10;&#10;",

The goal is to move through the castle, fighting monsters and overcoming various traps and other events, to gather 5 parts of Dracula's body. Bring them to the tower to resurrect Dracula and break the curse before time runs out, and then, hopefully, kill him again to win the game.&#10;&#10;13 playable characters to choose from, each with their own deck of unique weapons and skills which are gradually unlocked throughout the game, and plenty of monsters, events, and items, so that no two games are exactly the same.&#10;&#10;",

In this game, players are rival museum curators trying to arrange the most prestigious exhibitions of bizarre and unusual artifacts - unicorn hooves, kraken tentacles, books of pure evil, and alien skulls, to name a few.&#10;&#10;Over four rounds, two players will play a series of tricks, trying to win artifacts for their museums and score prestige. The twist is that the highest scoring cards are not always the cards most likely to win a trick. So huge bonus points are available if you can deduce what cards your opponent is able to play and which tricks they are able to win.&#10;&#10;With only 20 cards to keep track of, skills in deduction and risk management are paramount. Eccentric Exhibits is a tense, high-skill game for two players.&#10;&#10;",

So, why wait ages for the next holiday or moan about the rain? After all, there's this super sand game for at home! In Pass auf, kleine Krabbe you have to fill the sand moulds with sand and cleverly place the sand figures onto the game board. However, you have to think carefully about where you build: because the waves wash everything away that is too close to the water! The game ends as soon as all spaces have been covered by sand figures or waves. Now you have to count up, who has the most sand figures on the game board. The player with the most is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Buongiorno, Signorina is an Italian style reaction game for 2 to 6 players aged 8 years and up. Shuffle the cards and deal them face down to each player, so that each player has approximately the same number of cards. Don&rsquo;t look at your cards, but place them face down in a deck in front of you. Then you continue in a clockwise direction. When it&rsquo;s your turn, draw the top card from your deck. Reveal it by turning it away from you, so that you are not the first one to see it. That way, no one can accuse you of cheating! Place it in the middle of the table. Then each take it in turns to place your card on top of the card previously laid. Continue doing this until a card demands an action. Tip: the faster you turn over your cards, one after the other, the more fun it becomes.&#10;&#10;Which cards demand which actions?&#10;&#10;Pasta: &#10;As long as pasta appears, nothing happens. The sort makes no difference whatsoever. The neighbour on your left plays the next card.&#10;&#10;Re: As soon as one of the four Kings turns up, salute him very quickly. Move your flat hand to your forehead and touch it with your fingertips. It makes no difference whether you use your right or left hand.&#10;&#10;Signorina:&#10;As soon as one of the four Ladies appears, quickly call out &ldquo;Buongiorno, Signorina&rdquo; (pronounced Buonchorno Sinnjorina).&#10;&#10;Mandriano:&#10;As soon as one of the four Cowherds appears, quickly blow a kiss. To do this, simulate a kiss on your fingertips and symbolically blow it away.&#10;&#10;Cavallo:&#10;As soon as one of the four Horses turns up, like lightning, bang your flat hand down on the card(s) in the middle of the table.&#10;&#10;This is how the game ends:&#10;The game ends as soon as one of you has no more cards left. Have you laid your last card in the middle of the table? Then you&rsquo;ve almost won. But Attenzione: if instead of showing pasta, it demands an action, then you must carry this out quickly and correctly. Therefore, make an effort so that you don&rsquo;t have to take all the cards from the middle of the table. Did everything go well? Complimenti &ndash; you have won!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Operation Lam Son 719 was the first major offensive waged by the Army of the Republic of South Vietnam (ARVN) outside of its borders. Supported by US airpower, the offensive sought to destroy the Communist supply dumps along the Ho Chi Minh trail in Cambodia and Laos, as well as disrupt any offensive by the forces of the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) and its People&rsquo;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN), better known in the USA as the Vietcong. The offensive was also the first large scale test of President Nixon&rsquo;s policy of &ldquo;Vietnamization&rdquo; in which the bulk of the war effort was to be borne by the ARVN as the US forces were withdrawn home.&#10;&#10;The Communist high command was well aware an offensive was in the works, and planned a counter-offensive. What ensued was one of the largest battles of the war that resulted in a very costly and controversial outcome. Both sides claimed victory but in the end the overall course of the war was little changed and America&rsquo;s resolve to exit the conflict only deepened.&#10;&#10;Operation Lam Son is published by High Flying Dice Games. It is designed by Paul Rohrbaugh, with graphics by Bruce Yearian. Players use a standard deck of playing cards to activate units and resolve most combats.&#10;&#10;",

The remaining cards are shuffled and placed in the center of the table.  One card is flipped over next to the deck to start the discard pile.  Players can choose a card from the discard pile or the deck to add to their holder. They must exchange this new card with one in their holder. If the dogcatcher card is drawn the player must discard all of their cards and draw new ones. The first player to match all the dogs on their holder with drawn cards wins.&#10;&#10;",

While experimenting with early Portal technology and magic, they discovered a form of enchanted stone that would allow anything painted on it to become real.

The object is to have more of your color skystones on the grid than your opponent.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with 5 skystone cards dealt from a shuffled deck, and players take turns placing one of their cards with their color face up into any open space on the board. When a player places their skystone next to one or more of an opponent's skystones a battle takes place. If the attacking player wins, the defending player must flip their skystone so that it now shows the attacking player's color. Play continues until all 9 spaces are filled. The player with the most skystones of their color is the victor.&#10;&#10;",

Each player, in alternating rounds, can use different actions with his team in an agile manner, while deciding to focus on the technical, physical or psychological aspects of the sport. These choices allow the development of teams with very varied personalities.&#10;&#10;The board game will begin in a more basic form, with four national teams and rules to play endlessly unique matches. But, with the help of additional goals, we can unlock and release the game&rsquo;s full fledged potential by means of the campaign mode, in which the rules for managing the entire technical and administrative team, including trainings, casting athletes, managing the teams resources, fully customizable teams and even stadiums construction will be out allowing a hugely expanded strategical and tactical options in the best and definitive soccer game ever made!&#10;&#10;NOTE: WE ARE CURRENTLY UNDER A CROWDFUNDING CAMPAIGN ON: https://www.sibite.com.br/ViewCampaign.php?cid=63&#10;&#10;Check out the project in english and english subtitles as well!

        "description": "In a distant future, scientists were able to build small alternate Earths. Exactly 504 such Earths have thus far been built. The scientists programmed each of these Worlds with an individual set of laws and rules which the residents strictly follow and consider most important for their lives. These may be exploration, consumption, economics, military, etc., and each is unique. You can visit all of these 504 alternate Earths to experience how the people are living, and decide which of these worlds harbors the best civilization. On which World do you want to live? Explore them all and decide!&#10;&#10;504 is a game that creates 504 different games out of one box. The game consists of nine modules:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Module 1: Pick-Up &amp; Deliver&#10;    Module 2: Race&#10;    Module 3: Privileges&#10;    Module 4: Military&#10;    Module 5: Exploration&#10;    Module 6: Roads&#10;    Module 7: Majorities&#10;    Module 8: Production&#10;    Module 9: Shares&#10;&#10;&#10;In each single game, you take three different modules from the nine available and assemble them in any order you like to create a new game. (504 = 9 * 8 * 7 = the number of distinct permutations of three items from a set of nine. The order of the three game modules is significant, and modules cannot be repeated.) For example, you can play:&#10;&#10;&#10;    a racing game that expands through exploration with technology improving the racing or exploration (World &quot;253&quot;).&#10;    an 18XX-style stock game with network building for income and production sites to provide workers for the road building (World &quot;968&quot;).&#10;    a war game with a pick-up and deliver economy and bonus scoring from majorities (&quot;World 417&quot;).&#10;&#10;&#10;Each single game takes from 30 to 120 minutes to play.&#10;&#10;",

Each time a player touches a piece of evidence, they learn what it is, but unfortunately now that evidence points to their involvement in the crime!&#10;&#10;The games uses 17 cards, 16 of which are laid out in a 4x4 grid with the 17th card in the active player's hand. Each card has an arrow on the back of it, and during play these arrows point at the players.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you have the one extra card in hand and pick up any card from the board. You choose one of these cards and place it face-down in the empty space with the arrow pointing to you; to end your turn, pass the card still in hand to your left-hand opponent, who now takes their turn.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you can also make an accusation. To do this, name a weapon and a motive, then pick up two cards pointing to the same opponent and look at them. If these cards match what you said, reveal these cards to everyone because you've just won the game; if you're wrong, however, place these cards facedown once again, but now pointing at yourself.&#10;&#10;Each card also has a special reveal benefit. When you place a card facedown on the board pointing at yourself, normally only you know what that card is; if you reveal the card, everyone now knows what it is, but you get to do the reveal benefit on that card, e.g., looking at cards without pointing them at yourself or rotating cards to point at opponents.&#10;&#10;",

Each game round you use battle cards to compete for a reward card containing three different sexy challenges. The winner of the round then gets to select one of the sexy challenges for you both to act out. Once you have completed the challenge you move on to the next round and start playing for a new reward card. To make things interesting the rewards will become more and more naughty until the game ends with the final reward - which of course is the naughtiest of them all.&#10;&#10;",

The game presents the three main battles of the campaign &mdash; Fulford (20 September), Stamford Bridge (25 September), and Hastings (14 October) &mdash; using the Battles of the Medieval World system.&#10;&#10;Each battle has its own map, with hexes approximately 55 yards across. Units represent around 200 men and are typed as infantry, archers, and cavalry. Turns are 30 minutes of real time. Combat features a simple odds-based CRT with special rules covering archery and cavalry charges. Key leaders are present and affect unit morale and rally. Each of the games can be played in two hours or less. Players also may choose the campaign scenario, fighting all three battles in sequence, with the outcome of each affecting the forces available in the next.&#10;&#10;Published in S&amp;T 293, Jul/Aug 2015&#10;&#10;",

Each player takes on the role of a medieval knight in a modern junk yard. Players fling trash at each other, everything from broken microwave ovens to mutant albino alligators.&#10;&#10;Players set up their ramparts by placing &quot;Wall Cards&quot; on the table before them. A player starts the battle by attacking any opponent's walls. The attacked player then retaliates by attacking any player's walls. Trash War isn't played in standard turn order. Players attack and retaliate against opponents of their choice. In the end, the player with the last wall standing wins.&#10;&#10;",

        "name": "Arcasam: Beat The Dragon",
        "description": "Arcasam: Beat The Dragon is a strategy role-playing game for 2 - 5 players. In this game, where you can fight monsters as well as your opponents, and get a reward if you win the fight. At the end, when you are strong and equipped enough, you can dare to fight and beat the evil Dragon - which is menacing the world of Arcasam - before your opponents do. You will get better, stronger and more powerful each round, however your victory depends on the strategy you choose.&#10;&#10;Setup&#10;There are 7 big hexes in the game - 1 center hex, which is the Dragon's den and 6 other hexes creating the terrain. The shape of the game board varies according to the number of players - it is versatile. This will guarantee that the game board will be always adequate - not too big, not too small.&#10;&#10;Each hex contains 5 slots - you can place a castle, tavern, iron mine, tailor, tanner, orchard or monsters there. You can place them evenly or randomly. This factor contributes to the variability of the game as well.&#10;&#10;Apart from the game board, each player has his own player board in front of him. He can mark his place a weapon there, place his companion card as well as mark his current attack, defence and health points. The last component is a main board, where players count the rounds and phases of the game.&#10;&#10;Game Play Overview&#10;Each round,player has a fixed number of steps he can make (at the beginning it is 13) and during his turn, he can step on/pass through the following:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Empty spot: No action&#10;    Iron mine / Tailor / Tanner / Orchard: You will get the supply of iron / cloth / leather / food. Materials (iron, cloth and leather) are needed when you want to buy a weapon and upgrade your skill tree. Without weapon, you cannot fight the monsters and your opponents.&#10;    Monster: Once you step on this slot, you have to fight the particular monster. If  you win, you get a precious piece of gold along with the loot.&#10;    Castle: In the castle, you can buy weapons needed for the fights, or you can improve your skill tree.&#10;    Tavern: Each time you pass through the tavern, you have to draw 1 companion card, where you will find some kind of advantage. In the tavern, you can be also healed after the fight. (1 step = 1 life).&#10;&#10;&#10;If you encounter one of your opponents during your round and you both already have a weapon, you or him can choose to fight one another. The winner gets 8 materials from the backpack of the loser and the loser will have to get healed in the tavern.&#10;&#10;So, you can fight either the monster or one of your opponents. The system of the monster fight is different than the system of the fight with your opponent. Weapons have different costs, however you always need to pay one piece of gold which you can get only if you beat the monster.&#10;&#10;-Fight with your opponents&#10;&#10;When one hero encounters another one, and both of them have a weapon, each of them can choose to start a fight. For 1 food they can always draw 2 action cards (they can be either attack or defense) but the maximum they can have in hand is 10.&#10;&#10;Hero who chose to fight his opponent starts and plays an attack. The attacked has to have a defense card in order not to loose any lives. Then the other player (attacked) plays an attack and and the attacker has to play a defense. If one of the players does not have a defence card, he has to subtract certain number of lives, depending on the attack of the attacker and defense of the attacked. If one of the players has 0 lives, he lost the fight and has to give 8 materials from his backpack to his opponent. Then he has to get healed to the tavern.&#10;&#10;-Fight with the monsters&#10;&#10;Fight with the monster is much easier then the fight with other hero. Each monster has certain number of lives and strength of his attack, depending on the phase of the game. This is the only part of the game where player uses the dice. Depending on the number the player rolled on the dice and on the current phase of the game (1,2,3), monster attacks with a certain strength. The player has to play defence cards in order not to loose the fight. Then he has to play the attack cards to beat the monster, depending on number of lives the particular monster has, and on the weapon the hero has.  If the hero wins, he will take 1 gold and choose 1 loot, where he can find some kind of advantage.&#10;&#10;The fight with the Dragon is the same as a fight with other monsters, but he is very strong, so the player has to be very well equiped and experienced.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Welcome to Rogue Planet! A derelict world where you can experience true sci-fantasy gaming that allows you to fight skirmishes that focus on the cinematics and action of the genre without skimping on the tactics. It features:&#10;&#10;&#10;    ROGUE Die Mechanic&#10;    PAWN System&#10;    FX Phyisics Engine&#10;    Skill Based Combat&#10;    ENERGY Expenditure System&#10;    No labor intensive bookkeeping!&#10;    No measuring!&#10;    Custom point based force creation&#10;    Equipment and Upgrades&#10;    Sorcery and Psionics&#10;    Multiple game levels&#10;    Scenarios&#10;&#10;&#10;-Play Aids&#10;&#10;INNOVATIVE SYSTEMS&#10;ROGUE DIE&trade; | The ROGUE DIE mechanic allows you to counteract your enemies&rsquo; actions during their turns and fuels your powered weapon, powered armor, and psionic force weapon abilities and effects. Counter-actions include things like: dodging, returning ranged fire, counter casting, and intercept maneuvers.&#10;&#10;PAWN SYSTEM&trade; | The innovative PAWN system provides a unique mechanism for representing your leader&rsquo;s retinue and followers and makes for dynamically changing battles as your hero loses abilities, power, and support during a game. PAWNS are also a prime feature of the campaign system and allow a leader to gain new abilities, change strategies, and evolve as a adventure progresses.&#10;&#10;Pawns include: ammo grunts, bots, expendables, familiars, intimidators, and brutes [and many more!]. Who will follow you into battle?&#10;&#10;FX | The FX Physics Engine&trade; powers the epic throws, collisions, and staggering blows on ROGUE PLANET. It also gives players the option to make the battlefield more interactive with the implementation of destructible, throwable, and treacherous terrain types. Want to throw an orc in powered armor halfway across the battlefield into a group of goblins and see what survives? FX makes it happen!&#10;&#10;ENERGY | The ENERGY expenditure system allows you to simulate the strength of your force, powers the various armor ratings of your troops, and gives you the option to keep your units in play when you want or need to- but there&rsquo;s always a cost!&#10;&#10;STREAMLINED GAMEPLAY&#10;GOT SKILLS? | Actions on ROGUE PLANET are a measure of skill. You&rsquo;ll find no &lsquo;buckets-of-dice&rsquo; or straight-line probabilities here. The interactive skill check system means that all players are constantly involved in the game, and you&rsquo;ll need to work for the best possible tactical advantage or risk having your opponent counter you and take advantage of your failures.&#10;&#10;NO BOOKKEEPING! | There are no hit point boxes, extensive tables, or detailed stat tracking on ROGUE PLANET&trade;. Not only that, but there are no chits, tokens, spell, psionic, or effect markers littering the table either. The focus is always on the miniatures, terrain, and action on the table.&#10;&#10;MEASUREMENT? | There are no measuring sticks, grids, rulers, centimeters, or inches used for the game. Measurements are based on the relative position of units, line-of-sight [LOS], terrain, and the in-game FX Physics Engine&trade;.&#10;&#10;CREATE WHAT YOU WANT&#10;CUSTOM FORCE CREATION | Point based unit creation system gives you total control to bring your force to the tabletop in the way you envision it.&#10;&#10;EQUIPMENT AND UPGRADES | There are over 30 different types of base weapons, armor ratings, and enhancements in the game that be used by themselves to equip your troops or combined with one another to create almost limitless supply of custom combi-weapons. These upgrades include: axes, blades, lances, blasters, heavy launchers, powered armor, powered fists, gravity hammers, chained blades, psionic force weapons, and grenades.&#10;&#10;SORCERERS AND PSYCHERS | What sci-fantasy world would be complete without the inclusion of sorcerers and psychers. Heroes on ROGUE PLANET can be either [or both!] and wield powers like: psionic throw, anchor, time stop, magic missile, blink, deflection, and more. May the psionic force be with you space wizard- always.&#10;&#10;PLAY HOW YOU WANT&#10;GAME TYPES | There are multiple levels of play that allow players with various collection sizes and gameplay preferences to enjoy the game and have it grow with them. Patrols, Strikes, Missions, and Extended Ops ensure that there&rsquo;s always a new way to experience adventures and combat on this derelict world.

        "description": "VERBA is the new language learning card game developed by The Pericles Group. The concept is incredibly simple -- one player (acting as a judge) draws a random card containing a fill in the blank sentence in the target language and the other players play a card containing a noun from their hand. The player who has played the sentence card then chooses the best card played and that player scores a point. Play continues with that player as the new judge.&#10;&#10;All VERBA players benefit from seeing high frequency words, with many repetitions, in a context that fosters authentic learning and comprehensible input. As with all of The Pericles Group's educational games, the play objectives and the learning objectives are one in the same. Players win by making comprehensible sentences, scaffolded by the cards, the images, and the helpful hints included on the sentence cards. We always want to ensure that the learners are seeing correct forms and those forms are continually reinforced by the mechanics.&#10;&#10;",

Each mission, taking from 30 to 90 minutes, requires an adequate choice of gear and tactics. The players can also lay deadly traps and prepare ambushes. A day and night system is used in the game which has a significant impact on the choice of equipment and enemies' action abilities.&#10;&#10;At the end of each mission players gain experience points, allowing them to reach new levels of training and be better prepared for survival in the hostile world. The most precious prize, though, is the remains of the defeated machines used to construct the hunters' gear.&#10;&#10;All the missions combine into an outstanding campaign during which the players will have to make tough choices influencing their future fate. Each time they will be able to make different decisions, allowing every mission to be an exceptional experience full of new emotions.&#10;&#10;",

The trick is to select items that will get you a better take and help you build the best costumes. Players also score for having the most costume items in each genre.&#10;&#10;Cosplay Grab is a quick-playing game with fun elements but a eurogame soul, borrowing the central mechanism from Zomboozle, another game from 3SidedCard.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "From the publisher's website:&#10;&#10;&quot;Setting Sun, Rising Sun: The Russo-Japanese War&quot; is an uncomplicated wargame centered on the naval aspects of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905. The game depicts this conflict at a strategic level, with most operational and tactical details represented by fast and easy-to-play systems, rather than intricate mechanics. The intent of the game is to provide a broad overview of the historical events while being fun to play. The object of the game for the Japanese player is to control the sea areas around Japan to prevent Russian combatants from bombarding and cutting off supplies to the island nation, and to destroy the naval forces of Russia. The object of the game for the Russian player is to disrupt Japanese sea control, retain sea control around the Russian and Manchurian coastline for as long as possible, and destroy Japanese naval forces. Both players must obtain their objectives by deploying their naval resources into the sea areas on the map, earning victory points at the end of each of six turns for areas under their control, and for opposing units destroyed.&#10;&#10;Setting Sun, Rising Sun owes its original inspiration to War at Sea, designed by Jon Edwards and Don Greenwood and published by The Avalon Hill Game Company, a game which covered the war in the Atlantic in World War Two. Setting Sun, Rising Sun borrows a number of concepts from this earlier game as a starting point, such as area movement, individual capital ships, battle line resolutions, and rolling sixes to hit, and then diverges significantly to reflect the Russo-Japanese War situation. The game includes about 280 counters, a 22&quot;x28&quot; map sheet of the combat areas including charts and tables, and a set of rules to play the game.&#10;&#10;",

The tsunami that followed caused thousands to lose their lives, including the government and most of the military. In the aftermath of the earthquake, the island is in a major state of emergency with no one to lead the people. The world is looking for someone to whom they can to send desperately needed resources. With such an opportunity, many have risen up to claim power. Will you rise to the challenge?&#10;&#10;Aftermath: The Beginning is a game about gaining political influence by providing desperate provinces the resources they need. Players use their influence to acquire resources, use publicity to bolster their campaign or hinder their opponents, and make deals with each other to reach the final goal of becoming the next leader of the country.&#10;&#10;Players customize the island at the beginning of each game, giving each game variance and loads of replay value. The objective of the game is to acquire the most population control through your influence. Every turn, an aid package - full of valuable resources - is sent to the island. Players bid for resources and spend them to gain influence in the different provinces. Each turn, each province has different resource needs. Each province has a population value. As players gain influence, they gain control of those provinces. The player at the end of the game with the most population control wins.&#10;&#10;",

The Answer cards are dealt to all players equally and the questions are spread out on the table.&#10;&#10;One player begins by selecting another player and draws a Question card from the pile and ask the question. The player selected then takes the top most answer card and read this.&#10;Now (s)he pics a player, draws a card and reads the question&#10;&#10;The game continues until there are no more Questions and Answer cards.&#10;The one who first get rid of Answer Cards is the winner; if the game ends because the Question cards run out, the one with least Answer cards is the winner.&#10;&#10;Possibly illustrated by Hans Quist (1922-1983).&#10;&#10;",

During 5 turns, you will try to reach as many stopover towns as possible using the different vehicles available.&#10;&#10;Each player has 5 cards in hand that show a vehicle and a route section with a number of steps. Each one of the players gets the 5 vehicles. A hierarchy, which will evolve during the game, indicates which vehicle is the fastest for the turn.&#10;&#10;To begin, the players choose simultaneously a &ldquo;Vehicle&rdquo; card from their hand and reveal it. The player who has selected the fastest vehicle chooses first the route card that comprises the most steps, among the available ones. The other players take turn doing the same. The last player to choose his route section will be able to use his booster, which is a power specific to the pilot he controls, as a support for the following turn.&#10;&#10;The played &ldquo;Vehicle&rdquo; cards become available &ldquo;Route&rdquo; cards for the following turn, which can now begin. You will have to plan in which order you will play your vehicles, according to your booster and the route sections at stake.&#10;&#10;After the 5th turn, the player whose route crosses most steps wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Nocturn is a game that combines two genres &mdash; strategy and horror. It takes place in the underworld where players take control over one of the nations struggling to survive among the dead realm. Players establish Houses and grant them lands, obtaining more Lords for their wars and intrigues. Through these Houses they also call armies or build mighty cities and strongholds for their nations. Their goals are simple: expanding borders and finally subjugating each other. During the gameplay the fifth player will lead diffrent force. Death, the original sovereign of the realm. In an attempt to recapture his lands, now lost to the living, he will pose a major threat to all the other players.&#10;&#10;Easy to play/Difficult to master&#10;&#10;The game can be played using Short Campaign rules (for 3 players, game time ~150 min) or Long Campaign rules (for 4-5 players, game time ~180-240 min). The basics of Nocturn are simple to learn and a game can start even with only one person fmailiar with rulebook and other players having only general idea about it. Gameplay favors not the players who blindly memorize all the rules but rather those who can scheme and think outside the box.&#10;&#10;The possibilities on how to play Nocturn are only up to player imagination. &#10;As a player you can shut your nation inside a massive well defended valley surrounded by the mountains, waiting for an outside world to degrade into chaos. You can play as an agressor, focusing on conquering other players cities and strongholds while building few yourself. Or if you want to scheme in darkness, submit early in the game to the neigbour and deceive stronger players while engaging in secret actions destabilizing the world everywhere but in your lands. Still, you have to remember the World is constantly evolving around you with each passing turn. It may happen that your well devised plan will crumble - your Court taken by other stronger player, forcing you to wonder around with few loyal troops left, selling your services to whoever would give you a glimpse of hope.&#10;&#10;Nocturn is played for 10 turns. Each consists of three Phases:&#10;&#10;1) Darkness Phase         &#10;During this phase Rulers ressurect their dead Lords.&#10;&ndash; Death plays Darkness Cards and Omen Cards (Long Campaign).&#10;&#10;2) Action Phase     &#10;During this phase players, one after another, execute actions using their Action Tokens.&#10;Available actions for them are: &#10;-Moving Lords of the chosen House, &#10;-Building up to 2 new Fiefdoms, &#10;-Developing existining Fiefdom, &#10;-Collecting Tributes form Houses, &#10;-Calling Lords to arms, &#10;-Buying new Technologies.&#10;&#10;3) Siege Phase&#10;During this phase, players may assault besieged enemy strongholds or relieve allied ones.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Designer Uwe Rosenberg has a talent for dreaming up new and inventive card games, and Mamma Mia! is a perfect example of this talent, with players placing pizza ingredients into a combined pool, then trying to time their pizza baking in order to make use of what's available in the kitchen.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with eight different pizza orders to fill, with one of those order cards in hand; each player also starts with a hand of ingredient cards (showing pepperoni, mushroom, pineapple, green pepper or olive). On a turn, a player lays down one or more ingredient cards of a single type into a common stack, then optionally adds a pizza order card to that stack. He then refills his hand by drawing as many cards as he played from either the shared ingredient deck or his own order deck.&#10;&#10;After the draw pile is exhausted, the shared pile of cards is flipped over and sorted by ingredients until an order comes up. If enough ingredient cards are available to fill that order, the owner scores it; if not, the player can make up the difference by playing cards from his hand (and thereby scoring the order) or else return the card to the bottom of his order deck.&#10;&#10;Once all the orders are scored or returned, shuffle the ingredients used in pizzas and start another round of play. After three complete rounds, the player who's filled the most orders wins!&#10;&#10;It includes a promotional expansion consisting of 10 double ingredient cards, two in each of the five ingredients.&#10;&#10;During game set-up, the double ingredient cards are substituted into the deck in place of two ingredients of each type. For game play, a double ingredient is handled exactly the same as the single ingredients, but of course count as two ingredients of that kind.&#10;&#10;If an ingredient is needed to complete an order, double ingredients on display must be used first. If necessary, a player must overpay, which also applies to double ingredients played from the hand to complete an order.&#10;&#10;",

Players can also use this mini-game to learn about the basic rules and gameplay of the original Magic Realm.&#10;&#10;The gameplay closely follows the original Magic Realm, with Birdsong (Planning), Daylight (Action), Evening (Combat) and Midnight (Reset) phases. Monster spawning and Movement is simplified to cater for the self-drawn map. Combat closely follows the original Magic Realm rules when playing solo. Hiring followers and using magic is also covered.&#10;&#10;&quot;Light 30&quot; (or L30) is a Magic Realm game term, meaning &quot;something Light-weight that takes up 30 units of time&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

These increase the ability to have more players and include all of these great additional cards to the game with hilarious references and images by Randy Martinez.&#10;&#10;Sitting Ducks Gallery is a hysterically fun, stick-it-to-your-neighbor, line manipulation game invented by Keith Meyers. Sitting Ducks is reminiscent of the classic carnival-style, midway shooting galleries, where players are trying to take out as many ducks as possible. Players move ducks and targets, take aim, and eventually eliminate other players&rsquo; ducks using a variety of humorous Action Cards, while trying to keep their own safe.  The goal is to be the last duck in the pond!&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY&#10;&#10;In Sitting Ducks, each player gets their own group of ducks. Those ducks are shuffled together and form the Duck Deck, which then become the Duck line.&#10;&#10;The Duck line is always in flux - when a Duck is removed; the other ducks move forward to fill the gap.  Certain cards can move the line forward, backwards or rearrange ducks in the line in your favor or your opponents. With the right cards, players may also move and manipulate targets to try to keep their own Ducks safe.&#10;&#10;Eventually, you&rsquo;ll get caught snoozing and you will surely lose some of your ducks.&#10;&#10;Lose all of your ducks, and you can no longer win the game.  But, one of the most fun aspects of Sitting Ducks is when all of your ducks have been eliminated from the game. Although you won&rsquo;t win, you&rsquo;ll still get a chance to exact revenge on the opponents who took you out and play Action Cards for the rest of the game! The last player to have a duck in the water is the winner!&#10;&#10;",

Each player must then place one chip of the same denomination on each of the ten spaces on the Bonanza wheel. Deal the cards one at a time beginning at the dealer's left and dealing one extra hand as a &quot;widow.&quot; Continue dealing until the pack is exhausted, regardless of the fact that some of the players will receive an extra card.&#10;&#10;The players examine their cards. The dealer, without looking at the &quot;widow,&quot; chooses either to discard his hand in exchange for it or to keep his hand and sell the &quot;widow&quot; to the highest bidder. If he announces that the &quot;widow&quot; is for sale, the other players, without looking at it, may bid for it if they choose, the bidding starting at the dealer's left and continuing around the table as many times as necessary to determine the highest bidder. The successful bidder gives the dealer the number of chips bid, discards his original hand, and picks up the &quot;widow.&quot; If the dealer offers the &quot;widow&quot; for sale and no one bids, it is discarded.&#10;&#10;The play of the hand falls into two parts, the first on the upper half of the wheei (Joker, Queen-Jack, Sequence, Ten-Two, and Poker) and the second on the lower half (Ace of Spades, King of Hearts, Queen of Diamonds, Jack of Clubs, and Center Section).&#10;&#10;VALUE OF POKER HANDS&#10;&#10;Poker hands are ranked as such:&#10;&#10;1.

As you travel though a deck of adventure cards rife with dangers, you battle zombie hordes, drive abandoned school buses, scavenge for gas and bullets, and explore a darkened, tainted American countryside full of shambling undead, haunted carnivals, and plumes of toxic gas. Your goal is to stay alive until you reach the safe, sandy beaches of the California coast.&#10;&#10;Three different stages of adventure cards create an experience of increasing difficulty and ensure that each playthrough is unique. Each round begins with an auction that determines both player order and which cards you will encounter. Since the resources used for bidding are the same as those used to battle the oncoming zombie hordes, your survival depends as much on your resource management as it does upon winning those bidding wars. The player who either accumulates the most points or survives the longest wins.&#10;&#10;Zombies of all types await, with cannibals, anti-personnel mines and radioactive wastes also being among the hazards awaiting the players. Who will survive the zombie onslaught?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

When opponents land on players owned property, the owning player collects rent from the landing player. Owning sets of properties increases the rent paid to the player who owns them, by the player who lands on the square. The ultimate goal is to have the most money and drive opponents into bankruptcy.&#10;&#10;The classic Monopoly with constructions and other elements from FC Barcelona, a famous Soccer Club in Spain&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Elemental is a strategic board game of simultaneous action and hidden information. Players assume control of either the light mage or the dark mage and control 7 elementals in a duel. The elementals--water, fire, earth, wind, frost, bolt, and light/dark--interact in a 5-way rock-paper-scissors system. Each of them is equally strong, given the right circumstances. The goal of the game is simple: either defeat or isolate your opponent's light/dark elemental.&#10;&#10;The trick is that you can only find out your opponent's pieces by battle or deduction. Each player will be trying to gather information while cutting losses and revealing as little as possible. Elementals can sustain 2 hits, allowing players to take calculated risks and control an area with a bluffed piece.&#10;&#10;The arena itself plays into the deduction process with its fountains (which provide tantalizing bonuses for matching elementals) and its energy wells (which generate crystals for special one-time maneuvers). Once the player has deduced their opponent&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses, they can take command of the arena and lead their elementals to victory.&#10;&#10;The Print and Play is available here: Elemental Print and Play&#10;Note that the print and play is meant to convert an old set of checkers and 2 D6. As such, the lightning elemental is not included in this version, as that would require 4 more pieces than the standard checkers set.&#10;&#10;",

At the beginning of each round, if a player controls provinces in at least four regions, they reveal the next card in their stack and select one of the bonuses depicted on it. These bonuses include war chests, armies placed directly into the tower tray, rice and victory points.&#10;&#10;With Military Leaders, every player is given one military leader figure to place on one of their controlled provinces. A player's leader provides extra benefits for performing actions in their province, such as reducing the cost for buildings or providing extra resources when collecting rice or taxes. At the end of a player's turn, they move their leader to an adjacent province they control and leave a marker at the old location - if they don't control any provinces adjacent to where their leader is, they move their leader to any of their controlled provinces without leaving a marker behind. The more markers a player has on the board at the end of the game, the more points will be awarded!&#10;&#10;For Chambers, many offices have to be taken in order to rule the land. At the beginning of each round, six chamber markers are revealed and placed on the corresponding spaces on the chamber tableau, representing available offices that can be filled by the players. Whoever controls the most provinces in each region can fill the position by exchanging the chamber marker on the tableau with one of their own player markers. At the end of the game, players are awarded extra points for majorities in horizontal and vertical lines on the chamber tableau.&#10;&#10;",

Sailing around a series of islands on a cloth map, players encounter ports, other players, and X's where Treasure may be buried.&#10;&#10;There are a variety of Treasures to possess and Infamy tokens to be gained by fighting pirates and ports or completing various Quests.&#10;&#10;The game plays in rounds, with each player receiving up to 8 random Action cards. They may Sail, Pillage, Board other ships, Shoot other ships, and/or Dig or Bury Treasure. Using their Action cards they may do as many of these actions as desired during their turn if they have the necessary cards. But players don't draw new cards until the end of the round. Bidding at the end of each round allows players to compete for who goes first, and which direction play moves.&#10;&#10;When 2 pirates are dead (the first player to die remains in the game as the ghost pirate), all the Treasure cards have been pillaged, OR any Quests are complete, the game ends. The player with the most Infamy points (Tokens and Treasure) wins!&#10;&#10;",

Players are dealt three cards each, and three more cards are placed face-down on the table. Starting with the player who's most recently had Chikuwa, each player may swap two cards from their hand with those on the table, or they may pass. Going clockwise, once each player has had their turn, the cards on the table are shuffled back into the deck, and another three are dealt face-down. Going back the other way, the players repeat their turn to swap one or two cards in their hand. Lastly, everyone shows their hand.&#10;&#10;The aim is to get the best ranking combination of three cards. In the game, 3-3-3 is the worst of all, since you have been a greedy cat and stuffed yourself until you've got stomach-ache. 0-0-0 is the best combination, since the owners see you've been so unselfish and punish the other cats by giving you their food. But after 0-0-0, the best combo is 3-3-2, then 3-2-2, then 3-3-1 and so on, down to 1-0-0 which beats 3-3-3. So, by bluffing and guessing, can you work up to a high ranking hand, or do you risk holding 0s in the aim of winning all?&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary:&#10;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#228;&#187;&#178;&#232;&#137;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#233;&#129;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#187;&#138;&#230;&#151;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#229;&#165;&#189;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#148;&#233;&#163;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#137;&#178;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#164;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#165;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#233;&#163;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#185;&#233;&#129;&#142;&#227;&#129;&#142;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#228;&#187;&#178;&#232;&#137;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#233;&#163;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#229;&#164;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#179;&#230;&#150;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#231;&#176;&#161;&#229;&#141;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#232;&#168;&#136;&#229;&#155;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#229;&#164;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#188;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#239;&#188;&#146;&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#186;&#164;&#230;&#143;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#190;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#131;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#228;&#187;&#138;&#229;&#186;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#229;&#190;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#229;&#141;&#138;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#232;&#168;&#136;&#229;&#145;&#168;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#144;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#152;&#228;&#186;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#132;3&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#232;&#168;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#231;&#149;&#170;&#233;&#171;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#239;&#188;&#145;&#231;&#149;&#170;&#229;&#188;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#233;&#163;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#185;&#233;&#129;&#142;&#227;&#129;&#142;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#239;&#188;&#145;&#231;&#149;&#170;&#229;&#188;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#239;&#188;&#145;&#231;&#149;&#170;&#228;&#189;&#142;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#228;&#187;&#178;&#232;&#137;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#233;&#163;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#228;&#186;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#239;&#188;&#145;&#231;&#149;&#170;&#229;&#188;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "This is it &ndash; you've finally been called up to the big leagues. There's one open position in the homicide unit and the competition for the job is fierce. The police chief is going to give all of you, the aspiring beat cops, a couple of murder investigations to see who has what it takes to become a real detective.&#10;&#10;Spoiler alert: All of you absolutely do not have what it takes.&#10;&#10;But that doesn't mean you aren't going to give it your best. You've watched, like, a whole marathon of police TV shows last weekend and you think you've got the formula for justice all figured out. And if there's one thing you've learned about the criminal justice system, it's this: It doesn't matter if you're right or wrong, it just matters how good you can look in front of your boss.&#10;&#10;Bad Detectives is a tile-based card game for 3-4 players, which takes approximately 45-60 minutes to play. Players take turns adding information to a network of Polaroid photos and strings, creating a map of the murder investigation. The players will use these strings to connect a Suspect, Weapon, and Crime Scene to the Victim. Once completed, the case is ready to go to trial.&#10;&#10;However, solving the murder investigation is simply a means to an end. The true objective of the game is to be the detective with the most Evidence Points when the central case goes to trial. When a player adds a new card to the investigation, Evidence Points are put into play on the card as it is placed. However, these are only counted towards a player's final score if those cards are used to directly link the Victim to the most relevant Leads. To succeed, players will need to undermine the credibility of their colleagues, take creative shortcuts to justice, and put their contributions to the case in the places that matter most.&#10;&#10;",

Production Points are required to Refit spent units, build new units, construct trenches, conduct research, etc. The combat system is very simple, but yields tremendous excitement and that &ldquo;just one more attack should do it&rdquo; feeling. Event cards allow for all sorts of historical situations, conditions, leaders, political events and so on. Everything that would be important in a WWI simulation is considered in this game.&#10;&#10;",

Native American units are activated as the player approaches them. The game system controls their movement and combat. Each unit has a combat strength (CEF value), firing range, and movement ability.&#10;&#10;The player wins if he or she can control a tribal hex for a full turn. The player loses if more than 20 CEF points in the game.&#10;&#10;The game includes several alternative history scenarios that explore the possibility of the day's events going differently. For example, in one scenario, Benteen's Battalion arrives earlier to aid 7th Cavalry. In another, the player has access to a Gatling Gun that never made it to the actual battle.&#10;&#10;The game is available in boxed, folio, or PNP formats.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Two wargames in one box.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;The Second Boer War 1899-1902 (a strategic wargame).&#10;&#10;Game description&#10;The game presents the struggles that took place during the Second Boer War between 1899 - 1902. The game consists of four phases, each of which is divided into 22 rounds. During rounds, players perform certain actions. The first and second phase of the game reflect the regular phase of the war. The third and fourth phases  are constructed differently, because they represent a specific phase of guerrilla warfare.&#10;&#10;The game uses the point to point system, six-sided dice and a deck of battle cards. The game map represents Cape Colony, Natal, Orange Free State and Republic of Transval. Each game phase corresponds to 3-9 months of real time. Military units (infantry, cavalry, artillery, tribals, machine guns, trains) are represented by abstract battle cards.&#10;During the game the players will carry out a series of operations (move, fight, events, special actions) using random actions (1 to 3 on the turn of the game).&#10;The introduced game events directly relate to historical events, directing the moves of players during the game.&#10;&#10;Battle cards are used to resolve combat in situations when contact between commanders of military formations is established. In &quot;The Second Boer War 1899 - 1902&quot; the military units involved in the combat are presented on cards. Depending on the phase of the game or the commander involved the combat may be a battle or a skirmish.&#10;During the battle, players use six cards, although this number may be increased with the rules on the Boer trenches or British garrisons. Individual characteristics of commanders are also important.&#10;The British player can choose the cards that he intends to use in battle, but the Boer player draws them randomly &ndash; this describes the voluntary nature of the Boer army.&#10;The battlefield is divided into three sections - the right wing, the left wing and the center.&#10;The Defender begins the battle and places one card on each section. Then the attacker puts two cards for each section and performs troop morale checks. If the check fails, the card does not participate in the battle.&#10;Defender reveals the cards and adds one to each section, testing their morale. If players have a surplus of cards, they can use them on the sections of the battlefield, where there are less than two cards.&#10;Players compare their strength for each section. The player who achieved 2 or 3 successes, wins the battle. The opponent suffers losses - British cards goes into the reinforcements pool, and the Boer commandos cards are eliminated.&#10;&#10;A skirmish is a smaller combat &ndash; the card limit is 3, but can be increased by the individual characteristics of the commander, the Boer fortifications or British garrisons. The British player can choose the cards he will use in a skirmish. The Boer player can choose one card, but he must randomly draw the other.&#10;The Defender places one card on each section of the battlefield. Then the Attacker does the same thing. For each card, he performs morale checks &ndash; a negative result means that the unit is not taking part in the skirmish, and can be replaced with a card from the surplus, if the player has it.&#10;Both players add the &ldquo;Strength&rdquo; value of their cards. The winner of the skirmish is the player, who achieved a higher score. If the loser is the Defender, he must vacate the occupied area.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Bloody veld: Battle of Magersfontein, 11 December, 1899 (a tactical wargame).&#10;&#10;Game scale:&#10;1 hex = 500 yd (457 m)&#10;1 game turn = 45 minutes&#10;1 counter = British infantry half battalion or part of Boer commando/cavalry regiment/artillery battery (Boer army: 1 gun).&#10;&#10;Game description&#10;The game uses the standard hex-and-counter system, and ten-sided dice. Each hex represents 500 yards or 457 metres, each game turn corresponds to 45 minutes of real time.&#10;British infantry is represented by half battalions, cavalry by regiments, artillery by batteries. One counters represents a part of a commando or one gun.&#10;&#10;Each game turn is divided into phases:&#10;1) Command phase &ndash; players use their Commanders-in-Chief and dispatch riders to give orders to subordinate commanders,&#10;2) Activation phase &ndash; after determining the initiative, players, using the Activation Markers, choose the brigade to activate. Activated units, move, fire, commence melee combat (only British units) and reorganize units and recover morale. The opponent can react by firing or counterattacking (only British units),&#10;3) Reorganization phase &ndash; players reorganize broken units.&#10;The principle of the game is based on an order system, which is associated with an action vector. The player must carry out the assigned order (of course, he gives them to himself), until the order is changed by the Commander-in-Chief, or the brigade commander manages to change it by himself. The order must be associated with a target hex (i.e attack hex, defend hex). The possible orders are: ATTACK or DEFEND.&#10;&#10;The game tries to present the diversity of combatants tactics mainly through unit formations. &#10;British units may perform weapon attacks and melee attacks. Boer units can only fire, but they start the game masked, moreover, some of them can benefit from the trenches. It makes it difficult for the British player who cannot shoot at masked units from a larger distance. The fieldworks allow the Boers to minimize their losses.&#10;&#10;The game treats the concept of zone of control differently from other games &ndash; it gives up the obligation to stop moving the unit in the enemy ZOC. The ZOC is a phenomenon that allows to fire or initiate close combat, and it is dependent on the units formation and the range of its firearms.&#10;Unit movement doesn&rsquo;t differ from other hex-and-counter systems.&#10;&#10;Fire combat takes into account the distance to the target, the firing unit morale and terrain on which the target is currently placed. Artillery performs its fire in the same way, using another fire combat chart. Distinct units are the Boer Pom-Pom automatic guns. These cannons move like artillery, but actually perform their fire according to the infantry fire chart. Each shot, however, means performing two checks and summing the results of fire. The result of fire combat can be the loss of morale, combat efficiency level or routing. Additionally also withdrawal.&#10;&#10;Melee combat is also based on the unit&rsquo;s morale, strength, formation, also the terrain. The effects of melee combat are almost the same as the effects of fire combat. The exception being the possibility of forcing the enemy to flee. Cavalry combat also includes the unit&rsquo;s momentum. Cavalry may react by counter-charging.&#10;The loss of unit&rsquo;s morale endurance during the game is marked with special markers.&#10;&#10;",

One player is selected to be the &ldquo;historian&rdquo; for the round and plays a History Card from the deck. Each player finishes the quote by passing one Quote Card face down to the historian. The historian for each round does not play a card. The historian shuffles the answers, reads them out loud in context with the History Card, and picks their favorite combination (usually the one that got the most laughs). Whoever played the chosen Quote Card gets to keep the History Card as a point.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each round select a new &ldquo;historian&rdquo; by moving clockwise around the room. Also, every player should draw a new card to bring their card total back to eight cards. The game is played until a pre-determined amount of points are earned by a single player (typically five).&#10;&#10;",

A unique flagship is chosen to lead each armada, providing it with special Directives to enhance the abilities of nearby ships.&#10;&#10;A game of Clockwork Armada plays out in a continual rotation of alternating activations. Ships will board, ram, and fire at each other, using stat cards to keep track of the damage done to the different areas of a ship. A set of segmented Course Rulers is used to determine the maneuverability of lumbering capital ships and nimble corvettes.&#10;&#10;A shared mission and individual objectives give each player multiple means of scoring enough victory points to win the game.&#10;&#10;",

The classic Zombicide rules have been revamped for this new incarnation of the game, while still retaining the nonstop action, tense atmosphere and easy-to-learn rules that made Zombicide a classic. Equip your survivor with equipment like chainmail armor or shields to defend against the undead, pick up spell books to perform fantastic enchantments, or light up a pool of dragon bile to create an all-consuming inferno of dragon fire!&#10;&#10;Take on the zombie invasion from the medieval streets to secret vaults that create quick passages through the citadel (and often hold special artifacts). Chase down the elusive Necromancers to keep them from multiplying the zombie masses. And tackle a whole new set of missions through which your group of survivors will become the heroes of the land (or the last victims of the zombie massacre).&#10;&#10;",

Players try to move through a labyrinthine game board in order to reach a desired symbol shown on a game board tile that matches a hidden card held by this player. The game board consists of a number of fixed tiles as well as rows and columns in which tiles can slide back and forth; these tiles show tunnels &ndash; T-shaped, straight, and otherwise &ndash; and a player can move his token only along the path as it exists on his turn.&#10;&#10;At the start of his turn, however, he takes the one tile on the side of the game board and pushes it into a row or column of his choice, shifting the tunnels and pushing out one tile that the next player will use. This player now moves his pawn, and if he reaches the desired symbol, he reveals the card, then looks at the next card in his stack to see what he wants to reach next turn. Once a player has revealed all of his cards, he needs to return to his starting corner. The first player to do this wins!&#10;&#10;To this basic game, Ocean Labyrinth adds an underwater theme and a twist: some tiles have special rules on their backsides. When a tile of this  type is pushed out, a special rule is used for the next turn:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Pufferfish: the current player is so scared from this fish that they lose their movement for the current turn.&#10;    Diving scooter: you move more quickly: take an additional turn&#10;    Oxygen tank: you don't have enough oxygen, so you must return your pawn to a freely chosen start tile.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Gameplay takes place on two copies of the same game board that are separated by the game box so that they are not visible to one another. The Poseidon player throws powerful storms against the Navigators, driving them off-course and confounding them so that they cannot reach the Sacred Island in time. Only Poseidon knows the real position of the ships as indicated on his copy of the game board.&#10;&#10;The navigators must sail through endless storms, blind to all around them, trying to gather clues to their whereabouts to stay on course. They also track the position of their ships on the game board, but the positions indicated are only a best guess &mdash; and they can become increasingly inaccurate as the game progresses.&#10;&#10;The navigators must use their wits to stay on course and reach the Sacred Island before the end of the game, while Poseidon wins by preventing them from reaching their destination.&#10;&#10;",
