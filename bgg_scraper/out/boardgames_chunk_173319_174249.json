        "description": "In CQ:Heroes, up to 4 players take turns collecting heroes and sending them out to gain victory points for your tavern.  From the mighty Paladins and Wardens of the King's Guard from Game Pack #1 to the powerful Great Wolves and Berserkers from Game Pack #2, Savage Beasts, each player will try to create a powerful combo of heroes to defeat even the toughest locations.&#10;&#10;The heroes from Game Pack #2 - Savage Beasts feature Pet heroes that can be controlled by the Beastmaster skill.&#10;&#10;Game Pack #2 - Savage Beasts includes the Adventure Deck: Desert Temple which features all new cards including a new card type: Raid Boss.  These encounters are much tougher than normal encounters and are placed in the location area when revealed.&#10;The new objective in Desert Temple is to defeat 3 of these Raid Bosses to open up the Throne Room.  This triggers the final battle where all players make last party of heroes to battle each other for the room's treasures.&#10;&#10;GAME FEATURES:&#10;&#10;Simple and engaging: Although it's simple to learn and play, turns can become quite involved with all of the hero abilities and how you combo them during your turn.&#10;&#10;Everyone plays to the end: No one is eliminated during the game and all players count their victory points at the end.&#10;&#10;Quick flow of play: Because you draw up your hand at the end of your turn, you are then able to plan your next turn while others are taking theirs.&#10;&#10;Accessible: Only 1 deck is needed for up to 4 players.  Extra decks can be used separately by each player or shuffled together for everyone to share.&#10;&#10;Easy to collect: No mystery packs.  Each deck has all the cards you need to play.&#10;&#10;Fast: The game sets up in less than a minute and plays in about 10-20 minutes.&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY:&#10;&#10;Starting with the first player, each player performs the following 4 actions in order:&#10;&#10;ATTACK: Attack 1 encounter OR skip your attack to add one additional Hero to your Tavern on the next step&#10;TAVERN: Place 1 hero in your Tavern (2 if you skipped your attack)&#10;DRAW: Draw your hand back up to 5 cards&#10;REFRESH: Draw and add 1 new Adventure card to the dungeon hall&#10;&#10;",

Compete with your opponent for supremacy on the battlefield in a mental tug of war. You take one piece from him, he places another. He takes one from you, you place another.

The sooner that a dragon captures an adventurer, the fewer points it's worth at the end of the round &mdash; and should an adventurer actually manage to escape, many points in treasure await.&#10;&#10;In Drachenhort, players don't represent these adventurers themselves, but rather secretly back a trio of these adventurers. Each turn, the active player rolls a die and moves one of the adventurers further away from the dragon. After all of the adventurers have moved once, all of them are available for movement once again. Don't be too obvious about which adventurers you support, though, for others will drop traps in their path or otherwise hobble them to ensure that they become dragon food first.&#10;&#10;At the end of a round, players score points based on how far their adventurers traveled, and after two rounds the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

A player can take a card only if it's not covered by any others, so timing comes into play as well as bonus moves that allow you to take a second card immediately. As in the original game, each card that you acquire can be built, discarded for coins, or used to construct a wonder.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with four wonder cards, and the construction of a wonder provides its owner with a special ability. Only seven wonders can be built, though, so one player will end up short.&#10;&#10;Players can purchase resources at any time from the bank, or they can gain cards during the game that provide them with resources for future building; as you acquire resources, the cost for those particular resources increases for your opponent, representing your dominance in this area.&#10;&#10;A player can win 7 Wonders Duel in one of three ways: each time you acquire a military card, you advance the military marker toward your opponent's capital, giving you a bonus at certain positions; if you reach the opponent's capital, you win the game immediately; similarly, if you acquire any six of seven different scientific symbols, you achieve scientific dominance and win immediately; if none of these situations occurs, then the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

It&rsquo;s free for songbirds to sing the songs and for musicians to add optional instruments.&#10;&#10;The symbols on the dice represent the most popular words in hit songs from 1890 to date. Roll the dice and try to think of a song lyric with the help of the symbols.&#10; Example: The symbol of the Sun may make you think of Soundgarden's &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot;. Or why not &quot;Summertime, and the living is easy&quot;?

You set up them like in classic memory, hiding pictures. Using a special application for mobile devices (Android or iOS), produced by publisher, you scan QR codes of two cards of your choice. You will hear two recordings. If they are the same, you&rsquo;ve just found the pair. Take these cards and look at the pictures to check if you understand the meaning of the foreign words. If recordings are different, it&rsquo;s not a pair so it&rsquo;s a next player turn.&#10;&#10;The game is now available only in the print-and-play version (in the teacher&rsquo;s pack &quot;Memo The Dragon&quot;, www.memothedragon.pl).

I have played these a few times at parties and with family after being challenged to make up some good social games. Think of these as a replacement for the useless joker cards that accompany every box of playing cards.&#10;&#10;The artwork is all done by my friend JP, which is based upon a concept sketch I give him. He does a great job with the cartoon graphics since these games are meant for people of ages 8+. Great for family outings, waits at the airport, and parties.&#10;&#10;",

The explored territory was called Neuschwabenland (New Swabia) named after the expedition vessel, Schwabenland.&#10;Unnoticed from the rest of the world a secret base was built: The Base 211 and the Reich began to developed progressive weapon systems.&#10;One day, troops on reconnaissance missions disappeared and there were sightings of strange 2m tall worm-like beasts and house-high creatures. &#10;Due to the potential threat, the high command of Neuschwabenland caused a general mobilization to deal with the menace and to gather more informations about the strange creatures...&#10;&#10;Neuschwabenland is a tactical hex and counter combat game for 2 players simulating the hypothetical struggle between forces of the Third Reich and the forces of Alien life forms, in an Arctic setting. The game is also highly suitable for solitaire play.&#10;&#10;The Reich has advanced equipment and special units at disposal, such as the UFO-like flying machine Haunebu.&#10;However, due to the harsh weather conditions they are limited when it comes to unit activation.&#10;&#10;Aliens on the other side fight their enemies by sheer force of numbers and can activate all units.&#10;While they lack the firepower of the Reich (with one exception, the Tripod: A monstrous killing machine), they are very dangerous in close combat.&#10;&#10;The combat system is inspired by the game Space Crusade.&#10;&#10;The game comes with a map (ca. 10 x 18 inch) depicting a part of the Antarctic region, Neuschwabenland, a sheet with 88 (5/8 inch) counters and 6 scenarios.&#10;&#10;",

It combines the fun of an enjoyable game with the discovery of the world of butterflies and some of the most common species in the Mediterranean area.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game, fun apart, is to build the richest habitat, and this is achieved by gaining the maximum number of points: completing butterflies, attracting them with plants, trying to make them breed, or catching them (with final penalisation). You also have to ensure that neither predators nor changes in the weather nor human intervention have a negative influence in the strategy of each player.&#10;&#10;The game is designed for 2-5 players of all ages, and especially from 6 years old to an adult public. We have devised three levels of difficulty so that the learning process is gradual until dominating all the aspects of the game.&#10;&#10;The game has a total of 66 cards, and 40 of them represent butterflies, 17 are actions by the players and 9 refer to the weather. The butterflies chosen represent more or less the variety of diurnal species in the area and the majority are grouped by colours, an approximation to the different families.&#10;&#10;Papilio is a game of simulation yet it is also competitive. This means that the dynamic of the game is agile and with continuous toing and froing, and at the end establishes a score in points that in some way is related to the concept of biodiversity and the biological cycles of these insects.&#10;&#10;Thus there are more points for the butterflies that are free than those caught with butterfly nets. The diversity of the butterflies is also rewarded and the number of species of the same group. Finally, points are scored for the combination of plants and reproduction cards (caterpillars). Moreover, given the vulnerability of these insects, the game includes three species of protected butterflies, rare or in danger of extinction, species that in the game cannot be caught with butterfly nets.&#10;&#10;",

He put all his supplies into the sewer to protect them from tractor beams. Little did we know, zombies would soon infest the sewers and slowly take over your town.&#10;&#10;Run, Dive and Dash your way past Zombies in the sewers. Find the hidden treasures of gas and food and barter your way out of town. If you are lucky enough, you might even find old Earl or his crash test dummy in your fun and crazy adventures.&#10;&#10;This 1-4 player game is rated 13+ and comes with an easy to play rule book and personal deck with unique zombies to plague your adventures.&#10;&#10;Single Player:&#10;&#10;Game play revolves around running through the sewers to collect enough gas and food to barter with so you can get a ride out of town. Sounds easy right? We recommend you try to be careful because there is a limited amount of cards in the deck. The zombies will pop out of you, give you hugs and then go back into the deck. This creates a fun, creative and fun horde mechanic that is both simple and exciting. Can you get all you need before you have nothing left but zombies left in your deck?&#10;&#10;Multiplayer:&#10;&#10;There is only one seat in Earl's truck, and with so many people buying for it, it is up to you to out collect your friends.&#10;&#10;While this setup is designed to work much like single player mechanic wise. The cards are no longer discarded, but go back into the deck to provide nonstop fun. With only ten rounds, you need to collect all you can before your friends do. How can you do this? Simple, bet your friends during their turn to try to wrestle their cards away from them and into your personal pile. Once all the players have a single card of their own, betting opens up and allows you to bet, roll and do whatever it takes to win. Do not worry... The zombie horde is still trying to hug its way to your brains, but can you outpace them and wave goodbye to your friends?&#10;&#10;Follow us here at:&#10;&#10;www.ArchNemesisGames.com&#10;&#10;",

America&rsquo;s Next Top Pimp is a dangerous game of manipulation. Be wary of other pimps trying to take control of the island. The power of your hoes may not suffice.

During each pimp round, one or more pimp fights will occur. When all but one player has played their last card, new cards will be drawn and a new pimp round will begin. At the beginning of each fight, the player with the fight marker will place it on a territory of his/her choosing. This will be the location for the next fight.&#10;&#10;Players begin each round with 10 cards each (8 in a 2 or 3 player game.)&#10;&#10;During a fight, players take turns placing cards in front of them, forming their pimp hand.

In Bring Your Own Book, players take turns drawing prompts from the deck, then race to find the best phrase in their own book that satisfies the prompt. What's the tastiest &ldquo;name for a candy bar&rdquo; in that history textbook you're reading for school? How quickly can you find &ldquo;lyrics from a country western song&rdquo; in your dog-training guide? What kind of &ldquo;advice for graduating seniors&rdquo; will appear in your anthology of limericks?&#10;&#10;In more detail, everyone has their own book and sits in a circle. The cards are placed face down, and the starting player has a one-minute timer. The starting player takes the top card off the deck, picks a prompt, and reads it aloud. Everyone except the Picker searches their book for text to match the prompt, sequential text of any length: a single word, half of a sentence, a whole sentence, multiple sentences, etc.&#10;&#10;The first Seeker to find matching text announces &quot;I've got it&quot; and starts the timer. When the timer runs out (or every Seeker announces &quot;I've got it&quot;), each Seeker reads what they've found. Seekers who didn't find text in time open to a random page and read a random sentence from it. The Picker chooses their favorite submission and awards the card to that Reader. After each round, the person to the left of the last Picker starts the next round. Once any player holds three cards, everyone passes their book to the player on their left. This happens any time a player reaches three cards during the game. Thus, it can happen as many times as there are players.&#10;&#10;The game proceeds until one player has collected the required number of cards and wins: with 5-7 players the first to 4 cards win; with 3-4 players the first to 5 cards win.&#10;&#10;",

Built on simplicity but with potential for complexity these games provide a challenge for players at all levels. Tao of Peg is designed to use a combination of luck and strategy to win in a variety of ways. Tao of Peg is the perfect game for family fun or for more serious gaming nights.&#10;&#10;The board and pegs are made of wood, and the board design is printed on a vinyl sheet and applied directly to a wooden base. The entire board is lightly coated with a protective varnish. Felt buttons are then added to the bottom corners to protect playing surfaces.&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY:&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt four cards. A player begins by discarding a card from their hand. The player then places a game piece in any space with the corresponding color on the board. The turns ends by the player drawing a new card from the pile.&#10;&#10;In addition to the 100 colored playing cards (25 per colored quadrant), each set also has two types of wild cards. Players may play a wild card instead of a colored card. Red wild cards allow the player to remove any game piece in play and black wild cards allow the player to place a game piece anywhere on the board.&#10;&#10;There are four different ways to win;&#10;&#10;    make a row of 5 pegs anywhere on the board&#10;    make a row of 4 pegs in a single quadrant&#10;    place a peg in each corner of a single quadrant&#10;    place a peg in each corner of the game board&#10;&#10;&#10;",

In Moefuda, the players use cards (fuda) with 'Moe' elements, such as 'Tsuinte' (bunches or pigtails), 'Tsundere' (coldness turning to love) and 'Osana-najimi' (childhood friend). Gameplay resembles Apples To Apples as, while one player acts as a judge, the other players use their cards to form combinations from their hands. The players try to make the combo with the most 'Moe' (adorable cuteness) in the view of the judge. The winning combo gets the player a chip, most chips by the end wins.&#10;&#10;A second version of the game &#232;&#144;&#140;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#229;&#165;&#179;&#229;&#173;&#166;&#233;&#153;&#162; (Moefuda Jogakuin) has a High School Girl theme and some changes in the voting method.&#10;&#10;Publisher summary:&#10;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#131;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#131;&#132;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#135;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#229;&#185;&#188;&#233;&#166;&#180;&#230;&#159;&#147;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#232;&#144;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#232;&#166;&#129;&#231;&#180;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#155;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#189;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#173;&#144;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#233;&#129;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#228;&#186;&#140;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#233;&#133;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#232;&#144;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#231;&#181;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#128;&#131;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#229;&#175;&#169;&#229;&#136;&#164;&#229;&#189;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#166;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#233;&#129;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#230;&#150;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#141;&#178;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#185;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#232;&#191;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#231;&#141;&#178;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#229;&#164;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

The local races, hackneyed halflings and dullard dwarves, fail to appreciate the time and toil that goes into perverting the laws of nature and defying death itself.&#10;&#10;And now, after a few singed villages and poisoned wells, the locals are coming for you and your magical brethren. Stout Heroes of the land, mighty warriors and dexterous thieves, pious paladins and wily wizards, have banded together to bust down your gates and evict you from your dark castle.&#10;&#10;Luckily, you are in contact with Dark Masters, beings man was not meant to know. They are ready to provide you dastardly traps, potent spells, and decaying corpses for reanimation, if you can demonstrate your bravery by facing the toughest Heroes.&#10;&#10;Now it&rsquo;s a competition to see which Overlord can withstand the siege. Well... you never liked your neighbors that much anyway.&#10;&#10;Dark Dealings is a quick drafting and combat game for 1-6 players.  You first draft Heroes, then use them to bid for the Defenses that will eventually be their downfall. Players then take turns flipping and fighting their previously drafted Heroes. The last Overlord standing is the winner!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In Dreary Hamlet you will play as an adventurer caught in their weakest moment. In medieval England times are hard, and to feed your family you will be forced to trek into the countryside, where you hope to slay the mysterious beasts that seem to be plaguing the tiny town of Hamlet. You have heard tales of the wretched creatures regurgitated from the Hamletsmaw, and though travellers shout of their horror, they also whisper through drink-numbed lips of the treasures that may be found within their guts.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is simple; be the player with the most loot once every player is dead. The journey there is not such a simple one though.&#10;&#10;Each round of gameplay consists of a day and night phase. Creatures are drawn from a deck and placed in a grid at the centre of the table, where during the day players will choose which to face. Many things will affect the outcome of this combat, such as ammunition type equipped, creature health, defence, and number of attacks, and player health and items. Combat is resolved through dice rolls, and if the player survives they may receive a loot reward. These rewards can be sold for gold, crafted into better items that will be worth more in the future, or eaten to stave off death.&#10;&#10;While players have control during the day, once the sun sets and night settles across the land, the creatures in play will follow them back to camp, setting upon the doomed adventurers. No loot can be won during the chaos of night, leaving survival the only reward to a successful defence.&#10;&#10;At the same time, all players are competing to become the richest hero, so back-stabbing, betrayal, theft, and murder will be in abundance. The most important thing to remember is that death is inevitable, so take joy in your friend's suffering, and race to meet them on the other side!&#10;&#10;",

Each more fantastic than the last all given life and connected by the pure power of thought, creativity, and terror harnessed in a mystical energy source called &quot;Aether&quot;. These Realities exist tethered together in a tumultuous ever growing and ever changing Multiverse. While most worlds are blissfully ignorant many know of it's existence and even travel between the Realities seeking knowledge, riches or power.&#10;&#10;Twisted Skies is a Steampunk card game of Adventure and Intrigue set in the fabulous adventures of the AIRSHIP ISABELLA. Players cooperate to complete daring missions at the start of the game but will double cross and challenge each other as they near victory. Can you master the Steampunk Multiverse?&#10;&#10;Players take control of an elite airship. By manning and equipping the ship and crew, players take turns attempting to complete mission cards in an attempt to earn enough Victory Points to win.  Other players can try to Interrupt the current player from succeeding at a mission, or can form alliances to help each other.&#10;&#10;Twisted Skies is played in a sequence of Phases that make up each player&rsquo;s turn. Players take their turns one at a time proceeding clockwise around a table. The active player taking&#10;their turn is known as the Mission Attempter The Sequence of play for the phases of a turn are as follows:&#10;&#10;1. Ready all Exhausted Cards&#10;2. Draw one Manifest Card&#10;3. First Drop. Place one Crew card into play or Equip a Tech card&#10;4. Open Trading. Players openly trade cards with the Mission Attempter&#10;5. Draw one Catalyst Card. If it is a Mission Card place it on the Table.&#10;6. Mission Attempt. The Mission Attempter tries to gain points by completing Missions.&#10;7. Pirate Trading. Players blindly trade cards from their hands with the Mission Attempter&#10;8. Second Drop. Place one Crew card into play or Equip a Tech card&#10;&#10;Once a player has made the Second Drop (and resolved any effect of that Drop) then their turn is over.&#10;&#10;",

This set can be played as its own special set or it can be integrated with other sets and expansions of Twisted Skies to bring the wonder of the Red Fork Empire to your games of Twisted Skies!&#10;&#10;Players take control of an elite airship. By manning and equipping the ship and crew, players take turns attempting to complete mission cards in an attempt to earn enough Victory Points to win.  Other players can try to Interrupt the current player from succeeding at a mission, or can form alliances to help each other.&#10;&#10;Twisted Skies is played in a sequence of Phases that make up each player&rsquo;s turn. Players take their turns one at a time proceeding clockwise around a table. The active player taking&#10;their turn is known as the Mission Attempter The Sequence of play for the phases of a turn are as follows:&#10;&#10;1. Ready all Exhausted Cards&#10;2. Draw one Manifest Card&#10;3. First Drop. Place one Crew card into play or Equip a Tech card&#10;4. Open Trading. Players openly trade cards with the Mission Attempter&#10;5. Draw one Catalyst Card. If it is a Mission Card place it on the Table.&#10;6. Mission Attempt. The Mission Attempter tries to gain points by completing Missions.&#10;7. Pirate Trading. Players blindly trade cards from their hands with the Mission Attempter&#10;8. Second Drop. Place one Crew card into play or Equip a Tech card&#10;&#10;Once a player has made the Second Drop ( and resolved any effect of that Drop) then their turn is over.&#10;&#10;",

The players represent various Factions vying for control of Arrakis, the desert planet. Each of the 6 playable Factions has a small set of thematical special abilities that allow them to break certain rules in the game.&#10;&#10;Each turn, you will need to politicize, ally and employ the means of Kanly wisely, recruit new troops, ship them to the surface, and attack in just the right spot. Fate, in the form of the dice, can be controlled to a certain degree but still might thwart your plans; Sandstorms and the mighty Shai-Hulud plague the surface of Arrakis; A charismatic leader might tip the balance in a forlorn combat in your favour.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one Faction or Alliance is in control of a certain number of Arrakis&rsquo; strategic Regions at the end of their turn, or after 6 whole rounds.&#10;&#10;Inspired by and based on both, this game tries to find a middle ground between the complexity and duration of Dune and the excessive simplicity of Dune Express while staying true to former&rsquo;s general feel and steering closer to the lore of the original novels than both. Sounds a bit ambitious, I know.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In a distant kingdom, the royal palace is in turmoil.  After one of the king's tasters dies of poisoning, the king no longer knows who to trust within his closest circle of confidants.&#10;&#10;There is the Queen, who he married to secure the relationship with the neighboring kingdom, but who does not share the love he has for her.  Their daughter, the Princess, next in line to inherent the crown and friends with enemies of the king.  The Bishop, who has spoken aloud that the king should be replaced by a spiritual leader.  The Knight, just back from war with the neighboring kingdom and in a rage that the war had ended through marriage and not bloodshed.   The Rook, who has become senile in his old age and now wandering the halls of the castle aimlessly.  And the Pawn, ready to rise up in the ranks of the royalty by any means necessary.&#10;&#10;Can you help protect the king through the seasons of time and ensure that he remains atop his throne?  Or will the tyrants prevail and take his crown from you?&#10;&#10;En Passant (from French: in passing) is a special move in chess that allows an opponent to capture another pawn &quot;as it passes&quot; which was the inspiration for this game.&#10;&#10;In this 16-card playing card game each player is dealt four cards.  The player with the King card in their hand goes first.  Starting with that player, each player plays a card and performs the action listed.  For example, one card may have you steal another players card.  Or another card may have everyone pass their hands to the player on their left.&#10;&#10;Your goal is to keep track of the King Card as he travels from player to player.  Once someone is only left with one card the round ends and the player with the King Card gets a point.  The first player to 3 points wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "This card game is based on the game theory of the Prisoner's Dilemma. The theory explores why two purely &quot;rational&quot; individuals might not cooperate, even if it is in their best interest to do so.&#10;&#10;In the prisoner's dilemma story, two prisoners are separated and have the option to confess to the crime or deny any involvement. If both prisoners confess, they will get 2 years. If one confesses and other denies involvement, the one who confesses will get 10 years. If they both deny involvement they both get 3 years.&#10;&#10;When the story plays out, the prisoner's choose their self interest over the risk of possibly getting less jail time if they both confess.&#10;&#10;Our card game uses that same idea but expands on it to allow for up to 5 prisoners and includes some added incentives to keep things interesting.&#10;&#10;PLAYING&#10;&#10;Each player draws an Incentive Card, looks at it and places it face down in front of them. Dice are rolled and placed on the Jail Card and Reward Card. Each player selects a Color Card from their hand and plays it face down in front of them. The Witness Color Card is turned over so that everyone can see the color. All players reveal their Color Card and Incentive Card at the same time.&#10;&#10;Starting with the player color card who matches the Witness, any player who can play a Incentive Card decides how to use it: Alibi, Bribe, Double-Cross, Bully, Outsmart, Threaten.&#10;&#10;Colors Cards are counted up by color. The player whose color has the most cards gets negative points matching the die on the jail card. The player whose color has the least cards gets positive points matching the die on the reward card. If there is a tie, all of the tying players each receive the negative points.&#10;&#10;Points are recorded for each player and the round is over and everything starts over again.&#10;&#10;First player to 21 points wins.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Intended for families who enjoy strategy-based games, PaNiC STaTioNS is a card game suitable for 2 to 4 players age 8 to 80.&#10;&#10;The cards are first set out in a square to form the playing area. Some of the cards are kept back to ensure that it is more difficult to predict what you will land on. The cards are initially face-down and Tokens are placed on the cards.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to collect 10 Tokens and then be the player who turns the last card face-up.&#10;&#10;Each player has two Pawns which are moved around the cards according to the role of two dice. During the first phase of the game Tokens are collected when a player lands on the cards. The card is then turned face-up and any instructions followed. For example it could be a &quot;Booby-Trap&quot; card which forces your Pawn out of play. In which case you need to roll a 6 to bring it back in to play.&#10;&#10;During the second phase of the game most of the Cards will have been turned-face up and most of the Tokens collected. It now becomes more important to keep both Pawns in play to give you some flexibility in choosing which cards you land on. You and your rivals will be trying to force Pawns out of play, trying to steal Tokens, and generally attempting to turn the last card face-up. The cards have various effects which assist (or hinder) you in this. Many of the cards interact with each other. For example if a rival's Pawn is on the &quot;Philanthropy&quot; card (which obliges him to give away 2 Tokens every time somebody else's Pawn goes out of play) it could be a good move to land on &quot;Maelstrom&quot; which forces all Pawns out of play. Most of the cards have effects that can be used to advantage in this way.&#10;Each turn you also have the option of rolling the &quot;Panic Die&quot; which gives you other alternatives. You may choose to do this, for example, if your initial dice roll was particularly disadvantageous of if another player is about to win. You do however have the chance of losing half your Tokens - but even this can be turned to your advantage if you realise how.&#10;&#10;",

You&rsquo;ll have to build your deck to achieve the goals you&rsquo;ve been tasked for. Gear up your troops for the battle; deploy all type of units: armor, artillery and transport units; request air support and deceive your enemy. Lead Patton or Rommel to the final victory; seize buildings; destroy your enemy and conquer the battlefield! Play historical scenarios: go ashore in Normandy, defend Monte Cassino or dig in the Ardennes!&#10;&#10;You can play 2GM TWG in two ways. You can play a &ldquo;Battle Royal&rdquo; - players will establish a number of points, they will set up the battlefield prior commencing the battle and the goal is to destroy your opponent&rsquo;s Head Quarter; or you can play a &ldquo;Scenario&rdquo; &ndash; historical or not &ndash; with a predefined set of rules to deploy units and the terrain, and pre-established conditions of victory.&#10;&#10;In a player&rsquo;s turn you&rsquo;ll gain a number of &ldquo;Action Points&rdquo; that will be used to deploy new units on the battlefield and to employ other supporting cards. These Action Points will increase by several ways as the game evolves.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Objectives&rdquo; to achieve the victory during a game are very diverse: from destroying your opponent&rsquo;s HQ to capture the battlefield or inflict a specific number of kills to your enemy. Seizing or bombing a building, capturing enemy&rsquo;s supplies, rescue a flag objective or hold a position for a number of turns are other ways to achieve the victory.&#10;&#10;The game includes three different decks: one for the American Army, one for the German Army and a third double-sided deck to represent different types of Terrain.&#10;&#10;Each side&rsquo;s deck is composed by cards representing unique types of units and supporting cards. Different types of units - infantry, vehicle, armor, aircraft and transport -, all with their own specific capabilities and with additional equipment to be deployed.&#10;&#10;Supporting cards are assorted: you may find &ldquo;Equipment&rdquo;, &ldquo;Promotion&rdquo;, &ldquo;Mines&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Diversion&rdquo;, among others.&#10;&#10;Terrain deck includes anything that is needed to make every single battle a unique experience.&#10;&#10;Additionally, you&acute;ll find Help and Summary cards along with Flag Generals that will improve your army with their command abilities; 2d10 and more than 100 counters (damage counters, victory points, etc.) and additional equipment to gear up our units depending on the situation.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Letter Chess is a solitaire word game that combines Word Search and Chess. Players move letters like Chess pieces to string together words that connect horizontally, vertically and diagonally on a 7-by-9 grid. To score big assemble long words and make sure you have a end of game strategy to clear the board.&#10;&#10;Setup: 48 Letter tiles are randomized on a 7-by-9 grid. At the start of the game there are 15 empty squares near the center of the board. The center horizontal row is always empty. Bordering the center row, two rows are made up of four empty squares and three letter squares (like a parapet which is the alternate name). Use any word game you may own to play the game.&#10;&#10;Game Mechanics: The main object of the game is to assemble words on the grid. Eligible words must have letters connected on the board horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Acceptable words must be at least three letters long. Words cannot be played more than once per game and proper nouns are not allowed. Individual letter tiles cannot be used twice in the same word (such as &ldquo;o&rdquo; twice to spell book or &ldquo;d&rdquo; to spell dad).&#10;&#10;During a single turn, a player can move multiple letters together to construct words. All letters moved during a turn must be used to construct a word that round. Consonants can move any number of squares horizontally, vertically or diagonally (like a Queen in Chess) to an empty square. When moved, however, consonants cannot jump over other letters. Vowels can move two squares horizontally and one square vertically, or two squares vertically and one square horizontally (like a Knight in Chess) to an empty square. Unlike consonants, vowels can jump over other letters. After a word is constructed those letter tiles are removed from the board and play continues. The game ends when all letters have been used or no more plays are left. Lastly, the letter &ldquo;Y&rdquo; moves as a consonant even if used as a vowel.&#10;&#10;Scoring: Letter Chess uses simple formulas to tally a score at the end of the game. So when playing keep a pencil and paper nearby. Vowels count as 2 points and Consonants count as 1 point. The letter &ldquo;Y&rdquo; counts as one point even if used as a vowel. A word is tallied by multiplying the letter score by the letter count. For example, &ldquo;murals&rdquo; has a tally of forty because there is a letter score of eight (two vowels and four consonants) and a letter count of five (8x5=40). There is a bonus score when all the letters are cleared from the board. The bonus is calculated by multiplying the number of rounds by 10 and subtracting that amount from 200 (arbitrary number). For example, a whole board was cleared in twelve rounds then 200-(12X10)= 80 points. When letters remain on the board with no more moves left those letters are tallied as a word and subtracted from the score. For example if the letters &ldquo;I, X and O&rdquo; remain on the board. The letter score is 5 and letter count is 3 which equals 15 minus points.&#10;&#10;At most there are 16 rounds per game assuming all words are 3-letters long. In Letter Chess, a high score is in the 400&rsquo;s and a low score is around 200.&#10;&#10;",

Challenge your friends to see who can build the highest stack of words!&#10;&#10;&#10;Spelligator is a children's game designed to teach simple vocabulary, spelling and phonics.  Each player has a plastic &quot;Spelligator&quot; with three shaped spaces on its back.  Players then take turns turning over letter tiles, each of which can fit only in the beginning, middle or end space.  Each tile is printed with either a single letter, a blend or a digraph.  If the player can add the tile to his or her Spelligator's back to make a new word, it is added.  If not, the tile is turned back face down.  When all the tiles are used or no more words can be made, the player with the highest stack on his or her Spelligator's back wins.&#10;&#10;",

The game consists of 20 pairs of rhyming picture cards, each of which is cut like a puzzle piece on one edge, so that each card only fits with its designated pair, and when fit together will form a rhyming phrase (e.g. &quot;a dragon in a wagon&quot;).  Anywhere from six to twenty left-side cards are laid out in a line.  Each player takes a turn choosing a right-side card and trying to match it with one left-side card to make a rhyme.  If the match is correct, the player keeps the pair.  If not, the tile is returned.  Play continues until all pairs are matched and the player with the most pairs wins.&#10;&#10;",

With the Rebel pieces starting on the outer perimeter, and the Agents starting in a tight group around the Nexus, it can be displayed how far the revolt must go and how much larger it must grow in order to challenge the government for ultimate power. However, being out in the margins allows time to organize and gather strength....&#10;&#10;",

Whichever side overcomes its disadvantage wins (the State by gaining information on the Insurgents and killing them; the Insurgents by penetrating to the centre of State power).&#10;&#10;The Insurgent wins by capturing the Capital. This is accomplished by having, at the end of any his player-turns, Insurgent pieces occupying either four connected spaces in the Inner Circle (that is, there are at least four Insurgent-occupied spaces in the Inner Circle that also share a border with one or two other Insurgent-occupied spaces in the Inner Circle), or occupying any six of the twelve spaces of the Inner Circle.&#10;&#10;The State player wins by killing 12 Insurgent pieces (so making an Insurgent victory impossible).&#10;&#10;Originally designed in 2011 for an online game site, from an idea by Michael Freeman.&#10;&#10;",

Players each have their own deck of staple cards.

The winner is the player with the most verse cards at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Our first version &ldquo;Salvation&rdquo; includes Bible verses focused on the Gospel. As your family plays, you are reinforcing Scripture memory in a fun yet challenging way.&#10;&#10;There are 12 verse cards, 14 action cards and 28 word cards in the 54 card deck.&#10;&#10;Why the Salvation theme?&#10;&#10;1 Peter 3:15 says, &quot;But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:&quot;&#10;&#10;Through testing the game play I learned that there are some Christians who have been Christians for years that don't know some of the foundational  scriptures used in this game.&#10;&#10;My goal is to help players of all ages be ready to share the hope of the Gospel by helping them memorize scriptures that will allow them to share their faith with confidence.&#10;&#10;The initial production run will be in the King James version.

Each player has a card with as series of pictures labeled with the corresponding words. The caller calls out a vowel sound--long a, for example--and players must search their card for a word/picture with a long a in the word. When a player has a complete row, their card is checked by the caller to make sure the vowels are identified correctly. If so, the player wins. If not, play continues until someone has a correct row.&#10;&#10;",

In this battle Ottoman forces advanced northwards, towards the present day Bulgarian-Romanian frontier. Russian infantry and cannons were able to stall the polyglot Ottoman army, and although they managed to eke out a marginal victory their commander, General Kutuzov, chose to yield the key town of Rousse to the Ottomans, convincing them they had won a great victory. The Czar was not pleased.&#10;&#10;Slobozia 20 focuses on the latter battle of 2 October 1811. In this engagement Kutuzov conducted a surprise march which cut off and surrounded the bulk of the Ottoman army, trapping it on the northern (Bulgarian) shore of the Danube. The result was a decisive Russian victory that permitted negotiations to end the war. This had the dual advantage of allowing Russia to transfer key reserves to oppose Napoleon&rsquo;s invasion of Russia in 1812, and also prevented Austria from contributing more forces to support the French invasion.&#10;&#10;",

Of course, the other lawyers are also secretly protecting one of the mages.&#10;&#10;In The Gallows each player is secretly defending one of the characters in the center.  On your turn you add one vote token to any character and then move one vote token from a character to a different character.  Once a character has enough votes they are executed.  Whoever had the most votes on a character when they are executed scores the conviction worth one point.  When only one character remains in the middle, whoever was protecting them scores an acquittal worth lots of points.&#10;&#10;Play consists of players trying to manipulate the votes so they score convictions and prevent their own defendant from getting convicted.&#10;&#10;",

Now you&rsquo;re back in town, healed up, cleaned up, and ready to party at the Red Dragon Inn. Drink, gamble, and roughhouse with your friends. But don&rsquo;t forget to keep an eye on your gold. If you run out, you&rsquo;ll have to spend the night in the stables. Oh&hellip; and try not to get too beaten up or too drunk. If you black out, your friends will continue the party without you&hellip; after they loot your body for gold, of course! The last conscious adventurer with gold wins the game!&#10;&#10;The Red Dragon Inn 5: The Character Trove is a standalone game for 2-4 players. It expands on &quot;The Red Dragon Inn&quot; family of box sets and single-character expansions called Allies. You can mix and match characters from any of these sets, letting you build the party composition of your choice! Each of the box sets includes four unique characters, a drink deck, gold pieces, and all the parts for 2-4 players to play right out of the box. Each of the Allies expansions includes a character deck as well as gold pieces and bits so you can add another character to a box set (thus making a 2-4 player collection playable by 2-5 players).&#10;&#10;Sera the Fleetfooted: Sera is a stealthy rogue whose speed and agility allow her to take down roomfuls of bad guys before they even know what&rsquo;s happening. The dungeon&rsquo;s beefiest monsters are no match for her flying daggers! She didn&rsquo;t get so skilled by slacking off, though. Even while she&rsquo;s partying, she continues training to make sure she&rsquo;s always at the top of her game.&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Good: She hones her skills by sparring with her friends.&#10;    The Bad: Sometimes she does this without warning them first&hellip;&#10;&#10;&#10;Lizwick the Collector: Lizwick is a consummate problem solver with an unrivaled collection of gear. Her wondrous Bag of Holding contains rare and peculiar items of all descriptions. She is always on the lookout for the next amazing whatchamacallit to add to her collection. Lizwick has gotten The Party out of many a jam with the clever application of the wrong tool at the right time.&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Good: Lizwick&rsquo;s collection is the envy of academies, guilds and hoarders alike!&#10;    The Bad: &hellip;and they&rsquo;d like their stuff back.&#10;&#10;&#10;Joran the Trickster: Joran&rsquo;s penchant for pranks earned him a student &ldquo;sabbatical&rdquo; from the Mage&rsquo;s Collegium. Fortunately, Zot saw some potential in the boy, and decided to take him adventuring for some valuable field experience. The young mage&rsquo;s humor has proven to be mostly harmless to his new friends. He puts his clever brain to good use by pulling fast ones on the bad guys.&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Good: Joran&rsquo;s talent for misdirection makes him the perfect weapon against enemy spell-casters.&#10;    The Bad: It also makes him the perfect weapon against his friends&rsquo; gold, their sobriety, their patience&hellip;&#10;&#10;&#10;Zakhan the Drunken Master: Zakhan&rsquo;s father is a solemn elven noble and a guru of meditative martial combat techniques. His mother was a rowdy barbarian warchief with a penchant for throwing wild parties. This unique heritage has allowed Zakhan to hone a seemingly reckless hybrid fighting style of his own. His opponents who underestimate his &ldquo;drunken&rdquo; martial arts do so at their own peril!&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Good: Zakhan&rsquo;s drunken fighting techniques make him a formidable foe.&#10;    The Bad: Sometimes he&rsquo;s actually just drunk.&#10;&#10;&#10;But wait, there's more! The Red Dragon Inn 5: The Character Trove is also a massive storage solution for all previous sets (with room for more). You get a massive storage box plus dividers, new play mats for all previously released characters, updated tokens and more!

Players may orient the counters in any direction.&#10;&#10;Play: Beginning with the wyrm player, each player takes a turn by rotating, moving and combatting.&#10;&#10;Rotating - A player may rotate their counter 60&deg; clockwise or counterclockwise.&#10;&#10;Moving - The player may then move any counter 1 hex in distance in any direction, maintaining the counter&rsquo;s current orientation. If the player chose not to rotate a counter they may instead move a counter 2 hexes in distance.&#10;&#10;Combatting - After rotating, and/or moving, a player may attack one adjacent piece of the opposing player with any of their counters. A player may only attack in the directions indicated by the red arrows (arrows must point perpendicular to an adjacent hex side). Players each roll one six-sided die, the attacking player gains a +1 to their roll.&#10;&#10;If the attacker&rsquo;s roll is greater than the defender, the defending piece is removed.&#10;&#10;If the defender has more than one counter adjacent to the attacking counter and they have lost combat, they may immediately combat once as a new attacker, before the start of their normal turn.

Will you be the quartermaster to give everyone their fair share &ndash; but giving yourself the best share?&#10;&#10;Each round in Booty, cards representing treasures are revealed.

        "description": "COMPONENTS&#10;Base set contains 54 unique Cards, Token Punchboard, the game's Board and Rulebook. The Extended version contains 84 unique cards, as opposed to 54 cards in the regular set.&#10;&#10;OVERVIEW&#10;Gomora : Downtown is a Neo-noir card game for 2-4 players. It can be played 1vs1, 2vs2 (co-op mode) or Free for all. The game is for ages 15+ and it lasts 15-45 minutes.&#10;&#10;You are a detective in the city of Gomora. You will take a path between good and evil in a corrupt city full of eccentric and controversial characters. Nothing can be taken for granted. Your goal is to try and solve perplexing crimes that implicate multiple powerful interests. Gomora's criminal underbelly is after you....so hurry up detective.&#10;&#10;This game consists of 84 cards each with a unique photo-realistic artwork. There are 4 tokens representing the 8 Detectives and a game board with 4 locations to move around in order to find clues and complete your case.&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY&#10;When your turn starts you draw a card or you store cards under your case. Then you have to move to a different location and play it's ability if you wish to. The third step allows you to play your cards. Alternatively you can rest during the third step so that you recover one life point. After you are done playing cards, make sure to keep only 4 cards in your hand and you turn is over.&#10;&#10;PROLOGUE&#10;How did you get here? What did you do? Why are they after you? In the city of Gomora the rules are made by those who rule the streets, and those who govern the masses are in their back pocket. The city is corrupt to the bone. Nothing is clear and no man knows what is true and what is fiction, which is convenient for some. Pacifism is not an option. If you pretend to be &ldquo;good&rdquo;, you&lsquo;ll probably end up in a ditch, or worse. If you pretend to be &ldquo;bad&rdquo;, vengeance will be upon you sooner or later. The only way forward is to lurk in the shadows, stay unseen until the day you&rsquo;ll do what needs to be done. Believe in what you feel rather than what you see, because in this town nothing is what it seems.&#10;Every day in Gomora is a struggle for survival and as far as I know&hellip; today is not a good day for you to die.&#10;&#10;Show them what you 've got detective..&#10;&#10;STORY&#10;Bloody Sunday 6am.... Agent's Kiran and Mark have just arrived in the crime scene three miles away from Casino Montenegro.&#10;Mark:- Morning Mike...so what&rsquo;s the story?&#10;Officer Mike:- Good day to you Sir...&#10;Mark:- It doesn't seem like one...but please continue.&#10;Officer Mike:- It looks like this poor guy has been shot several times by a Niner last night. The doc said the hit was around midnight.&#10;Mark:- Any evidence gathered?&#10;Officer Mike:- Not yet Sir. We are still examining the surroundings. Just got here half an hour ago.&#10;Kiran:- Ok then we will be down town taking our breakfast so if you have any news from the morgue or the crime scene contact Gloria in 4237. We will take it from there (Agents walking away).&#10;Deputy Jones: (shouting)- Agent Kiran...!!&#10;Kiran:- Yes how can I help you Deputy Jones (walks towards him).&#10;Deputy Jones:- May I have a word with you in private?&#10;Kiran:- Sure...lets walk.&#10;Deputy Jones:- I have found this note. The guy was holding it but in a way that if somebody placed it there...in his grip.&#10;Kiran:- And why are you giving that to me old friend (smiles)?&#10;Deputy Jones:- Just take a look and you'll understand why (Deputy Jones grasps Kiran&rsquo;s shoulder).&#10;After a while in the car&#10;Mark:- (after a few minutes of silence) What's wrong man? Come on spit it out... &#10;Kiran:- It's nothing... Old Jones just wanted to give me some guidelines... Not a big deal.&#10;Mark:- Sure thing...now pass me over that note he gave you.&#10;Kiran:-(surprised) Ok Mark you win....the note was from Fox. I guess we will have to cover that up again....any ideas?&#10;Mark:- (speaks with emphasis) And again she strikes without warning....that crazy b#*@$. &#10;Kiran:- You know that this will start a war right?&#10;Mark:- This was Viny's little brother there&hellip; I am prepared for everything....&#10;&#10;",

A time when artists, architects and writers explored the nature and potential of man and a time when horizons were broadened so far, that a whole new world was discovered!&#10;&#10;In Renaissance Wars you play the game as a Renaissance Luminary... someone whose influence and fame has transcended his own time! Using only your unique Luminary powers, the cards in your hand and cunning strategy, you will battle up to 3 opponents to accumulate the wealth and power necessary to dominate each era of the game.&#10;&#10;But be careful... because when you least expect it, something may occur that completely upsets the balance of power and may destroy even the most carefully laid plans!&#10;&#10;The base game contains 6 playable Luminaries - William Shakespeare, Martin Luther, Fillipo Brunelleschi, St. Ignatius of Loyola, Christopher Columbus and Francis Bacon - all of which come with their own unique Luminary Mats, cards and portaits. Up to 6 more Luminaries will be available in Special Editions.&#10;&#10;Unique Event and Intrusion cards are randomly seeded into the game during set-up, so you never know exactly what you may encounter!&#10;&#10;Featuring beautiful art and history, Renaissance Wars explores the people and events that made the Renaissance one of most interesting, creative and important historical eras.&#10;&#10;",

Gary Shaft, a captain in the American Navy, is on the hunt for the submarine and, most importantly, the gold. Meanwhile, Hajime Yamamoto stockpiles ammunitions and weapons to mine the incoming American Fleet.&#10;&#10;A generation later...&#10;&#10;America Shaft looks on as her son Kirk dives deeper than he has ever swam before checking on a local tip about the Nazi Gold. The modern spy and government infiltrator, Olli Valentiner, manipulates the local governments, listing the Shafts as enemies of state. In other news, a string of murders has occurred across Asia as the twins, Hero and Kira Yamamoto leave their mark on the traitors who lost their family&rsquo;s wealth.&#10; GOALS&#10;&#10;Sub Runners is a card-driven deduction game for three players. Players take on the roles of three families: The Erdharts, The Shafts, or The Yamamotos. Players gather resources across the world trying to complete their initial goals. The Erhardts: to make three gold deposits, The Yamamotos: to sink the search Corvette, and The Shafts: to sink the submarine. Once the submarine has been mined, Heinrich dies, or the submarine completes three drops, it crashes somewhere in the vast ocean.&#10;&#10;The final goals now come to bear. The Shafts must find the crash in the ocean and then recover the gold. The Yamamotos may recover the gold or kill all the other players. The Erhardts may kill the other players or defend the crash site until one of the play decks has been exhausted to win.&#10;&#10;",

Legendary Showdown: Machines &amp; Magic is a game of comically epic battles where each player uses strategy, sabotage, and one-upmanship to develop a secret battle plan.  This lighthearted and easy-to-learn tabletop game is designed to be enjoyed by experienced gamers and newcomers alike.  Haven&rsquo;t read the comics before? No problem! No background reading is required to help your characters win battles and be the last one left standing! Let the mass chaos, devious strategies, and humorous battles begin!&#10;&#10;Who is this Girl Genius?&#10;Girl Genius is a three-time winner of the highest honor awarded for works of science fiction and fantasy: the prestigious Hugo Award.  The webcomic follows Agatha Clay, a seemingly mild-mannered mechanic who discovers she has inherited the abilities of a spark (a feared mad scientist with the natural ability to understand complex sciences and wield them for their own chaotic purposes). Even more shocking, Agatha discovers that she is the descendent of a long lost line of sparks whose unparalleled skills and insanity made them legends in their own time.  Cleverly written and beautifully illustrated by Kaja and Phil Foglio, Girl Genius is full of adventure, romance, and plenty of MAD SCIENCE!&#10;&#10;What is this &ldquo;Gunnerkrigg Court&rdquo; of which you speak?&#10;This highly praised comic is the work of the celebrated author and artist, Tom Siddell.  The story follows Antimony Carver as she attends an isolated boarding school called Gunnerkrigg Court.  Antimony soon learns that the Court is no ordinary school - the teachers are hiding ancient conspiracies, it is bordered by a forest full of dangerous monsters, and the school is inhabited by strange creatures and students with special abilities.  In the course of her adventures, Antimony befriends an ancient trickster god, discovers her own supernatural powers, and begins investigating the dark secrets of the court.&#10;&#10;Why do we love these comics so darn much?&#10;If you aren&rsquo;t already faithful readers, allow me to let you in on a little secret: these comics rock.  The stories are masterfully crafted, the art is top notch, and the characters are instantly endearing.  It's no wonder that these comics have won so many rewards and attracted such loyal fans.  We also appreciate that both comics feature characters who make great role models.  For example, Antimony Carver and Agatha Clay are some of the strongest and most intelligent women you could hope to meet and their friends will stop at nothing to stand by their sides.&#10;&#10;How to play the game that will... change your life:&#10;Each player is dealt a total of five characters from the worlds of Girl Genius and Gunnerkrigg Court.  These characters line up in anticipation for their chance to battle.  During the round, you try to equip characters in your line with powerful weapons and bonuses while equipping characters in other players&rsquo; lines with faulty or otherwise terrible equipment.  You can also give yourself secret advantages or sabotage your opponents.  When the round ends, the characters at the front of each line will engage in a (legendary) showdown.  But the madness doesn&rsquo;t stop there!  You can rearrange your line and the lines of your opponents to change who will be competing in the final battle.  The round suddenly ends when all players but one (the poor chap) are ready to fight.  At that point, each player reveals his or her battle strategy and the winner is decided.&#10;&#10;",

The game is asymmetric &ndash; one player (or a team of up to three) attacks the castle, and the other player (or team) is defending it. Knight models come in six colours. All knights are armed with either swords or maces. The blue ones always attack the castle, and are the only team to have two catapults. The red ones always defend. Four of the red knights have bows and arrows instead of melee weapons. The remaining four teams are black, orange, yellow and green. The number of knights in different teams is not always the same. There are always more defenders than attackers. Combat is conducted in duels. Mace wielding combatants have the upper hand, but the outcome is decided by rolling the dice. Each player is trying to overpower their opponents by outnumbering them in isolated combats. Apart from the knights, the box also includes a king, a queen, a princess, a wizard, a dragon and a squire. These models are used in special scenarios.&#10;&#10;",

You&rsquo;ve evacuated the parking lot and setup your equipment; you begin to examine the bomb when suddenly the bomb timer starts to countdown from 16 minutes and your heart rate just went into overdrive.  Upon further inspection you notice the bomb is controlled by an encrypted code sequencer and you need to figure out how to connect your Code Analyzer to the bomb&rsquo;s timer.  Your new high-tech Code Analyzer is used to bypass the bomb&rsquo;s timer and prevent the bomb from exploding. To do this you must figure out the wiring sequence from the mass of wires in front of you and rewiring the device to include your code analyzer, which will override the timer and allow you to defuse the bomb safely!  You have less than 16 minutes to figure out the wiring sequence and connect your Code Analyzer.  If you can figure out this circuit and connect each of the four individual wires from the bomb timer to your code analyzer, you will safely stop the timer and eventually defuse the bomb; saving the resort from certain disaster!  Countdown to disaster begins&hellip;&#10;&#10;Countdown to Disaster is a combination tile placement, card management game and race against the clock style game. Your Code Analyzer has [4] color coded wires &ldquo;Red, Green, Blue and Yellow&rdquo; which must be connected to the timer of the bomb so as to be able to bypass the timer and prevent the bomb from exploding! These connections will be made through the [16] wire routing tiles on the game board. The bomb itself is amass of wires, which is represented by the 4x4 grid of wire tiles on the game board that are routed in different directions to try and prevent you from defusing the robot. Your goal is to figure out the four individual wire routes to connect your code analyzer to the robot's timer. You must figure out a complete connection route for each wire from the code analyzer to the bomb's timer before the timer runs out and the bomb explodes!&#10;You have special wiring tools that allow you to manipulate the wires and create or change the route of each existing wire or wires. With your tools in hand you can swap wires vertically and horizontally 1, 2, or 3 spaces. You can also rotate the direction of a specific wire or wire group up to 360 degrees. The last tool allows you to actually cut out &ldquo;replace&rdquo; a wire or wire group with a new wire or wire group from the bottom four tiles! When you replace a wire or wire group you can rotate the tile to the position of your choice.&#10;&#10;",

This is defined by the special reminder card. &#10;As the game proceeds, each participant will be playing character cards from their hand, giving opponents hints that help them to figure out who their character is. When the player makes up his mind, he can play a special Sword card to attack his target (the player who represents the character he hunts) or a special Shield card to protect himself from someone, who, as he thinks, might attack him. At the end of the round players score victory points for attacking or defending from the right character.&#10;&#10;",

Taking on roles of powerful mystical characters like the Druid, the Shaman or the Wizard, players will brew potions to grow their magical power, while casting spells to stop others from getting ahead. Cauldron is a resource management game that plays with 2-5 players aged 10+ in 1 hour.&#10;&#10;Play revolves around a central set of fields, producing potion ingredients each season (frog legs, spider webs, dragon eggs etc). Each player has potions - way to combine ingredients to score Magik (game's victory points and currency). Players take turns harvesting ingredients, brewing potions and attempting to steal ingredients from competitors. Each player also has a hand of spells - one-time effects that help the player or hinder opponents. Each character has variable powers that modifies the way basic actions are resolved.&#10;&#10;After all ingredients have been harvested, players have a chance to invest some of their Magik to buy additional potions, spells or add fields to the game board. Balancing investment with advancement is a crucial part of the game.&#10;&#10;The game proceeds until one of the player reaches 35 Magik - that player is the winner. The game has an element of luck and conflict present but the majority of it revolves around resource management, planning and balancing short and long term investment.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Chaos Tactics is a dexterity game where skill and strategy are needed to defeat your opponent by using your army of eight units. Players battle over a series of rounds by flicking their units until one player claims the entire board. Each army contains seven different unit types with one type, the soldier, having two units per side. The six non soldier units have special abilities that can be used throughout the game. The constant action will create chaotic battles making each round feel like an entirely new game.&#10; The player using the blue pieces starts the game by choosing one of their pieces and flicking it. Once the piece is flicked, resolve any special abilities if applicable. The red player then takes their first turn by doing the same. Play alternates like this until the round is over; with the goal being to knock all of the opponent&rsquo;s pieces off the game board entirely. If any part of a piece is still on the game board, it is still in play.&#10;&#10;A round is won when only one color remains on the board. With each round won, the winner claims a new row allowing them to place a piece or pieces in that row in the next round. For the following rounds, players may place their pieces in any of the spaces of the rows they own, with at least one piece in the row closest to their opponent.&#10;&#10;The game is won when one color has claimed all eight rows.&#10;&#10;Inspired by Chapayev&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Swamped is a semi-cooperative game of adventure, peril and treasure in which players move through a swamp searching for a rare herb that can cure diseases. Each player takes a turn steering the boat to find the herb. But the swamp has many other treasures as well, so players may try to steer the boat away from its intended goal to increase their own wealth.&#10;&#10;Swamped is a game for 2-4 adventurers that plays in about 30 minutes and expands the vibrant world of Antidote. In addition to a one-of-a-kind theme, there are five core elements that make Swamped incredibly fun and a surprisingly unique gaming experience:&#10;&#10;1. Player-shared pieces: All players share ownership of the same tiny boat in the swamp, so the actions of any one player impact every other player directly.&#10;&#10;2. Secret and shared objectives: Everyone knows the main objective, but each player also has a hidden goal that might lead the whole expedition into deadly peril!&#10;&#10;3. Player controlled game-length: Players can speed-up or slow-down the game down depending on their preference. Some will try to get out of the swamp quickly, while others will delay until they've collected precisely the right combination of treasures.&#10;&#10;4. Surprise ending: It is unlikely that anyone can know with 100% certainty who has won the game before each player's secret objective is revealed, leading to an exciting reveal at the very end!&#10;&#10;5. Efficient use of physical components: Despite its small size (35 cards and two pieces), most cards have multiple uses and orientations leading to a surprisingly deep set of decisions each player can make. Furthermore, as players move deeper into the swamp, the swamp expands from the action card deck, opening up greater adventure, while at the same time triggering a built-in game timer.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "A strategic cycling parlor game for 2-4 players, 8 years and above&#10;&#10;Will your team win the tour?&#10;Going for the yellow or do you choose for the team? Climbing the hills or pushing it on a flat stage?&#10;Keep in mind you&rsquo;re not the only one cycling the road&hellip; A small steering error, misjudgment or a &lsquo;cycling strategy&rsquo; can cause a sensational collision.&#10;Let your cycling team ride as fast as possible and win the bike race!&#10;&#10;Introduction&#10;In this parlor game you play within the stages as a cycling team. A team consists of three riders. The basic game can be played with 2 to 4 players. The duration of a one stage game with 4 players is 1 to 1.5 hours.&#10;. The results of your team and players standings are recorded. A Tour consists of several stages, with the fastest rider over several stages wearing the yellow jersey. You decide for how long and which stages you want to play.&#10;The game is played with cards. By placing a card on the table you decide how fast you are moving your riders on the trail. You try taking tactical moves and benefit from wind advantage by letting your opponent do the hard work. Cast or save your good cards to d&eacute;marrage when you feel that your opponent cannot. In short: &ldquo;Linkeballen&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;Note:&#10;If you have the additions as well, you can play up to 24 players.&#10;&#10;",

The object of the game is to crack the secret code of your opponent by means of simple logic and deduction. Players challenge each other in turn by setting out a row of three, four or five coloured code counters according to the level of skill and difficulty to be played. The game can be made even tougher by allowing the code maker to use any number of the same coloured counters, and or leave spaces, to make up the code.&#10;&#10;The code maker sets up the sliding screen so that it is placed directly in front of them just allowing space to place and hide their secret code in the spaces provided. The code breaker must try to duplicate the exact colours and positions of the secret code. Each attempt is marked with a tick for an exact colour and position match or a cross for the correct colour but incorrect position.&#10;&#10;Players swap roles and the winner is the one who breaks the code in the least number of attempts.&#10;&#10;",

However, the fickle Panda Laws of Adorableness change often, and with them which pandas are adorable. Playing your pandas cleverly and navigating the Laws well will reward you in bamboo! You want that.&#10;&#10;The gameplay of Adorable Pandaring is easy to learn. The deck consists of four copies each of ten pandas, numbered 1-10, and four Panda Law cards [High(6-10), Low(1-5), Even, Odd]. On your turn you will play one hidden panda face down, and one panda face up.  Your face up panda uses a special ability to do something -- steal a panda, change the Panda Law, or even gain bamboo!&#10;&#10;The Red Panda sits in the middle of the table, ready to award bamboo. If your turn starts and you can see four currently adorable pandas (by the Panda Law), scoring happens. You take the Red Panda card, and follow the instructions on the back. All hidden pandas are revealed, and everyone with at least two adorable pandas in play gets a bamboo. The player(s) with the most adorable pandas get a second bonus bamboo. Then, all adorable pandas are shuffled back into the deck (Other pandas remain). You choose a new Panda Law, and play continues. When someone gets to five bamboo, they win!&#10;&#10;Games last 5-15 minutes, and Adorable Pandaring can be played with 3-5 players.&#10;&#10;",

It should not be confused with Oware, which is also sometimes called &quot;Ayoayo&quot; when played in Nigeria. Related games are Andada in Eritrea and Endodoi in Tanzania.&#10;&#10;Ayoayo is played on a board of two rows, each consisting of six round pits that have a large store at either end. Each pit contains four seeds at the start.&#10;&#10;At his turn a player takes the contents of one of his smaller holes and distributes it, one by one, counterclockwise into the following holes, but not in the stores. If the last seed falls into a non-empty hole, its contents including the last distributed seed is continued to be distributed.&#10;&#10;The move ends when the last seed falls in an empty hole.&#10;&#10;If the last seed falls in an empty hole on the player's own side, the seeds in the opponent's hole directly across and the seed effecting the capture are captured and placed into the store. If the emptied hole contains twelve or more seeds, it is skipped.&#10;&#10;When the opponent has no seeds in his holes, he must get some seeds in the next move, if possible. Otherwise the game is over and the remaining seeds are captured by the player who moved last.&#10;&#10;The player who captured most counters wins the game.&#10;&#10;Description taken from Mancala World.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Melee in the Mines is a print-and-play microgame that pits two players against one another. The dwarves&rsquo; silver mine has cut into the tunnels of a monster lair, and now a band of adventurers is fighting for their lives in the narrow confines of the mine against a band of monsters. Each player starts with 7 of 18 characters (18 Monsters or 18 Adventurers). The winner is the party that drives the other from the mine!&#10;&#10;Only the first character in each party can use hand-to-hand combat. Other party members can use ranged weapons or special attacks -- provided they have a clear line-of-sight over their companions&rsquo; heads. In these tight quarters, jostling for position is important. It&rsquo;s great to have your troll at the head of your party, given his strength, but then no one behind him can see past him to use a ranged attack. If your halfling is at the front, everyone taller can fire over him, but he himself won&rsquo;t be doing much damage.&#10;&#10;Each turn you can either battle (roll 2 six-sided dice) or take an action (see below) and attack with 1 die. Each die roll is assigned to a character whose abilities match that roll &ndash; each card has die faces on it, with corresponding attacks: 1 = Rush, 2 = Strike, 3 = Panic, 4 = Fell, 5 = Do, 6 = Kill.&#10;&#10;You can download the 4-page PDF from the Files section. You will need two 6-sided dice.&#10;&#10;This game was created for the 2015 BGG Microgame Prototype Design Competition.&#10;&#10;",

One player is the attacker while the other player is the defender. Each player's ninja pieces show its movement, range, and attack properties. When two pieces battle, each player adds the attack number of their battling piece to the roll of two dice, with the highest total winning the battle. Eventually, the defender will either have prevented the attacker from stealing the treasure, or the attacker will make off with the treasure, winning the game.  It is suggested that two rounds are played, with players switching roles and comparing the points that they gained when they played the attacker in order to determine a winner.&#10;&#10;",

The goal is the first player to 4 bible studies. You gain a bible study by finding the Sheeplike one out in the territory or be the last player still in the round.&#10;&#10;Setup:  The territory consists of 9 cards (houses) grouped in 3 piles hiding where the Sheeplike and Do Not Call cards are.   Shuffle the Sheeplike, Do Not Call and 1 Not Interested cards and create 3 piles.  Then deal 2 more territory cards on top of the 3 piles.  Players are each dealt 1 card each from the publisher cards.&#10;&#10;The game consists of 2 stages:&#10;&#10;Door To Door: Players draw and play cards searching through the territory stacks for the Sheeplike one. There are 17 publisher cards that allow players to flip the cards in the territory and move cards around within the stacks. This allows for players to hide traps and uncover the Sheeplike card. If a Do Not Call is flipped without the protection of the Bible card, that player has to sit out of the current round. If the Sheeplike one is not found by the time that there is no more publisher cards to draw from then the next stage starts.&#10;&#10;Return Visit: Once all cards have been drawn from the publisher draw pile. All players turns over their one card in their hand.  Whoever has the highest value card, they get the first pick of where they think the Sheeplike card is at. Remember the players have had a few turns to deduce the most likely location of the Sheeplike one. So when the publisher pile is getting low, it is good to hold onto higher value cards.&#10;&#10;",

There's just one problem: due to a bureaucratic mishap, the rockets aren't scheduled to be assembled until next Tuesday.&#10;&#10;You and the other players are high-ranking scientists at the National Space Program, competing to put together the best rocket you possibly can in the final ten minutes before launch. Whoever builds the rocket that gets closest to space, without exploding or suffering a similar fatal catastrophe, wins the game and keeps their job.

During Construction, players will draft cards from the construction deck and add components to their control module, in order to build the best rocket they possibly can in the limited time available. During Launch, players will see how well they did, by using the components which make up their rocket to advance their pawn from the Earth to space (or as close to space as they can get).&#10;&#10;",

Players will take on the role of parasites and their respective hosts in an attempt to gain or steal the most points by the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The game is played with a deck of cards containing a set of colored host cards for each player numbered 2,3,4 and 5. The deck also contains special action cards, one for each player.&#10;&#10;Players will also receive four parasite tokens of their selected color valued 1,2,3 and 4. The players colored host cards and parasite tokens represent potential points.&#10;&#10;The game starts with one card turned face up next to the draw pile. Drawn cards will be placed next to this card. A new row will start after five cards have been drawn.&#10;&#10;On your turn players can (1) place a parasite on a host card, (2) move a parasite to an adjacent host or action card, (3) draw a card to place in play or (4) pass.&#10;&#10;Drawing a card will activate a scoring phase. All previous cards are then evaluated for scoring condition. Cards of your color without any parasite tokens score the full value for the player. Cards with parasites where the value of the parasites are of less than value that the host card it is on will score points for the owner of the parasite and card owner. EXAMPLE: A three green parasite on a five blue host card will score three points for green and two points for blue.&#10;&#10;Cards where the total of the parasites is equal to or more than the host card total, will NOT score for either player. Action cards allow players to perform a special action like move other players tokens or look through the deck.&#10;&#10;The game is over when all the cards have been drawn and placed into the play area. The player with the highest point after all the cards have been drawn is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

The player then turns a sand timer and if they can correctly answer the question in time they score points. Either way, play then passes to the next player.&#10;&#10;More difficult questions are worth more points and each player has a single Moriarty card and a Sherlock card which can each be used once per game to score in additional ways. A Moriarty card is used at the start of another players turn as a bet that they will not answer the question correctly (or in time). If the bet is correct, the Moriarty player earns the points for the question. A Sherlock card can be used on your own turn to make the question worth double the points. However, it must be played before reading the question!&#10;&#10;",

Each player starts with one surfer at the top edge of the tower.  A &quot;wave&quot; made of green goo is loaded into a &quot;regulator&quot; at the top of the tower, which dispenses the goo to pour down the tower at a preselected speed.  Players then race their surfers down the tower by rolling a die which controls movement.  They try to reach the bottom of the tower first while avoiding being engulfed by the goo and &quot;wiping out.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Like Bingo, in order to win, a player must complete a row of three across, down or diagonally.  Unlike Bingo, each player takes turns spinning a spinner marked with five letters. They must then find a picture that starts with the letter spun. Only the player spinning may mark his or her card.  The game comes with four separate sets of cards to cover the entire alphabet.&#10;&#10;",

Unlike warriors that got to fight and die in battle to be carried off to Valhalla, you were only an adviser and tactician who assisted by drawing upon the power of the Runes to help your fellow warriors in their battles.&#10;&#10;However, Freya smiles upon you and offers redemption to the V&ouml;lva who can prove their abilities.

Players must create gateways, starting in Helheim, and sequentially working their way up to Asgard.  By casting the runes, they will generate power to create those gateways and activate them.  However, this is not enough to gain entrance to Valhalla.  You must also gain enough valour by using the runes to overcome challenges, or to defeat your rival, by drawing upon the strength provided by the gateways.  When you have earned enough valour and opened all the gateways, only then will you be allowed entrance to Valhalla!&#10;&#10;GOAL&#10;The first player to have gateways in each of the 9 realms, open all their gateways and have 11 valour wins.&#10;&#10;",

An extension of scenario 1, as reinforcements from Sedgewick's Corps descends upon Ewell's left flank. Hay's Louisiana Tigers help stem the blue flood.&#10;3 Hill to the Attack! Two divisions of A.P. Hill's 3rd Corps rattles up the Orange Plank Road and attempts to cut Grant in half by capturing the Brock Road intersection. A single division, commanded by VIth Corps George Getty, stands in his way. Hancock's II corps arrives just in time to save the day. Or will he?&#10;&#10;May 6th Scenarios&#10;1 Lee to the Rear! Early in the morning of may 6th Hancock strikes Heth's and Wilcox's divisions of Hill's 3rd Corps. Both divisions have been strung out and exhausted from the previous days fighting. They expected Longstreet's early arrival, and so neglect to fortify their line. Hancock initially drives them almost handsomely, and nearly captures Lee's HQ at the Widow Tapp farm. The engagement witnesses one of the most dramatic moments of the war, when the Marble Man himself proposes to lead the Texas Brigade of Longstreet corps in a counter-charge.&#10;2 Like a Wet Blanket. Now fully arrived, Longstreet strikes the over-extended flank of Hancock's corps. In a swift and dramatic reversal it's now the Yankee's turn to run. Will Longstreet capture the ever important Brock Road intersection?&#10;3 Gordon's Assault. John B. Gordon, ever the thorn in Grant's side, jumps the VI corps and nearly shatters the Yankee's right. Only the coming of darkness brings his assault to an end.&#10;&#10;The Campaign Games&#10;These games implement Custom command rules simulating the problems of controlling armies over vast broken terrain. Lee struggles to coordinate his widely separated wings, while Grant whittles away the days, goading reluctant subordinates to action.&#10;1 The May 5th Mini-Campaign game.

Up to six players control the major dynasties of the era, fielding armies, navies, and engaging in diplomatic intrigue, bribery decide who will wear the crown of the Holy Roman Empire.&#10;&#10;The year is 1619. Matthias, emperor of Germany, has gone to his grave. A year-old rebellion in the imperial province of Bohemia had divided the empire along religious and political lines. Bohemian rebels have elected a minor German prince, Frederick, elector Palatine, as their king. Protestant princelings rally to Frederick, elevating his status to that of a rival to Em&shy;peror Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria, for the imperial throne. As mercenary armies are raised against Ferdinand, the Catholic King of Spain and Duke of Bavaria rally to his side. France and Sweden turn their attention to Germany in eager anticipation of the dismemberment of their great rival, the Holy Roman Empire.&#10;&#10;",

In Barnyard Legions you, the general, have been given a mission to keep the other Legions from ever completing their goal of lining up a proper battle line or two. Will you command the Sheep Legionnaires under the rule of Julius Sheepsar? Or will the hoof of Auroch the Red Boviking crush the Celtucky Chickens?&#10;&#10;How do you play? &#10;Each player takes their choice of Barnyard Legion and mixes some of their cards into a common deck. The rest of their cards are kept as their own deck. Each turn, players take 2-3 actions, attempting to complete a battle line of five cards from their Legion. To keep the game moving, every player draws a card from their deck at the start of each round, hoping to not run out of cards, causing elimination, before the battle has been won.&#10;&#10;What is unique about it?&#10;The game has built in subtleties that will appeal to gamers, while the unique decks and humorous tongue-in-cheek art make Barnyard Legions a great gateway game for players who are not familiar with more complicated card games. Families will be able to sit down and follow the very simple rules and start playing immediately.&#10;&#10;",

It consists of a series of matching cards, one side with a letter and word printed on it, and the other with a corresponding picture.  The cards have a puzzle piece edge, and each card only fits its pair.&#10;&#10;There are two possible ways to play.  One is called Match Out.  In this game, cards are placed face-down and each player draws an equal number.  The first player places the top tile on their stack face-up.  Each player in turn then turns up his or her top tile.  If it matches any of the turned-up tiles, the player matches them, puts them aside, and turns up the next tile in his or her stack.  This continues until no matches are made, and play passes to the next player.  The first player to eliminate his or her stack wins.&#10;&#10;In ABC Rummy, letter and picture tiles are places in separate piles.  Players take turns drawing from either stack until they all have four tiles in their hand.  If any players have matches, they may lay them down immediately.  Each player then draws a tile from either pile and tries to match it to tiles in their hand.  If there is a match, they are put aside and the player may draw again.  If not, the player may keep up to four tiles and must discard any others face-up in the middle of the table.  Further players may draw from either the piles or the face-up tiles, making as many matches as possible.  Play continues until one player has five pairs.&#10;&#10;",

Experienced players can involve themselves in the valorous abilities and tactics of Epic and still have a balanced fight against new players learning Heroic.&#10;&#10;Each realm has nine individual card stock figures mounted on a base. Movement and combat in the varied terrain hexes is fuelled by an Action Pool. Combat uses-twelve sided dice that can be modified with Fate Cards. The winner is either the Realm with the last ruler standing or who has filled up their Blood Cauldron up with the sanguine fluid of their enemies!&#10;&#10;The War of the Nine Realms is a tactical skirmish game for 2-4 players, aged 10 or above. Game time is 60 minutes and the complexity is 7 ( on a scale of 1-10).

In this Game, Angels and/or Demons are assigned the task to oversee the Souls and assist them on a final journey one way or the other. In some cases, multiple Angels or Demons are assigned. In these cases, they compete to see who can influence the souls better and win the favor of their father.&#10;&#10;Angels Ascend Souls to Heaven. Demons Descend Souls to Hell. Also, Souls may be influenced to move toward the light or away from the light. Some actions require or gain grace or cruelty. After each round, Pure Souls move toward the light and Corrupted Souls move away from the light.&#10;&#10;Souls vary in value depending on the Soul and if the player is an Angel or Demon. A player wins by gaining the most points after one of several Game Ending conditions are met. It is possible all players lose if Souls are not managed properly.&#10;&#10;",

The full game download is available on his website.&#10;&#10;From the rulebook:&#10;&#10;The Scourging of the North was a campaign of retaliation by the Alliance of western Men and Elves against the Goblins from the Northern Wastes. This was a war intended to break the Goblin army and scatter it forever.&#10;&#10;Aimed at the great Goblin citadel of Angmar, with the northern snows fast approaching, whoever controlled that foul fortress would be in a strong position to survive the winter intact and finish the campaign of annihilation in the spring. The Alliance came very close to seizing Angmar, but a rallying of Goblins from across the Northern Waste to its defenses overcame the forces of the West.&#10;&#10;Battle for Angmar is played on a map of the desolate Goblin lands where the 3-day battle was fought. It uses playing pieces that represent the military units that partici-pated in this campaign. Each player is a leader commanding an army of troops. The individual Alliance ground units represent approximately 250 Men or Elves and what was left of their equipment after the long march across the southern regions of Middle Earth. The Goblin units represent approximately 400 Goblin warriors each.&#10;&#10;General course of play:&#10;&#10;Players alternate turns moving units and attacking enemy units in order to achieve the victory condition of controlling the city of Angmar at the end of turn 7.&#10;&#10;",

It develops problem solving skills in a way that is accessible to preschoolers, enjoyable to kids, but is also challenging to parents.&#10;&#10;On each card is an animal species and on each side of the square are that animal's: Classification, Diet, Conservation Status (from the IUCN) and World Region. These will be used to match cards that are played in the game. Depending on the game style chosen, a player's cards may be face-down or held. Depending on the number of cards in the final version, it could range from at most 5 to 8 players.&#10;&#10;The challenge of each game style is to make connections. Only cards that have a link (a correct match) can be played off of another. When the game area begins to get larger it, playing cards may require more than one side to match. Every side of the card must match. In some games there are rewards for playing cards with 2, 3, or 4 connections (a double, triple or quadruple link).&#10;&#10;The goal of each game style is to play all of your cards first.&#10;&#10;",

Teams then have to swap pieces with other teams (always one for one, two for two etc) to collect all the pieces with the same picture. However, trading is done by shouting the number of pieces you want to swap. You only know how many pieces you are getting, not what picture is on them. Teams then have to assemble the pieces into a complete banana. Whichever team does this first wins.&#10;&#10;",

A two-mile wide asteroid will strike Earth at midnight, wiping out humanity&hellip; just like they predicted. You were one of the lucky ones to secure your spot in a bunker, ensuring your own survival. Some late-comers aren&rsquo;t so lucky, though. You need to determine who stays and who goes.&#10;&#10;There are rumors of cult members infiltrating and sabotaging bunkers to fulfill their doomsday prophecy. Choose wisely!&#10;&#10;In The End Is Nigh, players have twelve turns to weed out the cultists among the on-trial refugees. On your turn, you must question a refugee to learn more about them, inform your associates of your findings, and then cast your vote for exile. Beware though! Some of the refugees have effects that can interfere with your investigation, and after being questioned, refugees will remain &ldquo;exhausted&rdquo; for a turn, preventing the next player from questioning them.&#10;&#10;When the clock strikes 6, the refugee with the most exile markers is turned away from the bunker. Questioning then continues until 12, when the second refugee is cast out.  If even one cultist manages to makes it inside, humanity is doomed. Who will you vote for?&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Warband provides all the rules you need to bring great battles between fantasy armies to your tabletop.&#10;&#10;Using miniature figures and terrain, you can fight battles from the glorious sword and sorcery epics you've read about.  &#10;Miniatures are based on 10x5cm bases, allowing you to create miniature vignettes or dioramas for each unit.&#10;&#10;Warband is designed to be simple to learn and difficult to master, and so it uses a single consistent task resolution method throughout the rules.  Whether you&rsquo;re trying to get a unit of warriors to move, seeing how effective it&rsquo;s shooting or fighting is, or how well it has defended itself, you&rsquo;ll be using the same dice pool mechanism.  You determine the number of dice to roll and each result of 4+ is a success.  The more successes you roll, the better your units will do, and the more likely you are to win.  Simple!&#10;&#10;Of course fighting a good tactical battle, getting your units into advantageous situations, and making effective command decisions will mean you&rsquo;ll be far more likely to win.  Coming up with effective tactics for your chosen army to defeat your opponents is what will take you time to master.&#10;&#10;So with Warband&rsquo;s intuitive rules you&rsquo;ll be fighting the battle not the rulebook, and hopefully having a lot of fun into the bargain!&#10;&#10;You'll be able to decide which of the fantastic races you'd like to command and then construct your force from the lists provided.  &#10;Warband includes complete army lists for twelve armies, with abilities, options, spell lists, and descriptions including; &#10;Barbarian men, Dark elves, Dragon men, Eldritch vampires, Goblins, High elves, Hill dwarves, Lizardmen, Samurai apes, Taurians, Undead, and Wood elves.  Each army is balanced by being constructed from a fixed 500 point cost.  Powerful units cost more so are rarer.  A typical warband will have 10-12 units, representing an army of maybe 3000 warriors.&#10;&#10;Army composition and optional upgrades are highly flexible, allowing you to build the force that best fits your style of play.  If you'd like to command a horde of bison riding barbarians, rampaging minotaurs, skirmishing ghouls, or serried ranks of deadly elven archers then you'll find something to suit you in the Warband rules.  This flexibility means that you should be able to play with your favourite fantasy race in a way that suits your personal style and preferences, while your force still retains a unique and interesting character.&#10;&#10;",

Their plan is complex, their overall objective still a secret, but the dice have already been rolled and the battle lines drawn. The eastern forces have a new and deadly ally. The infamous Wani have returned from exile, contributing never-before-seen technology to seal their new pact of service with the Empire.&#10;&#10;To the north, the Federated States of America has responded with speed to the loss of its own vessels, both military and civilian. In a bid to counter the mysterious 'Ghost Ship' the chief scientists of this great nation have accelerated development of their own secret weapon - the Boston Class Submersible - and the American Admirals are eager to prove it in battle. Designed to engage and destroy even the most formidable enemy ships, the Boston Class comes armed with the latest advanced weaponry and a complement of Assault Subs.&#10;&#10;The scene is set for lethal conflict as two of the deadliest naval forces on the planet clash in the once calm waters off the coast of Brazil.&#10;&#10;Dare you take command in Operation Shadow Hunter?&#10;&#10;",

In this game, players try to collect as many treasures as they can while they try to avoid fighting with brigands and other ruffians.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, the 10 stacks (differed by color and number) of cards (with treasures and brigands) are formed in the middle of the table. Each player receives 2 or 3 characters.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, they have to choose one of the following two actions:&#10;1. Take one card from one of the stacks and place it face up in front of them.&#10;2. Send all previously gathered cards to the castle using one of their characters.&#10;&#10;Players try to gather as many cards as they can, but the more they have, the more risk they have to lose it all. What's more, action 2 can be performed only 2 or 3 times per game (each character can be sent once). The players also try to remember in which stack the bad cards were taken, because every stack contains the same set of cards.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all of the players have sent all their characters or when nobody has anything more to send and there are no cards to draw. Players now count up their treasure cards. The player with the highest score is the winner.&#10;&#10;There is also an advanced variant which players can choose to play with: It includes the 10 bonus point card, which is given at the end of the game to the player who gathered the most coins amongst their treasures. Also, when a player draws the appropriate card, they have to give it to another player, and then steal all the coins from that chosen player.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Pan tu nie sta&#197;&#130;! Demoludy is a reimplementation of a Reiner Knizia game Gem Dealer. This game is also a sequel to the game Pan tu nie sta&#197;&#130;! (which is a Polish version of Great Wall of China).&#10;&#10;The mechanics were wrapped into a theme of 70's and 80's in communist countries of eastern Europe. In this game players take a trip from Poland, travelling by popular in that time cars and try to collect a set of items bought in four (out of five) different countries. The countries presented in the game are: GDR (German Democratic Republic), Czechoslovakia, HPR (Hungarian People's Republic), Turkey and USSR (Union of Soviet Socialist Republics).&#10;&#10;Every round is an auction. The starting player takes one tile of a chosen color (country) and place it in the middle of the table. She then make a starting bid which has to contain at least one card of a matching color. The next player may present a higher bid or pass. After every bid or pass a player draws one new card from the deck and adds it to her hand. The player who already passed is omitted. The auction continues untill all but one player pass. The winner takes the tile, puts it in his car and starts a new round.&#10;&#10;The first player to collect a set of four tile in different colors is the winner.&#10;&#10;The game also features advanced rules. In this variant in order to win the players have to collect the four color set of tile with a value of at least 10. There are also action cards which can help to it's owner or mess up with other players' cards.&#10;&#10;Demoludy vs Gem Dealer - differences&#10;- In Gem Dealer starting player receives one card less than the others. Every player gets 5 cards at the beginning of Demoludy.&#10;- In Gem Dealer there is a rule that if you lose a bidding contest while using wild card 10, you lose one of your previously gathered gem. There is no such rule in Demoludy.&#10;- There is an advanced variant in Gem Dealer in which you have to gather 5 different gems, while in advanced variant of Demoludy you need 4 different items with a total value of 10 or more.&#10;- There are no action cards in Gem Dealer which are in Demoludy.&#10;- Demoludy also contains the expansion for Pan tu nie sta&#197;&#130;! (Great Wall of China): Bazar R&oacute;&#197;&#188;yckiego (which would be translated to: R&oacute;&#197;&#188;ycki's Bazaar)&#10;&#10;",

Cards can path off in any direction, limited only by your table space, but must match connecting symbols.  These symbols also grant one time special actions, some good, some bad.  No matter what one action you choose on your turn (draw, place, take track from back on line) the mine cart always moves one space further.  The color of the space it lands on also causes 'something' to happen, so careful as you lay your track, giving lots of choices...&#10;&#10;Players cooperatively lay track until the last track (last card on bottom of deck) is placed, however the dwarf with the most vp left in his hand of track is declared the master track builder and receives the promotion from his boss.&#10;&#10;This game is an entry for the geekway to the west design contest.

At the beginning of each game the battlefield is dynamically generated from a deck of key strategic locations -- from Round Top and the Devil's Den to Cemetery Hill and Seminary Ridge -- ensuring no two games will be the same.&#10;&#10;On their turns, players select a combat unit from their reserves and flip it onto the battlefield in an attempt to seize control of a location or capture enemy forces to gain victory points. Infantry and cavalry units are not only different shapes, each has distinct strengths -- capturing a location featuring High Ground with infantry allows the player to perform an artillery strike, while cavalry can capture enemy infantry forces and remain in field.&#10;&#10;Each strategic location has different values representing how difficult they were to control (units needed), and how valuable they were to each side's efforts (victory points). Combat units have varying levels of effectiveness, representing the makeup of their forces and the quality of their leadership.&#10;&#10;The first player to earn 10 Victory Points through control of key locations or captured enemy forces wins the game!&#10;&#10;",

Security forces were activated immediately and they arrested a suspicious young laborer near the area.&#10;&#10;Mycroft Holmes, at the service of the crown, was commissioned to investigate the relationship of the young laborer with anarchist groups. He thinks it will be an easy task that he can do from the comfort of his armchair in the Diogenes Club &mdash; until he is informed of disturbing news; his younger brother Sherlock Holmes, Consulting Detective, has been hired by the boy's parents to prove the innocence of his son, who believes to be a scapegoat of a dark conspiracy.&#10;&#10;For the first time, the brightest minds in London face each other. Was the young laborer involved in this terrible attack or he is just a scapegoat for a dark conspiracy?&#10;&#10;A game of Holmes: Sherlock &amp; Mycroft lasts seven turns (days of investigation). At the beginning of each day, famous characters extracted from the books of Arthur Conan Doyle appear in London.&#10;&#10;Each player has three action tokens that move from one character to another to use their special abilities, knowing that a player can never have two tokens on the same character. Therefore, a character must be freed before reuse. The abilities of each character allow them to obtain Evidence Cards or gain Investigation Tokens in multiple ways. The game has great replay value because it is not known whether a character with a specific ability will make their appearance on the board in the Day 1 or in the final Day 7. Each game is different!&#10;&#10;",

Players place plastic, disc-shaped sheep tokens onto little plastic catapults, which they use to launch the tokens into nets located on a stand erected on the center of the board. Each player moves their dragon marker forward by the number of points scored each shooting round. Double points are scored with the black sheep token, or by shooting a token into your own net (matched to your catapult color). The first person to get their dragon marker around the board first wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

The game is also a race against time as your opponent is building his own devilish contraption. When the time is up, both sides switch their maze boards and steer a ball through the opponent's maze as quickly as they can. Be the fastest in two out of three rounds to claim victory!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "What is Larger Than Life - Director's Cut?&#10;It&rsquo;s a game about the Pulps. That means Lost Worlds, intrepid Archaeologists, Cliffhangers, and more. The setting may be exotic, the villains particularly villainous, but in truth, it&rsquo;s all about the Story. Whether it&rsquo;s finding treasure, saving someone, or thwarting the villain, it all boils down to the Story.&#10;&#10;Larger Than Life &ndash; Directors Cut can be likened to an action movie where your Hero moves from Scene to Scene trying to succeed in his adventure. What needs to be done? How do you do it? Who&rsquo;s in peril? Who&rsquo;s behind all this? All these things and more are generated for you by the easy to use game mechanics. Inside Larger Than Life &ndash; Director&rsquo;s Cut you&rsquo;ll find:&#10;&#10;&#10;    A variety of characters for you to play with and against. Stars, Co-Stars, Love Interests, Femme Fatales, and of course, the villains &ndash; we call them the Big Bads.&#10;    Over 35 Attributes that you can mix and match to make your characters unique. &#10;    A system that allows your characters to increase in skills and abilities when they succeed, but force them into &ldquo;retirement&rdquo; when they fail.&#10;    An easy to use mechanic that will generate and solve Clues, during each Story, based on your characters abilities. Solve the Clues and you make it to the Final Scene.&#10;    Nine different villains to fight, from Mob Bosses to Cavemen, and everything in between. &#10;    Four different Locales to adventure in. From the back alleys of a large Metropolis, to the villages in a Lost World, your Hero can travel from place to place, all generated by the game mechanics.&#10;    Over fifty Professions to create Victims, Suspects, and People of Interest and enrich your Story.&#10;    Mechanics that generate hundreds of possible adventures, with no two ever being alike.&#10;    Playable solo, cooperatively, or head to head.&#10;&#10;&#10;Cover art is a reused image of the original painting &quot;Blood on My Doorstep&quot; by pulp artist Rafael de Soto.  The work was originally featured on the cover of the July 1949 issue of New Detective Magazine.&#10;&#10;",

Each player takes control of one of the five factions and every model has the potential to be a hero or a villain.  Even with a larger number of miniatures on the table the WWX rules have been designed to keep the play fast and dynamic.&#10;&#10;One of the most exciting parts of the Wild West Exodus game mechanic is the reusable influence pool. The influence pool will give players the option to gamble away a set amount of tokens in return for a reroll of the dice. Be careful what you gamble on because once the tokens are committed they are lost for that turn. The D10 system gives the game life and options that round out easily and allow for quick decision making.&#10;&#10;",

M'buddy SeaBass calls me &ldquo;Song-Froggy&rdquo;, and so can you's all, if'n ya like. I'm wit ya today to do some splainin' on dis here game ya got yer eyeballs on. Now, you're gonna need some scratch paper and a crayon to keep score, just so's ya know. The whole durn point of the game is to get you the most points, and the simplest of folks ought to be able earn at least some, jes' needs a little learnin' is all. What ya gotta do is get you some frogs, what might have the best sound together. Once you done that, you set them up as a band, and now nobody can be a copy-cat and go makin' a band wit dat same sound. It ain't hard, and I'm gunna be here every step to walk ya through it.&#10;&#10;Now, ya got two choices every time it's your turn; y'all can pick up a frog and maybe get you some points, or ya can set you up a band and get ye couple more points. The rulebook's the place to get filled in on the par-tic-u-lars, but we ain't in the rulebook right now, is we? (Y'all can go ahead and download dem right now.)&#10;&#10;So some of these froggies is 'specially talented, and don't need no backup in they band. You just give'm a washboard or a gutbucket, and they'll be bustin' out a tune in no time. Most frogs, though, they got specific idears on who it is they wanna play with. They'll tell ya, easy enough, just by checkin' out the background on the picture. W'chever frog you choose to lead your band, he's the one you need to mind on that. Check out dem der Action Shots for a peek at what ya got comin' to ya here.&#10;&#10;Game's simple enough, folks, but ya can get still get to strategizin' if'n you put yer mind to it. Uncle Cletus might ought like it on account of it being so simple, and ya know you mama gonna like it, cuz all dem cute lil' froggies. I 'spect you'll be pickin' dis'n up fore too long.&#10;&#10;",

Then, players will take turns playing a card to the timeline to counteract these 'bad' resources while gaining as much progress as possible.&#10;&#10;Each player has a hand of general action cards and starts the game with 3 powerful character-specific actions. Each action card adds or subtracts one or several resources, as well as sometimes giving the player access to powerful abilities such as looking through the action or event decks.&#10;&#10;The resources are kept track of on shared boards. Each minute of the timeline has a threat track to keep track of the amount of threat you have minute-to-minute. Additionally, there is a progress and fatigue mat that is used in combination with specific tokens to keep track of your current totals for those resources.&#10;&#10;If you are able to accumulate enough progress while keeping threat and fatigue low enough before you run out of space on the timeline or the event deck runs out, then you win.&#10;&#10;",

This game focuses on the small unit tactics used by fire teams and infantry squads emphasizing their differing weapons, training and determination. The unique mechanics in WWII Assault make it an intense action oriented game in which the battle can change in an instant.&#10;&#10;Each player typically controls a squad or several squads of infantry. Each figure in WWII Assault is individually based and represents a single soldier that can perform independent actions from the rest of the squad.&#10;&#10;WWII Assault is designed to allow players to recreate any small scale engagements from the first battles in Poland, throughout the European Theatre and into the last days of Berlin.&#10;&#10;The WWII Assault Field Kit is a digest sized tri-fold rules booklet with an interior pocket that is packed with all the rules, weapon sheets, squad cards and more that you need to get started playing the game. There are two scenarios included in the Field Kit and more will be added to our website along with squad creation rules.&#10;&#10;Players may use any scale of figures (suggested figure sizes range from: 15mm to 54mm) in their collection.&#10;&#10;With the basic rules kept to under 5 pages, WWII Assault is quick and easy to learn and yet it offers:&#10;&#10;&#10;    A unique card-based initiative system that changes each turn.&#10;    A game system where higher skilled soldiers fire better than lesser skilled soldiers.&#10;    A game system where the differences between weapons not only exist but they are integral to the game.&#10;    A game system that can be realistically and enjoyably used in any squad level scenario from WWII.&#10;    A game system that tracks multiple levels of wounds, morale, suppression and other unit impairing conditions on the battlefield.&#10;&#10;&#10;All this and more in an intense action oriented game where a single soldier can bring you total victory or drive you towards defeat.&#10;&#10;",

Since each of the areas contain differing amounts of food and wood, players must learn to recognize and adapt to their opponent's strategies because if two players are both in the same area, they must share the resources. Players continue to move along their supply route, using the marketplace to trade tools and food as well as recruit workers.&#10;&#10;The players have to decide how their wood will be transported to their lumberyards (by raft, by foot, or in the winter by sled), if the wood should be dried or be processed immediately, and when the wood should be sold. The player must also think about new acquisitions (such as saws, sleds and pasture land) and fulfill orders to sell the wood. Because in the end, this business is all about money, and whoever can make the most wins.&#10;&#10;",

This face-up set of Spy Gear cards can score points for that spy, but it can also elude to that spy's true identity! Once you think you know the Identity of another spy, you can make a guess to potentially unmask that spy...but look out, unmasked spies can fight back!&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each round, players are given a secret Spy ID card that lets that player know which five Spy Gear cards (of 12 different Spy Gear cards) they are able to score with.&#10;&#10;Each turn, spies draw a card from the Spy Gear deck, then play a card to their face-up Spy Set. Once they have added a new card to their Spy set, they must do one of three things:&#10;&bull; Swap any card in their Spy Set for any card in another's set.&#10;&bull; Destroy one of their own Spy Gear cards from their set to use it's ability. &#10;(This can be asking other spies questions, or increasing their own score.)&#10;&bull; Guess the Identity of another spy. &#10;(Add points to your total for correct guesses, and subtract points if incorrect)&#10;&#10;If you are incorrect with your guess, you do not eliminate yourself.&#10;If you are discovered, you are considered &quot;unmasked&quot;.&#10;&#10;Unlike many other elimination games, Masters of disguise doesn't REALLY eliminate players. unmasked spies can still swap spy gear cards around the table, and make guesses on other spies, so &quot;eliminated&quot; spies are still engaged throughout each round.&#10;&#10;The player with the least total points between rounds will be the first player of each new round.&#10;&#10;Rounds end when there is one undiscovered spy remaining. The player with the most points at the end of three rounds is the Master of Disguise!&#10;&#10;",

The team that gains more points at the end wins.&#10;&#10;Publisher summary:&#10;&#228;&#184;&#141;&#229;&#157;&#135;&#231;&#173;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#173;&#163;&#228;&#189;&#147;&#233;&#154;&#160;&#229;&#140;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#184;&#130;&#233;&#149;&#183;&#233;&#129;&#184;&#230;&#140;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#179;&#230;&#177;&#154;&#232;&#129;&#183;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#229;&#133;&#168;&#228;&#189;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#181;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#185;(Resistance)&#227;&#129;&#171;&#232;&#191;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#138;&#149;&#231;&#165;&#168;&#229;&#175;&#190;&#232;&#177;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#231;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#230;&#149;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#228;&#184;&#141;&#230;&#152;&#142;&#231;&#162;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#228;&#186;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#229;&#164;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#168;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#187;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Evil has returned to the land. The malevolent Yaoguai, a demon of great power, has escaped its celestial prison. Returned to the world, it sets its sights on its true enemy: Sun Wukong, the immortal Monkey King.&#10;&#10;As the Yaoguai makes its way down the mountain, Xuanzang spurs his disciple to action:  he must set a trap for the fiend and seal it back within its prison, for if the beast can manage to defeat and consume the Monkey King, then it will steal immortality for itself.  The Monkey King gathers the fiercest heroes and monks and awaits the demon at the foot of the mountain.  He installs seers of great power to seek for the beast, and surrounds the camp with guardians to protect both him and his master.  As Xuanzang prays to the goddess Guanyin for guidance and blesses powerful talismans with the mantra to bind the creature back to its mountain, the Monkey King&rsquo;s generals sit and wait in anticipation of the coming conflict.&#10;&#10;But, the Yaoguai brings a corruption that runs deep.  It whispers dark, honey-sweet words of glory and promised enlightenment to those in the Monkey King&rsquo;s camp, threatening to turn many who reside there into traitors.  In its wake follows the shapeshifting Mo Shadow, seeking the flesh of Xuanzang to achieve its own sinister purpose.  Fox spirits emerge to dart about, bringing their assistance to those they choose.  And deep beneath the waters of a nearby lake, unbeknownst to all, a fish begins to quiver and sprout wings, and should this Peng burst forth, it will force an end to any fighting with its brilliance.&#10;&#10;You are the Monkey King&rsquo;s generals.  Will you find and seal away the Yaoguai, or turn the power of the Talisman on the Monkey King himself?  Will you weed out the traitors in the camp, or will you be the traitor, sending your men to capture their allies and make way for the demon?  The deeds of this day will be forever recorded and you shall live within them, with either honor or infamy.  The choices are yours.&#10;&#10;In Yaoguai, take the role of one of the Monkey King's generals.  Players draw and play cards from hand, simulating the conflict between the various entities in the game.  The goal is to capture the correct combination of cards, or the highest overall point value, while attempting to maintain some degree of secrecy.&#10;&#10;Yaoguai is a game for 2-4 people that is playable in 5-10 minutes, and is highly influenced by Chinese literature and mythology.&#10;&#10;This game was a finalist in the Geekway to the West and BGG Micro game contest!  Thank you to all who voted for it.  It was a wonderful experience and I learned a lot.  -Eric&#10;&#10;",

Well the fight back starts here! Some will fall in the upcoming battle, but if you bring together the ultimate Geek Army, you will take over the world (game night). Come the GEEK REVOLUTION!&#10;&#10;This game has been designed to be played at a game night or convention. Your job is to build the best geek army you can. Each player starts with a hand of cards. On your turn you must do the following actions in order. Draw or Pick Back, then Place and finally Discard. Do each action only once then play passes to player to your left. This continues until a player &ldquo;Goes Out&rdquo; by having no cards in there hand.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game calculate your score by adding the value of each set in your army together (the cards face up in front of you).&#10;Then minus the value of any sets you have left in your hand. Each of the 10 sets of Geek Cards, have a value based on the number of them you have collected.&#10;&#10;The large number indicates how many points in total a set of this type of Geek is worth. The twist is that each set does not necessarily become worth more with the more of that type you have.&#10;&#10;The player who wins the game gets to use their new geek powers (meta game effects like picking who makes drinks, or what game the group plays next.) You might want to play again just so you don't have to make the drinks for the rest of the event.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "User Summary:&#10;&#10;Princess Escort is a game of cooperation and betrayal. As the Escort Army, it is the players' duty to keep the princess secure on her way to a castle. During their travels, they have to cooperate to deal with several monsters attacking them.&#10;&#10;To make matters worse, one or two of the players are the Rebels who secretly help the monsters and try to harm the princess. The Escort Army must also protect her from the Rebels.&#10;&#10;Player actions are performed by secret voting, so even if the princess was harmed, the players don't know who did it. Players should deduce and discuss to identify who the Rebels are.&#10;After the 7-day travel, if the princess arrives at the castle alive, the Escort Army wins.&#10;&#10;User

After a long period of time, the fighting never ceased, and would repeat itself time after time. Soon enough, the war itself would involve the people living in Valhalla.&#10;&#10;The Gods and Demons would then develop techniques to summon and reincarnate strong, radiant souls, into battlers and soldiers to aid them in their cause.&#10;&#10;A whisper was heard... &quot;In exchange for your soul, I shall bestow upon you power unimaginable...&quot; In order to pave a new path to a brighter future, people gathered, and made pacts (Judgement) that would grant them new powers.&#10;&#10;Those who fight for their own beliefs, those who fight for the Gods, those who fight against the Gods, their spirit drives them into battle, and the battle has just begun.&#10;&#10;Game Play&#10;Players select a Ruler, which represents them in the game, and build a deck of cards around this ruler.  You also have a separate deck of 10-20 Magic Stone cards.&#10;&#10;During your turn you draw cards from your deck and play different types of cards to the field of play, interacting with your and your opponent's cards:&#10;&#10;    Magic Stones: Cards that produce Will which you use to pay the cost of other cards.&#10;    Resonators: Creatures you summon to help you in battle to defeat your opponent.&#10;    Spells:  They allow a player to support their Resonators with various effects, or hinder their opponent's Resonators.&#10;    Additions: Enchantments or Enhancements to augment their own Resonators or weaken opposing Resonators.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Objective of the Game:&#10;1. Lower the opponent players life from 4000 to 0 by attacking them. &#10;2. You also win if the opponent can't draw a card for the compulsory draw in the Draw Phase.&#10;&#10;",

Obtained cards go into your personal collection, and some of these cards provide (or make you lose) reputation points. If you focus too much on one type of shop, your customers will be dissatisfied and your opponent will gain points instead of you!&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, players score points based on who holds majorities in which shops. Holding a majority by only a few cards earns points for you, but from a certain point on, that majority provides points for your opponent instead! Whoever collects the most points from majorities and reputation points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Local merchants have had a run on the components you need.&#10;&#10;Cast the ritual is a 2-5 player card game where each player takes on the role of a different style of magic-user. The players work through the 3 nights that coincide with the stellar alignment. Each night they struggle to acquire the components they need (by collecting cards) in order to be the first to perform the ritual and harness the energy of the alignment.&#10;&#10;Do you have what it takes to be the first to cast the spell? Will you steal, attack, and pick through the trash to get what you need?

        "description": "In Pirates &amp; Privateers, Players take on the roles of Merchant Ship Captains in search of riches, plunder &amp; adventure during the Golden Age of Piracy (1660-1720). In order to profit and survive in the dangerous occupation as a Ship&rsquo;s Captain, they must use their skills and wiles, as well as, their fighting abilities. Player Captains may enter service with a Nation&rsquo;s Government as a Privateer, charged with capturing and sinking enemy ships and plundering enemy towns. Of course, one man&rsquo;s Privateer is another man&rsquo;s Pirate. If you engage in any hostile acts against a Nation&rsquo;s Ships or Towns, you will be considered a Pirate to that Nation and will be pursued until brought to justice.&#10;&#10;Ojective&#10;The objective of Pirates &amp; Privateers is for the Players to accumulate the most Gold after 12 Rounds. For a longer game play 16 Rounds; for a shorter game, play 8 Rounds. If your Player Captain is killed you may create another one and start with half the Gold (round down) of your previous Captain.&#10;&#10;Features&#10;Pirates &amp; Privateers features many colorful counters of ships, pirates, officers, crew, and native forces. The game includes rules for Trading and Commerce, Special Missions, Naval and Land Combat, Port Raiding, Buried Treasure and Duels.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Where's Wally is a bright and colourful memory card game featuring the elusive Wally, Wenda, Woof and Wizard Whitebeard. The aim of the game is to collect the most matching pairs by remembering where the cards are located once turned upside down but watch out for the mischievous Odlow, he's out to mess things up! Place all the cards facing down on a table or floor so that no card is touching another. The youngest player goes first by turning over 2 cards at random. If they match identically, ie 2 satchels, that player takes them and may then turn over 2 more cards. If the pairs don't match, they are turned face down again and the next player continues in the same way. If any player turns over an ODLAW card that player must shout ODLAW!, take the ODLAW card, then shuffle all the remaining cards in play so that no one can remember the position of any cards. The player who collects the most matching pairs wins!&#10;&#10;This memory game contains 54 Jumbo cards with easy rules for even the youngest of players. The game helps children with memory skills and learning how to take turns, along with developing the ability to play together. The game is for 1 or more players and suitable for children 3 years and up.&#10;&#10;",

Nearly 90% of the world&rsquo;s population was eliminated, driving the survivors to band together into loose communities and tribes.&#10;&#10;In Arctic Scavengers, you are the leader of a small tribe of survivors. Resources, tools, medicine, and mercenaries are all in scarce supply. You and your tribe are pitted against up to four other tribes in a fight for survival. Build up your tribe, skirmish against other players head-to-head, or even bluff your way to victory. The player with the largest tribe at the end of the game is declared the winner!&#10;&#10;As the competing tribes develop and grow, headquarters are established for each tribe thanks to the components in the included HQ expansion. This base camp consists of a Tribal Leader (complete with special abilities) and the potential to construct buildings that can be used strategically during game play. Additionally, the game introduces alternative victory paths, new mercenaries, new tools, and the addition of the &quot;engineering schematics&quot; pile.&#10;&#10;As the tribes evolve further and struggle for dominance, information becomes the most valuable currency. In the new world mapped out in the Recon, deception reigns, leading to a need for reconnaissance. This expansion adds new tribe leader roles, new mercenaries, new equipment, and new levels of player interaction (i.e., new ways to make your opponents feel pain).&#10;&#10;Arctic Scavengers: Base Game+HQ+Recon comes with a plastic insert to organize all your cards for ease in play setup.&#10;&#10;",

The task of each player is to push as many balls of a certain color in his corner of the pool.

After moving, the dice is rolled again, and player don't move figurines, but it can push off the ball forward from the figurine that is next to ball for the number rolled on dice. On that way, players try to score by pushing the ball into goal.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "A century ago, the true measure of wits was determined by feats of engineering. In &ldquo;Bridges to Nowhere&rdquo;, you are attempting to outwit your opponent and construct the most magnificent bridge. Will you plan for a sturdy long bridge, or maybe take a risk with a shorter multilevel bridge where your points can soar as you reach for great heights? Whatever you do, don't forget to keep an eye on your opponent or you may just hand them the victory.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Bridges to Nowhere&rdquo; is a 10-minute, 2-player micro game of strategic card drafting and bridge building. In 4 quick rounds, Players take turns drafting &quot;bridge cards&quot; which they will use to attach to larger &quot;pillar cards&quot; creating a unique Bridge tableau in front of them. At the end of 4 rounds, the Player whose bridge scores them the most points wins!&#10;&#10;No one ever said building a bridge was easy though! The challenge and fun of Bridges to Nowhere is found in trying to plan and build within the very particular guidelines of the game. There are three different types of bridge cards (Truss/Cable/Suspension) and they may never be mixed together in the same bridge. Not only that, each bridge card has a numeric point value listed at the bottom along with two symbols, one on each side. Two cards with the same bridge number can never be placed side by side, AND a single line of adjacent bridge cards can only ascend and/or descend numerically once in a single bridge segment.&#10;&#10;The Pillar cards are what you'll need to frame your bridge segments and possibly lay a foundation for a double or even TRIPLE decker bridge(if you've got the nerve). Be careful though, your Pillar cards are a strategic resource. If you don't play them just right you may end up with only a partially finished bridge, and that will cost you!&#10;&#10;Oh, but don't forget those symbols! If you can match two of the same symbols side by side in a bridge segment you'll reap big point bonuses. Another way to gain bonuses in the game is by completing Contract cards. These give both players a very specific set of bridge construction goals to try and reach in order to gain a medium or large point boost to their total score.&#10;&#10;Bridges to Nowhere is a fun and engaging game that plays as beautifully as it looks. With elegant gameplay that challenges players to keep their wits about them at every draw of a card, Bridges to Nowhere brings fun to the table again and again.&#10;&#10;",
