        "description": "This edition of Puerto Rico contains 14 additional buildings, previously released as Puerto Rico: Expansion I &#226;&#128;&#147; New Buildings.&#10;&#10;&#10;In Puerto Rico players assume the roles of colonial governors on the island of Puerto Rico. The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings.&#10;&#10;Each player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons.&#10;&#10;The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists.&#10;&#10;During each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as &quot;Trader&quot; or &quot;Builder&quot;). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player that selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so - for example, choosing the &quot;Builder&quot; role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.&#10;&#10;Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanic, where a &quot;governor&quot; token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action.&#10;&#10;Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned &quot;large buildings.&quot; Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.&#10;&#10;The new buildings are: Aqueduct, Forest House, Black Market, Storehouse, Guesthouse, Church, Trading Post, Small Wharf, Lighthouse, Library, Speciality Factory, Union Hall, Cloister, and Statue.&#10;&#10;",

But rough seas mean that a little luck goes a long way.&#10;&#10;Cannons do the greatest damage, that is when their powder isn&rsquo;t wet or they don&rsquo;t miss. But cannons take long to load and you&rsquo;ll be able to do more attacks by tossing hand mortars, throwing dirks, or firing flintlock pistols.&#10;&#10;But those aren&rsquo;t the only tricks these pirate captains have! Summon a lost pirate from the depths of Davy Jones&rsquo; Locker or even persuade an enemy pirate to join your crew!&#10;&#10;And, even in the heat of battle, fate can smile down upon this lowly lot and uncover treasure! No pirate can resist treasure &ndash; especially if it contains voodoo that helps them fight!&#10;&#10;Once you destroy the pirate enemy, you&rsquo;ve won! Or have you?&#10;&#10;The Pirate Ghost gives one last chance and can be a formidable opponent!&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;&#10;Aye, a sworn pirate enemy! Destroy their crew or sink their galleon to win.&#10;&#10;Pick your color and roll dice, higher goes first.&#10;&#10;Place your pirates on your ship and the matching damage token on your ship's damage counter.&#10;&#10;Place the gold cube and Pirate Ghost between the ships.&#10;&#10;Shuffle and deal 5 cards face down to each player.&#10;&#10;Place remaining deck face down.&#10;&#10;1. On your turn discard and draw up to 2 cards, if desired.&#10;&#10;2. Play a matching pair and roll the dice. If total matches any of the card's bottom numbers, it wins!&#10;&#10;a. Knife, pistol, bomb, or cannon - Take an opponent&rsquo;s pirate and place it beside your ship as a lost pirate.&#10;&#10;Cannon hits are also counted with damage cube. Four cannon hits, your galleon sinks, and you lose the game.&#10;&#10;b. Desertion - An opponent's pirate becomes a pirate on your ship.&#10;&#10;c. Davy Jones' Locker - Raise any lost pirate and place on your ship.&#10;&#10;Doubloons are wild and may be used to complete a pair.&#10;&#10;If needed, shuffle discarded cards to continue.&#10;&#10;Top right number is the total number of that card in the deck and its chances of success - !!! best, !! fair, ! least&#10;&#10;Pirate Ghost!&#10;&#10;First one to lose their crew places the Pirate Ghost on their ship and discards 2 cards.&#10;&#10;Pirate Ghost plays with only 3 cards unless they have the gold.&#10;&#10;Pirate Ghost is always the last lost if you gain crew.&#10;&#10;Dice Doubles!&#10;&#10;Place gold on your ship and play with an extra card!&#10;&#10;If the other player rolls a double, they take your gold and an extra card, and you lose your extra card.&#10;&#10;Game interrupted early?&#10;&#10;Each standing pirate on your ship is 2 victory points, lost pirates you&rsquo;ve claimed are 1 point each and 1 point for the gold.&#10;&#10;Most victory points win!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Each player is dealt 8 cards and the remaining card are placed on the desk face-down to form a draw pile. &#10;The first player picks up a card from the draw pile and determines if it helps him in constructing his &quot;meal&quot; with the cards that he has, he then keeps the card and discards one...&#10;A meal is formed with 5 food cards: veggie + fruit + &quot;protein&quot; or meat card + juice or &quot;drink&quot; card + bread or &quot;carb&quot; card.&#10;&#10;After a player discards, play moves to the next person going clockwise...&#10;&#10;While constructing a meal, the player can substitute one card with the Q card. However, a veggie card can't be substituted as veggies make integral part of a healthy meal :)&#10;&#10;Once you've constructed a meal, put the meal on the desk for everyone to see. If you've used a Q card to substitute a food card (let's say your meal doesn't have a Fruit card and you've used a Q card to replace it), another player can insert a Fruit card on your meal as process of gradually discarding his cards...&#10;&#10;Aside from this function of substitution, Q card can be used: a) to neutralize a junk card that has been used to destroy a meal. &#10;b) with a Q card you can ask (during your turn) another player (whose turn is after you) to show you a random card from the ones that he is holding (you don't get to see the card before picking it) and you can decide 1) to keep the card for you and put your Q card on the discard pile OR 2) you can decide not to take the card from the other player and keep your Q card.&#10;&#10;Junk card: the only function of this card is to destroy a healthy meal. There's nothing healthy about junk food. Players can discard this card by using it to destroy someone else's meal. All you need to do is place a junk card next to a meal...&#10;The only way to neutralize a junk card is to put a put a Q card after it...Ex: if you have 3 cards in hand and you've already created a meal, and someone places a junk card on your meal, you can neutralize that junk card by placing a Q card on it (if you have one or are lucky to draw one)&#10;&#10;Unlike most other card games, Qetchup doesn't require you to always draw a card and discard one during your turn. While this is certainly an option for an intuitive game play, you can simply discard a card by using one of it's functions. Ex: by placing a junk card to mess up someone's meal OR using a food card to add to a meal where Q card has been used to substitute it( without having to pick another card from the draw pile).&#10;&#10;If you have a Restart card, you can use it to make any other player restart their game from scratch by choosing a fresh set of 8 cards (that even if he's constructed a meal | his entire meal and discard pile are then shuffled back in with the existing draw pile to form a new draw pile from which he gets 8 new cards) Restart card goes back in the discard pile.&#10;&#10;",

It is time for elves, knights, and dwarves to tremble; a time for orcs to have unhygienic habits; a time for arrogant wizards to be put in their place; a time to write your epic tale. Do well and minstrels will sing about your deeds for generations. Do badly, and you will not even have your name scrawled on the privy wall. It is time for your mighty deeds to be chronicled on your Dragonscroll.&quot;&#10;&#10;In Dragonscroll, players take on the role of young dragons, each trying to become the most infamous in the land. Each player has a number of Dragonscroll cards, containing tasks to increase their renown and add to their story.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player draws and places a tile, which is added to the known world. These tiles may reveal enemies, such as wizards, elves and orcs; villages; or even lost royalty, optimistically eager for a lift home. The player then flies to a new location before raining fireballs down on any unsuspecting foes, using the flaming tower of death to determine where they land. At any point during his turn, he also has one bonus action, chosen from one of three double-sided cards. After choosing a bonus, the card is turned over, showing a different bonus action. A player may also eat three creatures to increase the number of fireballs he shoots.&#10;&#10;If a dragon manages to complete a task from one of his Dragonscroll cards, he may add it to his story. The dragon with the most illustrious story at the end of the game wins, and his tale will be recorded as Dragonscroll.&#10;&#10;Dragonscroll includes four dragon models and five buildings as the trademark large-scale Fragor components, in addition to wooden fireballs, wizard meeples, goat meeples, 64 large terrain tiles, 60 cards, and &quot;a fireball flaming tower of death&quot;, dubbed the &quot;Ball-ROG&quot; by co-designer Gordon Lamont.&#10;&#10;",

The two players each get sets of characters (fighters, thieves, and mages) of specified levels and run them through short adventures. The characters may have to confront some monsters and traps, but primarily they fight each other while trying to complete the scenario objectives.&#10;&#10;One twist in this game is that each player has their own copy of the map for the scenario being played and cannot see the opponent's map, so the game is played double-blind. A game master is required to mediate; the GM tells each player when they can see the opposing characters. (The GM may also do other things to spice up the game at their discretion.)&#10;&#10;Another twist is that the scenario maps are 3D - the game comes with many sheets of cardboard which can be cut apart to make floors, walls, and doors. It also comes with stand-up cardboard figures for the characters and a large number of item and spell cards.&#10;&#10;",

Once you have finished traveling the galaxy by going through the environment deck, the most successful player wins!&#10;&#10;Stars, Inc. is a 2-4 player light worker placement and resource management game where each player controls an alien race that has developed the technology to collapse giant gas clouds out in space to form stars. This has proven easier than making cold fusion efficient, and so this is the best way to harvest elements and resources needed to create planets. The game ends when players have toured the galaxy by passing through different environments, and points are scored throughout the game by having gas giant planets, white dwarfs, and space diamonds!&#10;&#10;The game board is based on a graph in astrophysics called the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram, and players have to plan their strategy of what types of stars to form: red dwarfs, sun-like stars, or blue giants: blue giants are more expensive, but they end their lives as supernovae and provide iron; sun-like stars evolve into white dwarfs; and red dwarfs are cheap to make and live nice, long lives as excellent planet hosts.&#10;&#10;",

In Cute Pixel Art!&#10;&#10;In Super Mini Adventure, players lead parties of powerful heroes and delve deep into the dungeons to slay foul monsters, all in the name of honor, glory, and shinning loot! But wait! For the biggest danger comes not from the monsters, but your fellow adventures! Watch out for their back-stabs and sabotages, as everyone frantically competes to slay the monsters and claim the prizes. Let the slaying begin!&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to earn Coins by defeating Monsters. Players do this by forming up to two adventuring parties of Heroes, assigning 1 Champion and 1 Companion role to each. Players then attempt to defeat the monsters by matching up to their stats (STR, MAG, and DEX), all the while playing different Hero cards and utilizing abilities to block other players from making the kill. At the end, when all the Monsters are defeated, the most courageous (and cunning) player with the most Coins wins.&#10;&#10;&#10;Super Mini Adventure is a Take That! style card game. Players play out combinations of different Hero cards to defeat monsters, while utilizing the different abilities on those cards to gain the upper hand. Construct combos and chain abilities, to set yourself up not only for the kill, but also to block and prevent your opponent from doing the same. Simple to learn, but with deep layers of strategies that will have you coming back for more!&#10;&#10;",

The resource roundel is used to control the availability of resources to the players and also to establish which player is in control of the game at any given time.&#10;&#10;Each player is managing one or two IT services, where each service relies upon one application and several technical services (represented in the Stabil-IT matrix).&#10;&#10;Over the course of six rounds, each player performs actions to improve the confidence in their IT services and to life-cycle them to an updated version. Each action takes one or more resources which can be technical specialists, application specialists or analysts/test specialist.&#10;At certain points in the game, stress tests are carried out to find the weakest point in the matrix which leads to a loss of confidence at that point. If there is no confidence to lose, an incident occurs.&#10;&#10;Solving an incident may result in gaining permanent or temporary knowledge which you can use to reduce the resources needed for your actions or retained to give points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;",

Any player can take pick it up if he can swap it with the represented letter.&#10;&#10;The Points are calculate when one player have no cards on his hands; He gets 0 points and the other players count the value on the cards they have on their hands. Then the next round can start.&#10;If a player gets 100+ points he is out of the game. The game continues untill only one player is active.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Orcs Orcs Orcs is a game for two to four players that combines two excellent game mechanics that have not been paired before (deck building and tower defense) and has players casting spells, squashing orcs and rolling up the score in the Orc Squash Tournament.&#10;&#10;The mages start the game on top of the tower in the middle of the battlefield. The battlefield consists of six lanes, each with three sectors, radiating out from the tower. On these lanes, the orcish hordes will try to charge all the way towards the tower. Your job is to defeat them before they can reach you.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each game round players draw a fate card, which will determine which category of creatures will advance one sector towards the tower and sometimes implement a nasty rule change for that particular game round. There are three categories of orcs which differ in strength and special abilities that are conveyed to a player once an orc is defeated.&#10;&#10;The game ends when you run out of orcs on one of the four lanes. During the final scoring, players count up their defeated orcs and multiply them by the number on the creature counter, get points for each support spell learned and subtract points for each poison card in their deck. Whoever has the most points will be declared &quot;Master Mage&quot;!&#10;&#10;",

Drawn from diverse backgrounds, some are explorers, others are scholars, but all the ladies and gentlemen are drawn together by one thing &ndash; the occult!&#10;&#10;Their curiosity and thirst for knowledge of the arcane arts draws them towards it like so many moths to an open flame. In their plush and exclusive London Club they meet to discuss their latest exploits - the artifacts uncovered, the diabolical schemes foiled, and the supernatural terrors they have hunted.&#10;&#10;The unofficial motto of the club is &rsquo;Possession is 9/10th of the lore.&rsquo; An offhand joke maybe, yet many say it perfectly captures the club&rsquo;s healthy spirit of competition and the very real danger its members face every time they set out on another paranormal investigation.&#10;&#10;In Ghost Hunter players take on the role of  new Infernal Club members and set out on a quest to the notorious Blackmoor House to compete against their fellow hunters to capture as many of the unholy spirits that haunt it as possible without succumbing to the terror and ending up haunted for life!&#10;&#10;Ghost Hunter is a card game for 2 &ndash; 7 players that should last between 10-30 minutes. Players take it in turns to lay higher and higher cards on a central stack. If a player can&rsquo;t lay an equal or higher card on the stack then they have to pick it up. If a player manages to lay a group of 3 cards at once then they get to capture the stack. Plenty of the cards come with special rules that you can manipulate to turn the game your way. The first player to play all of their cards ends the game and then players count up the scores of all of the cards that they captured minus all of the cards that they didn&rsquo;t manage to get rid of. The player with the highest score wins the game.&#10;&#10;The rules are simple but the strategies can be complex. Skill and luck play their parts in equal measure in this short but engaging card game. It pays to get rid of your cards and be the Ghost Hunter who ends the game but victory is never assured until the final scores are counted.&#10;&#10;",

The Majority Complete Edition combines two games previously available only in Japan, The Majority and The Majority 2.&#10;&#10;The Majority:&#10;The Majority is playable with 3 or 4 players. In a 4 player game, the game is played in teams of 2, forming a 2 versus 2 game. In this game, each player will be playing a card from his or her hand to form political parties. Cards have different special abilities as well as strengths in the political party. Players will be using these cards to form a strong and powerful party. However, in this game, having the strongest party won't make you the most money. Instead, being the second most powerful party will grant you more money! Remember though, that getting some money is always better than getting nothing. You must carefully coordinate your plays with your partner so that you and your partner will end up with the most and second most powerful party!&#10;&#10;In a 3 player game, the game is played almost identically. However, you will not have a partner, so it will be a 3 person free for all. You will need to play cleverly to ensure that you will end up with more money than your opponents!&#10;&#10;The Majority 2:&#10;The Majority 2 is playable only with 2 players. In this game, a player's goal is to create more political factions with higher authorities than his or her opponent. Board members are the various residents of the pandemonium, including Witches, Demons, Dragons, Angels, and Reapers. These inhumane creatures are equipped with exciting and powerful special abilities that can aid their factions or hinder their opponents. The game has a very unique card drafting mechanics where the hand of cards are shared between the player and their opponent. Therefore, player must carefully decide when and which politicians to hire for their factions, as those left behind may comeback as a member of the opposition!&#10;&#10;",

The colony of Simiopolis will provide the Simi II and its passengers a place to live. The planet has different types of terrain that include the 3 resources needed to build structures. Unfortunately the engineers have not been given enough time to study the terrain and confirm it's ability to support the massive structures. The crust of the planet is rather thin. Lava like material and massive caverns are occasionally discovered when heavy buildings are built.&#10;&#10;The race is on. Who will build the most and highest quality sections of the colony on Simiopolis?&#10;&#10;Players work outward from their starting tile by Exploring new terrain tiles, Excavating tiles, Expanding onto the tiles and strategically Exterminating previously expanded tiles.&#10;&#10;Players gain points for building (Expanding) structures on tiles, building on the most of each of the 5 types of terrain tiles, for each complete set of 5 terrain tiles they build on and for bonus points received from specific terrain tiles. &#10;Last round starts when a player has built all of his sructures or when two stacks of terrain tiles have been explored. The Engineer with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

An example of this might be &quot;LOL&quot; or &quot;Lionel offered lemons.&quot; Completing a sentence allows that player to receive a point and add an acronym card to the end of the row--making the sentence more complicated for the next player to handle. The next player then needs to say a complete sentence for the next combination of letters. Using the previous example, if &quot;GG&quot; was added after, a sentence could be &quot;Lucy only likes good games.&quot;&#10;&#10;Failing to complete a sentence causes that player to lose a point and the round to end. Players finish a number of rounds corresponding to the number of players playing.&#10;&#10;Action cards add to the mix causing cards to be shuffled, turn order to be reversed, players to be skipped and so much more.&#10;&#10;",

If the moustache shown on the card matches the color or shape of your moustaches, slap it!  The first player to do so collects the card as a point (or pays a penalty if he slapped the card incorrectly).  When the deck runs out, the player with the most cards wins.&#10;&#10;",

Press the button and the shark begins moving towards the island.  On your turn, roll the die and then choose either to a) move your pirate that many spaces or b) collect that many coins.  The shark will begin destroying the path as it advances. If you're caught you'll be knocked into the sea, but if you're fast (and not too greedy), you might make it safely to shore.

Nevertheless, prohibition is going to represent a gold mine for smugglers who dare to challenge the authorities. From the hooligan to the respected politician, many people have tried their luck on this lucrative market, yet it remains a dangerous activity since the agents of the prohibition &mdash; the Prohis &mdash; roam around...     &#10;-    In Prohis, each player embodies a smuggler who tries to make a fortune by transporting illegal goods &mdash; a highly precarious activity since the other players have the opportunity to check your cargo or even seize it if they find suspicious items.     &#10;-         &#10;-    Each player starts with an Inspector, a Captain, and a hand of four cards, with the deck being comprised of legal goods, illegal goods, and Lieutenants. Four cards are placed face-up on the table. On a turn, a player either draws 1-2 cards from those on display or from the deck, or attempts to smuggle a convoy of 2-4 cards by placing them on the table face down.     &#10;-         &#10;-    When smuggling, each other player gets the chance to throw a cargo controller at the smuggled goods, with the highest valued controller taking charge of the inspection. The cargo mover can try to bribe the controller to make this trouble go away, but if that doesn't work an Inspector, the highest rating, can look at three cargo cards, a Captain two, and a Lieutenant one. If the controller reveals an illegal good, the owner of that card gets to seize all of the cargo, placing it and her controller in her warehouse; if all the goods are legal, the shipper claims the cargo in the warehouse and the controller in hand. If a controller awaits among the cargo, then this informant has been revealed and the inspection fails.     &#10;-         &#10;-    When the deck runs out or players all pass on drawing cards, the game ends, with players scoring $4k for each illegal good in the warehouse, $1k for each legal good, and $1-5k for controllers in hand and in the warehouse. Illegal goods in hand cost money, and whoever has the most money wins.&#10;&#10;",

Do you want to nuke or disarm your neighbors? Will you create global peace or Mutually Assured Destruction?&#10;&#10;User addition&#10;Nuclear Poker is a fast playing (10 minutes) card game where users use threats, bluff, trade and psychology to gain nuclear supremacy over the other players.&#10;&#10;The game is meant a fast paced, light hearted, cutthroat game which teaches the participants something about global nuclear warfare and policies like Mutually Assured Destruction.&#10;&#10;Players gather components cards (Uranium, Refinement, Warhead and Test) to get functional nukes. After that they can gather Short Range capability, Second Strike, Long Range and ultimately Superpower. Firing at another player instantly eliminates the other player from the game (unless he owns Second Strike, which allows for one last attack)&#10;&#10;The game is sold with an inbuilt expansion about biochemical weapons, which work likewise: when you own Superpower and gather Lab and Plague, every other player is instantly dead unless he owns Lab too. This makes for even shorter games.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "This game is a combination of two other party game which are &quot;Two Rooms and a Boom&quot; and &quot;Bang!&quot;.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game each player has a role assigned to him/her. There is one role of sheriff and other players are split evenly to gangsters and deputies. After role assigning players are split in two different rooms. In each room players have some time (until they're ready) to vote for a room leader. The room leader chooses two (depending on the number of players) hostages which he will change for other two hostages from another room.&#10;&#10;Additionally each player has a gun with 4 bullets. A player may anytime shoot to anyone. If a player gets shot 7 times he/she's dead and eliminated from the game. The sheriff may not be eliminated, he's got a bulletproof vest. When he gets shot 7 times he shows his card and now everyone in that room knows who the sheriff is.&#10;&#10;A player may anytime freely negotiate with others and also show his role card to anyone. But the players may not show their cards at the same time. They may consult to do it one after the other but no agreement is valid at anytime.&#10;&#10;The goal of the sheriff is to have in his room at the end of the game more deputies than gangsters. In that case he wins and every other alive deputy also wins. If the sheriff does not meet his goal, every gangster who's alive wins.&#10;&#10;",

Time to act!&#10;&#10;Manage your astronaut team, and bring all the damaged systems back into operation. Use your wit to move crates and tools. Delegate people for spacesuit duties in the cosmic void. Use robots for assistance. Do the tasks you've been assigned, or undermine the work of others! Will you succeed in planning your actions efficiently in tight claustrophobic spaces with zero gravity?&#10;&#10;Set in outer space, Astro Jam is a fascinating game of logic for 2-4 people. The emotions that the game releases must go hand in hand with the best of your analytical thinking skills.&#10;&#10;In Astro Jam players operate on a modular game board by playing action cards from their hands and arranging them in sequences. Using the cards, the players move their or the opponents&rsquo; astronaut tokens, use the assistance of common robots, transport crates in narrow space of the orbital station, and send themselves or other astronauts on spacesuit duty. The central computer orders tasks for the players to deliver the objects located at the station into one of three active sites crucial for the operation of the facility. In this way, the players earn points that may ensure the victory. The first player who scores 5 points wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Next to the left column of the grid are die faces 1-6 from bottom to top, and above the top row are the numbers 1-6 from left to right.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player rolls the half-dozen six-sided dice once. If she wishes, she can change any die face to a lower number as long as that number is one that she rolled. If she wishes, she then places tokens on the grid to match the die combinations rolled. For example, if she rolls 5-4-4-3-3-2, she could change all the dice to 2, then cover the six 2s space on her grid; she could also change the 5 to a 4 and the 3s to 2s, then cover the three 4s space and the three 2s space. A player doesn't have to place tokens on her turn.&#10;&#10;Once someone places her 18th token on her grid, the game ends after everyone has had the same number of turns, then players score points. Each token in the outer border is worth 1-6 crowns, depending on where it's located; each token in the inner grid is worth points only if it's part of a complete row of five tokens, and you score points (3-20, depending on the row) only for those completed rows, not for each covered space in the grid. Whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

Tiles are numbered 1-14 in four colors, with each number appearing twice; special tiles show a &quot;swap&quot; symbol and &quot;+3&quot;. Six tiles are laid face up on the table, while the rest remain in the draw bag. On a turn, a player does one of the following four actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Draws a face-up tile, then replaces it with a random tile from the bag.&#10;    Draws a random tile from the bag.&#10;    Uses a special action tile to force an opponent to draw three tiles or force each player to give two tiles to her left-hand neighbor.&#10;    Plays one or more tiles.&#10;&#10;&#10;A player must first start a group in front of her by playing either a set of 3-4 tiles of the same number and different colors or a sequence of at least three tiles of the same color with numbers in ascending or descending order. Once a player has a group in front of her, she can play tiles on other groups already on the table as long as she doesn't create a set or sequence of only two tiles. A player can rearrange tiles and combine groups as long as no tiles remain on their own; if she combines groups, she can then start a new group.&#10;&#10;As soon as one player is out of tiles, the game ends and she wins. Alternatively, players can play multiple rounds, with those who still have tiles in hand scoring penalty points for what they still hold.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, either you play a card to the right of your player board as an expedition supporter &mdash; thereby increasing your technology, provision or clothing resources &mdash; then draw a card to end your turn, or you play a card above your player board to represent the explorer who has hired you to take him on a trip. To be hired by that explorer, though, your expedition must meet the demands of that explorer card in the category shown, such as having a technology level of at least five. When you place an explorer, you carry out the special power shown on that card, such as giving other players additional cards, taking an extra turn, or stealing equipment or explorers from others.&#10;&#10;Once a player has laid his final card, the round ends immediately. Players earn money equal to the value of the explorers lying above their boards, then lose two coins for each card still in hand. The player with the most money after three rounds wins.&#10;&#10;In the expert game, each player board has different starting values for the technology, provision and clothing resources as well as a special unique ability that a player can use once during a turn.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Custodial Trap: The Game is a game created to show off the Custodial Trap move type seen in a number of games designed by Rich Hutnik. The move type is akin to Custodial Capture seen in Tafl family of games, or Custodial Conversion seen in Othello/Reversi. The custodial trap move involves two pieces bookending a line of enemy pieces, and freezing them so they can't move. In a future turn, one of the two pieces freezing enemy pieces, which isn't also trapped, can then move one space and occupy an enemy piece that it is freezing, and capture it.&#10;&#10;Custodial Trap: The Game, is played on an 8x8 chessboard with 18 pieces each in two different colors that are identical.  Chess pawns or checkers work.  In the basic game, the pieces are set up in a 6x6 alternating pattern of of opposing pieces, that form a checkerboard pattern.  Pieces on the corners are the only ones free.   Object of the basic game is to either prevent one's opponent from having no legal moves or capturing at least 12 of their opponent's pieces.&#10;&#10;The advanced version of the game, introduces a new win condition of a player connecting all their not capture pieces into oone orthogonally connected group of piece.  In addition, players also can start with pieces off the board, and one player sets up the pieces for both players, and the other player picks what side to play, utilizing a Limited Dutch Offer (this is an extended version of the pie rule).&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "BACKGROUND: Soldiers of Glory is an adventure game for 1-4 Players, where players assume the roles of young Soldiers of Fortune during the 1600s. Each Player creates a Hero Character in search of Wealth, Adventure and Renown. To survive and thrive in a land torn apart by Religious Wars, Intrigue, Piracy and Plague, the Player Heroes must seek employment from a variety of Patrons and perform Assignments such as escorting envoys, participating in Battles, dueling rivals, espionage, political intrigue, rescuing damsels, and assassinations. As your Hero gains experience and renown they can improve their attributes and status.&#10;&#10;GAME OBJECTIVE: The Objective of each Player Hero is to Gain as much Renown Points (RP) to become a Nobleman. Game length is determined by the Nobility Title desired: Baron (60RP), Count (80RP) or Duke (100RP). In order to become a Nobleman, the Player Hero must complete Assignments to earn enough RP to purchase the various Titles.&#10;&#10;GAME FEATURES: Soldiers of Glory features lots and lots of colorful game counters including Swordsmen, Cavaliers, Brigands, Soldiers, Assassins, Nobles, Femmes Fatal, fierce animals, and much more. The game is played on a 6 Sheet Map with Large Hexes and a variety of terrain. Game includes Duels, Skirmishes, Battles, Fortress Assaults, Combat at Sea, Pirates and more.&#10;&#10;If you are a fan of the Three Musketeers, any Errol Flynn movie, Alatriste, and other swashbuckling tales, this game is for you.&#10;&#10;ASSEMBLY TIME: This game, since there are a lot of counters, may take longer than the designer's other games. It took me about 4 hours at industrious pace.&#10;&#10;",

This flexibility, mixed with a uniquely interactive game play, make Don&rsquo;t Be a Loser an absolute hit among the fun-loving party crowd.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to be the Biggest Winner, but more importantly, to not be the Biggest Loser.  n order to advance down the board players compete in a wide variety of one-on-one challenges including physical challenges, Mathlete questions, Super Sleuth puzzles, acting challenges, creativity challenges and much more.  Other players are able to bet on which player they think will win, keeping everyone involved as much as they wish to be and making the competition to not be a Loser fierce.&#10;&#10;The exciting twist: before starting the game players all decide on the penalty the Biggest Loser will pay.  It could be as simple as having to sing a silly song or to buy the next round of beverages, to more serious stakes such as the Biggest Loser having to wash the Biggest Winner&rsquo;s car.  Needless to say, you don&rsquo;t want to be a loser!&#10;&#10;",

Players have to reach their opponent&rsquo;s goal by throwing 2 dice at once. Starting from the middle they put the ball forward on the opponent&rsquo;s half as many places as they have thrown. A player may continue during the same turn until the ball lands on a zone with a number in the opponent&rsquo;s colour. The ball keeps moving to and from until a goal has been scored (reaching no. 45 exactly). Then the other player starts in the middle again.Some zones are yellow-coloured which represent certain events like free kick, penalty or corner with their respective special actions. The player who scored most goals during playing time of 2x15 minutes wins the game. If both players scored an equal amount of goals it is a draw.&#10;&#10;",

Each player will control a six-member gang competing to survive with only their instincts, a quick draw, and dynamite.&#10;&#10;The game is played in turns. Each player has a home base card in front of them. Each turn, the player whose turn it is flips open a card from the common deck. The other players now have a chance to react.&#10;&#10;&#10;    If a Talkin&rsquo; Iron card is revealed, players can choose to make an offensive or a defensive move. If players want to take a shot, they can slap one hand on the Talkin&rsquo; Iron card and simultaneously make a pistol-finger with their other hand, pointing at any other player. Only one player gets to actually take a shot - the one who slaps the Talkin&rsquo; Iron card first. Instead of trying to slap the gun, players can slap into a home base by slapping any of the home bases on the table. Only one player&rsquo;s hand can be in a home base at a time. Players who slap into a home base can&rsquo;t be hit by a player who takes a shot, and they can safely keep their hand on that home base until they&rsquo;re forced to move.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    If a Big Gun card is revealed, players can slap it to take a shot or slap into a home base. Just like a Talkin&rsquo; Iron, only one player can use it to take a shot - the first one to slap the card and simultaneously point a pistol-finger at another player. Unlike a Talkin&rsquo; Iron, a Big Gun is extraordinarily destructive, and damages players even if they&rsquo;re in a home base.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    If a Gold card is revealed, players can take the card into their possession by slapping it. If you point at another player while slapping the gold, the player you point at takes the gold instead. Gold is required to activate most gang&rsquo;s special powers.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    When a Move! card is revealed, everyone needs to slap into a home base. If a player is already in a home base, they need to slap into a new home base. The last player to slap into a new home base loses one member of their gang. If anyone mistakenly slaps the Move! card, they lose one gang member, everyone else is safe regardless of where they slapped, and the turn ends.&#10;&#10;&#10;Players take turns until only one gang is left standing.&#10;&#10;",

A huge amount of museums await the public with unique art and science exhibitions. From the world famous opera to clubs, from shopping to recreational areas - all are easily reached by public transport. There are many charming caf&eacute;s which serve cake specialities or the viennese favourite, the &quot;Melange&quot; to strengthen tourists on their way. Vienna has something to offer any taste - day or night!&quot;&#10;&#10;This simple game is played on a city map of Vienna. The map features stations of public transport facilites: underground, bus and tramway. At the beginning of the game, a player's pawn is put on a random station. He then draws a number of destination cards showing the stations he must visit in order to win the game.&#10;&#10;On his turn, a player rolls five special dice, showing the symbols &quot;underground&quot;, &quot;bus&quot; and &quot;tramway&quot;. He then moves his pawn from station to station, using only the transport facilities his dice offers him. If he reaches a station which corresponds with one of his destination cards, he may discard that destination card.&#10; You win the game if you have visited all destinations on all your destination cards.&#10;&#10;",

Cooperation is important as these cards can be in use by different players when realizing a project. Additional money can be earned by players if an opponent lands on their building project already  realized. If all construction sites are built up, the game ends. The player who owns most money at that moment wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "It is the dawn of a new year. The old king has just died childless, and the new succession must be decided before the end of this year. You are a local baron or countess with as good a claim as anyone else, so now is the time to grab the throne. Your peers understand only force, and your subjects understand only gold. Gather your men, pay your knights, and assert your claim. Everyone will recognize the strongest and richest as the rightful monarch.&#10;&#10;In Melee you want to be the first person to capture an opposing castle (at which point the game ends immediately) or to have the most land and gold at the end of the year. Money is tight, and gold is used in the game both to build new units and to attack. The more gold you have and spend on your troops, the more motivated they will be and the higher your probability of success.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with a Castle, one unit of foot soldiers, and 15 gold coins. The game begins with a drafting session in which you purchase units (soldiers, knights, camps and catapults) and bid on special abilities that will enhance your income, attack, or other options in the game.&#10;&#10;The game is then played over four turns (seasons), and in each turn players simultaneously choose one of three potential actions: (a) tax, (b) build new units, or (c) move and attack. Each turn ends with players collecting income.&#10;&#10;To attack, you move your unit into an occupied area, then secretly decide how much gold you will spend to motivate your troops. The defender then has to guess how much you have spent. If the defender guesses wrong, the attack succeeds; if the defender is correct, the attack fails and you lose your unit. Regardless of success you have spent your gold, so the tight trade-off that players have to assess is whether to be cheap with your men so that you can conserve gold for future builds and attacks, or be generous to increase your chances now but limit future options.&#10;&#10;The different abilities available in each game make for varied strategies and strong replayability as no two games are alike. After the initial strategic planning stage, Melee is fast and highly interactive. Beware as the game can end suddenly with a bold attack on an inadequately defended castle, making for a game that can be very nasty, brutish and short.&#10;&#10;",

If the gardener has fewer than five points, the gardeners reset the board and start a new round with three buds of their eight; if the gardener has five or more points, the game ends and he wins!&#10;&#10;",

Players are professional bootleggers tasked with moving alcohol regularly shipped to their ports to the different establishments around town through a combination of their runner units, dogface or muscle units, and their special units, the latter of which differs from player to player. Opposing players will also try to supply establishments as well as take over establishments already being supplied so players need to balance expanding their empire with defending it. The goal of the game is to be the first player to reach 5,000 rubes, the in-game currency. Money is earned from the different establishments around town as well as start up money.&#10;&#10;",

The player with the most money at the end of Tornado Season wins.&#10;&#10;StormChasers takes place over 10 rounds or at the end of the round in which all tornadoes have dissipated, whichever comes first. Each round starts with the Tornado Phase, in which tornadoes are spawned and moved according to the Tornado Deck. Following the Tornado Phase is the Action Phase in which players spend action points to move vehicles and take pictures of tornadoes. Money is gained from taking pictures with the first pictures earning the most money, and further pictures earning successively less. Following the Action Phase is the Upgrade/Cleanup phase. Here you must balance end game money with upgrading to better protected and faster vehicles.&#10;&#10;Gameplay occurs on a 20x20 hexagonal grid. The board is littered with many different type of &quot;Landscape&quot; tiles [house, barn, and field tiles] that inhibit movement, but also provide bonus points if a picture is captured during destruction. These tiles are placed randomly during setup. Road tiles are also included and provide bonuses to movement.  Road tiles are placed either according to scenario rules or by each player in turn order.&#10;&#10;The tornadoes are spawned and moved via the &quot;Storm Deck&quot; which is built during setup. The game's speed is dictated by the number of spawning cards, with the higher ratio equaling a faster game. Tornadoes dissipate randomly via dice and time track mechanic.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, players count only money on hand. The player with the most wins, ties are broken in favor of the player with the most pictures taken.&#10;&#10;",

Doing this he should try to achieve a result of one thousand (or as close as possible) when making a final addition if the matrix is full (by considering each row of 3 cells as a number and adding those 3 numbers). The player closest to thousand is the winner. Attention! If one of the diagonals shows 3 same numbers, this number may be multiplied by 10 and used as a bonus to come closer to thousand.&#10;&#10;",

Players have a pool of six dice to roll that they manage according to the action they want to perform (such as movement, attack, etc.) and its effectiveness. Each face of the dice shows either a 1, 2 or the Special Power symbol and the sum of the results shown represents the effectiveness of the action performed by the heroes. Every time the Special Power symbol occurs, the hero can choose to charge one of his abilities; once fully charged, the hero can unleash its power against the enemies!&#10;&#10;Are you ready for the biggest adventure of all times?&#10;&#10;",

In the middle of the field, three white magnetic pieces serve as &quot;obstacles&quot; &ndash; do NOT attract them to your own gaming piece! Your gaming piece is a black magnet. You control it by holding a large magnet under the board. This magnet is connected to a small magnet placed on the field. The purpose of the game is to push the small, red ball around on the field with your magnet/gaming piece, shoot the ball past the obstacles and your opponent and into the goal hole (Klask). It&rsquo;s so much fun when your opponent suddenly is covered in white obstacles or you drop your gaming piece into the goal &ndash; something which might happen if you get a little too eager!&#10;&#10;Place the game board on a table between the two players. Place the three white magnetic pieces on the white fields on the board. Put two coins in each point slot next to the &quot;0&quot;. Each player has a black magnetic gaming piece in two parts. Place the short (thin) part on top of the board and the long (thick) part under the board in such a way, so the two parts &ldquo;catch&rdquo; each other. Place the ball in the corner start field. Steer it with the black gaming pieces.&#10;&#10;The youngest player starts the game. You score a point if:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The ball ends in your opponent's hole and stays in the hole.&#10;    Two or all of the three white magnetic pieces stick to your opponent's gaming piece.&#10;    The opponent accidentally pulls their gaming piece into their own goal hole.&#10;    If the opponent loses their gaming piece.&#10;&#10;&#10;Each time you get a point, you must move your coin one point forward in the point slot. The player who first reaches the KLASK field wins.&#10;&#10;During the game:&#10;&#10;&#10;    If one of the white magnetic pieces sticks to a gaming piece, the game continues; if two of the white magnetic pieces stick to one gaming piece, the opponent gets one point.&#10;    If the ball falls over the edges of the board, you must place the ball in the corner start field in the half from which the ball fell.&#10;    If one or more white magnetic pieces fall over the edges of the board, the game continues.&#10;    Each time a player scores a point, you must put the white magnetic pieces back on the white fields on the board, and the player who did not score a point places the ball in their corner start field.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Win the game.&#10;&#10;Escape Pod is the first in a trilogy of co-operative games about leading a doomed crew to their rescue. Each player assumes the role of a member of the ISS Powhatan, a supply ship in the Junxti system. When the ship is boarded by hostile aliens, the crew must work together to gather supplies and prepare the escape pod. Finally, you must activate the self-destruct system and escape to the planet below!&#10;&#10;Gameplay consists of players taking turns. At the beginning of their turn each player rolls dice to place aliens on the board and then navigates the ship using their action points. Players can search rooms to reveal item cards that will assist them in their efforts. When a player comes into a room with aliens, combat ensues utilizing an 8 sided die with the outcome influenced by weapons the player may have. Certain rooms such as the fuel tanks and the transporter rooms can be &quot;activated&quot; to accomplish the goal and allow the players to escape!&#10;&#10;Player characters include; Captain, Security Officer, Transporter Chief, Damage Controlman, Quartermaster, Chief Engineer, and Sensor Operator. Each character has a unique ability to assist in the players winning the game.&#10;&#10;",

For the first turn, the player takes any two cards, swaps them, then sums these numbers (summing the numbers again if the sum is larger than nine). For example, if the player swaps cards 6 and 8, their sum is 14, and the sum of those numbers is 5. For the next swap, the player must swap card 5 with some other card. If the player places the cards in descending order from 9-1, she wins.&#10;&#10;The cards in Flip 9 are double-sided, though, and should you become at ease with the basic game, you can advance to the harder one. To start, flip half the cards to show the other side, then lay them out in a row. Each turn you'll still swap two cards, with every swap after the first having one of the cards being determined by the sum of the previous swap &mdash; but now you must also flip over the two cards being swapped. To win, you must place the cards in descending order from 9-1 and have the same side face up on all of the cards.&#10;&#10;",

The mission is to make a  successful marriage proposal, but to do so you must overcome every opposition along the way. Good luck with your fight for true love! - From the manual&#10;&#10;In Love and War is a rummy-style card game for 2-5 players. Each turn players draw a card and discard a card representing romantic acts, aiming to fill their hand with two sets of three and one pair. If another player discards a card that completes your set, you may interject &quot;Meow!&quot;  to interrupt the normal turn order and steal it. When you finish all three sets, say &quot;Meow Meow Meow!&quot; to trigger a marriage proposal. Shuffle a special &quot;Yes, I do&quot; card into your hand and draw a card randomly. If you draw the &quot;I do&quot; card, you win! But other players with the same cards may add them to your shuffled hand to reduce your chance of success. If you fail, the game continues but you may take an extra &quot;I do&quot; card during your next proposal attempt.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In 1978 four friends experience a nightmarish ordeal.  Steve, Randy, Ginger, and Dawn innocently set out to camp and enjoy the countryside near a small town on Halloween.  Unfortunately their car breaks down and they meet with pure darkness, the Psycho Raiders, once they are on your trail, they hunt to the death...&#10;&#10;This horrifying halloween night may not be survived.  The true story of what happened on this fateful evening comes alive in the pages and gameplay of Halloween Nightmares.&#10;&#10;Psycho Raiders is a horror simulation experience.  Unlike games that tend to aim for perfect balance, Psycho Raiders' main focus is delivering the terrifying experience that occurred on this Halloween night.   Characters and situations are not balanced to equal one another but created to simulate the actual experience.  The game begins very slanted to the raiders, they will assuredly destroy if fighting just ill prepared campers.  Through the use of finding weapons or alerting the nearby town folk of Crucible, the campers can possibly turn the tables on the raiders.  But there may also be a horrid realization that certain town folk are raiders themselves. The campers may not be able to trust anyone!  It might be best to run! RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN!&#10;&#10;Psycho Raiders is a tactical hex and counter game with each token representing an individual character. Characters have sheets with some individual stats related to speed, strength and will to live. In the short game, the campers can win if any of them escape the north end of the map while hidden.&#10;&#10;Psycho Raiders is a very visceral experience and we have rated it X. Anyone one under the age of 18 is NOT permitted to play.   Pregnant or players with a fragile or nervous disposition are strongly encouraged NOT TO PLAY THIS GAME!&#10;&#10;GAME COMIC CREATED BY CHARLIE FOGEL!&#10;&#10;Note: Psycho Raiders is the first game featured in our &quot;Halloween Nightmares Horrorgame Magazine&quot;, a game magazine dedicated to Halloween and the Horrorgame genre.  Players will need to xerox elements and provide two D6 and pencils to play this game&#10;&#10;",

Let the race begin!&#10;&#10;You and your opponents move around the board, answering questions and acting out tasks for each of the four categories. Doing so correctly will earn you a cushion of the corresponding color. Helping your opponent with a task will earn you a heart. Hearts can be used to buy cushions or to mend broken hearts. If you land on a broken heart tile and don't mend it (by choice or because you don't have any heart tokens) you risk losing one of your cushions. The first person to collect all four cushions and make it to the love suite wins the game!&#10;&#10;",

Kids won't know they're learning how to think strategically, and adults will wish they remembered how! Four levels of difficulty provide a challenge for anyone who sits down with Dozen Doubloons in front of them.&#10;&#10;The deck consists of 54 cards.  There are four sets of numbers 1 through 12, plus 4 BLOCK cards, and 2 WILD cards. The object of the game is to deplete all cards in play.&#10;&#10;Shuffle. Deal 6 stacks of four cards face down, and a fifth card on each stack face up.  The remaining cards are your draw stack. To play: combine up to three cards that equal 12, and place them in a discard pile.  Turn over the next card in each of your stacks.  If a BLOCK card shows up, do not remove the card but move it and all cards underneath it to a position above any other unblocked stack.  You may not touch the BLOCK stack until the stack beneath it is depleted.  Once the stack is depleted, slide the whole BLOCK stack down into position, discard the BLOCK card, turn over the next card, and continue playing.&#10;&#10;When there are no cards that equal 12 (or if you choose not to use a combination that is available), turn over the first DRAW card. If it's usable, use it. If not, place it face down in front of you.  Continue to DRAW cards as needed, and keep placing them to the right of the original card. If a BLOCK card comes up from the DRAW pile, discard it and ALL the other cards accumulated from previous draws--they are now out of play.&#10;&#10;Once you have gone through your DRAW pile one time, the game is over.  If you have not depleted all six original stacks, you have lost.&#10;&#10;This is a summary of the rules and not meant to cover all possible scenarios.&#10;&#10;",

The last star warrior standing rules the Parax System.&#10;&#10;The Amega Weapon is played on a game board that is created by placing 4 different boards together in any way, shape, or fashion that you choose with over 30,000 possible game board variations.  The boards are the beautiful artwork of Greg Winters, illustrator of Star Wars featuring 12 planets, 6 star bases, novae, and asteroids.  Greg also created our fantastic box cover.&#10;&#10;The Amega Weapon showcases 7 custom designed pewter playing pieces that we spin cast ourselves. Additional components include: top notch quality Mission Profile cards, Deep Space cards, Asteroid cards, and 6 denominations of money along with two 6-sided dice, a 10-sided die, and a 20-sided die.&#10;&#10;Players can elect to play one-on-one, team play, or a regular game.  The game is player tested for ages 12 and up with a special kid's game for ages 6 and up that does not interfere with the normal game.&#10;The questions you have to ask yourself are: Can you obtain The Amega Weapon?  Can you obliterate your opponents?  Will you survive the Black Star?  Do you even think you stand a chance?  Got control???  Think again, lol!!!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Planetaire is a astronomy-themed educational rummy-type card game for one to four players. This description will focus on the 2 to 4 player game, but there are also variants for one player or for 4 players on 2 teams. When playing with 2 or more people, the object of the game is to be the first player to make The Grand Tour by collecting all 9 planetary suites, including Pluto as a planet since the game was published before 2006. In case of a tie (2 or more players completing The Grand Tour in the same round), the player who completed the Grand Tour who has the most points wins. A planetary suite consists of a planet and all of its moons. For the sake of not making the sets impossible, the gas giants Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune each have 4 moons in this game. The moonless Mercury and Venus count as complete sets by themselves. The planets are categorized as inner or outer based on their position relative to the main Asteroid Belt located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.&#10;&#10;The game has 92 playing cards, a pad of scoring sheets, a rules booklet, and 4 reference cards, which list all the cards needed for each of the 9 suites. The set of cards are color-coded by type, and each planet is also in a different color to make it easier to see what goes together. There are 2 of each planet and the 20 moons used in this game, and 1 each of 8 asteroids and 8 comets. There are also 10 wild cards which can serve in place of other cards, 2 each of 5 different types. The two Planet X cards will substitute for planets. The other 8 wild cards can all substitute for moons, with 4 of them also being usable for an asteroid, the other 4 for a comet. There are also 8 action cards, 4 which reverse the player order and give the person playing the card an extra turn, and 4 which discard a moon card (you can either discard one yourself, or make the next player discard one before beginning their turn, which can result in some complications if they don't have any moons or moon wild cards in their hand). Action cards are played by discarding them at the end of your turn (if you choose to use the discard moon card on yourself, you get to discard that card and one of your moons, with the moon card on top in the discard pile).&#10;&#10;During each turn, you start by drawing until you have 10 cards in your hand (at game start, you have 9). So the smaller your hand is at the beginning of your turn, the better are your chances to draw cards you need. You can then lay down any number of comets and asteroids, up to the maximum of 2 of each, but can only lay down the planet and moon cards when you have a complete set of the same color - a planetary suite, or enough wild cards to substitute for the cards you don't have. You can use any number of wild cards in making a set but cannot play 2 of the same moon in a suite - but must have 1 of each or a suitable wild card. You can also pick up wild cards or complete planetary suites if you can replace them from your hand. You don't need to replace a Wild Card in order to pick it up if it was acting as a comet or asteroid. You can use a planet you scored in a previous round, which is called Retro-Touring. Laying down a previously scored planetary suite does not earn you more points but can serve the player doing this in several ways. You end each turn by discarding a card from your hand, whether or not you laid down any cards on the table. You can not have more than 2 asteroids, 2 comets, 1 Inner Planetary Suite, and 1 Outer Planetary Suite laid down on the table at the same time. If you have all of these in front of you, you are said to &quot;Go Out&quot; and the round ends immediately.  When one player completes all the cards to Go Out, ending the round, all the other players are then said to be Set. &quot;Set&quot; players are penalized for the point value of the cards in their hand. You count up the points of all the cards you laid down, with the planets and Planet X on the table being multiplied by 10, and then everyone except the player Going Out have to subtract the point value of the cards in their hand (planets are at face value for this portion of the scoring). This can result in a negative score. Most of the wild cards have a value of 0, with the exception of the 2 Planet X cards, which are worth 10. The moons, asteroids, and comets are worth 1. Action cards in the hand of a &quot;set&quot; player cost them two points. The planets increase in point value from 1 to 9 based on distance from the Sun (so Mercury is 1, Pluto is 9, etc). Usually one player is designated as the scorer and writes down everyone's points at the end of each round. You only score for a completed planetary suite the first time you use that particular planet.&#10;&#10;The rulebook suggests that a different player should be dealer in each round. The Dealer rotates counter-clockwise in each round, and the players also go in this order, with the player to the right of the dealer going first. This direction is used because it corresponds with the orbits of the planets around the sun. This brings up some of the other educational aspects of this game. Each of the cards has a photograph or art of the object, and a few interesting facts about the object pictured. The Wild Cards are named after and depict other objects in the Solar System that are not in the normal cards. There is also more information and many website links of other educational resources in the rulebook.&#10;&#10;There is a Solitaire version of the game, in which there is no point scoring or shuffling of cards within a round, the planets have to be obtained in a specific order, you deal cards and draw to a Phantom player (which are not available until you shuffle for the next round), and there are also 9 cards permanently discarded at the beginning of the game.&#10;&#10;",

The attacking is rolling for crowbars and the defender is trying to get enough trashcan lids to defend.&#10;The winner gets to root through the other players hand, or even put nasty things into it.  If the winner is the person who started they fight they then get to rummage through the pile of trash.&#10;Rummage through the trash, while collecting trash cards and trying to create matching sets of items. Match the image and names of the items on the face of your cards.&#10;&#10;The goal of all versions of Dumpster Brawl is to collect enough matching trash items to make at least three (3) sets of three (3) or more matching items (such as three pizza boxes, three apple cores, and three soda cans) while not having any extra cards in your hand that are not part of the matched sets you are laying down. All extra cards, that do not match your victory sets, have to be discarded before you can lay your sets down and win.&#10;&#10;Note: You can have more than three sets and the sets can be larger than three cards.&#10;All play styles of Dumpster Brawl require the collection of the trash cards.&#10;&#10;There are thirteen (13) types of trash items and seven (7) of each item in the game.&#10;While rooting around in the trash you are, also, looking for booster cards that can help you win and defeating the blocker cards you might encounter as they can hurt your chances at winning but beware the slugs!&#10;&#10;Key Features&#10;&bull;    Quick fun game play&#10;&bull;    Multiple play methods&#10;&bull;    Each play is unique&#10;&bull;    You have to make sure you keep and discard the right cards and play your boosters at the right time&#10;&#10;",

In the second part, players take turns playing the sheriff who is trying to retrace the steps of the robber, visiting the same places as the robber has before. The story element helps players do just that, and they earn points by correctly guessing the next building.&#10;&#10;",

This game has been effective in increasing the availability of user-friendly information regarding the transportation planning process. It has also enabled the tribal community to understand the challenges associated with highway planning and to become more engaged in transportation planning projects in their community. The game describes the various stages involved in reservation road planning including: Develop a Plan, Indian Reservation Road Inventory, Funding, Preconstruction, and Construction. An overview is also provided regarding the various public involvement options associated with each planning stage. The game utilizes scenarios to explain the challenges associated with each stage. Some of the lessons learned that will be featured include the utilization of user-friendly techniques for communicating the transportation planning process, the importance of tailoring information to meet specific needs of the tribal community, and the use of interactive techniques to engage the public in the transportation planning process. The board game was available by request at www.roadplanner.org, but the site is now defunct. You can still request a copy by contacting your local Bureau of Indian Affairs, or the public affairs department of the US Dept. of Transportation.&#10;&#10;",

Within its confines, untold thousands of Genestealers slowly emerge from hibernation. The Space Marines must enter the cramped corridors and tomb-like chambers of the ancient ship to defeat this alien menace.&#10;&#10;Space Hulk is a board game for two players, recreating the battles fought between the Space Marines and Genestealers. One player commands the Space Marines as they carry out deadly missions in the ancient Space Hulk, and the other commands the horde of Genestealers opposing them. Space Hulk's fast-paced rules simulate the tense atmosphere of a mission deep inside the cramped confines of a derelict space hulk, where split-second decisions are needed for victory.&#10;&#10;This new version has 4 extra missions, Boarding Torpedoes, Damage Control Room, Breach Counters (for where the Boarding Torpedoes hit or something else), and a Turbo-lift Tile allowing for multiple levels to clear of Genestealers.&#10;&#10;Also new for this edition are three mini-campaign packs released for the iPad:&#10;-Space Hulk Mission Files: Dark Angels &ndash; Bringers of Sorrow&#10;-Space Hulk Mission Files: Ultramarines &ndash; Duty and Honour&#10;-Space Hulk Mission Files: Space Wolves &ndash; Return to Kalidus&#10;&#10;Each Mini campaign comprises 3 missions specific to the chapter, and rules for creating new missions, plus a brief Chapter history.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Rise of the Northmen is an action point allowance game in which 2-3 players expand their own viking tribes and conquer new lands in search of riches and glory.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a map of Scandinavia and the northern European islands. (The map is based off of old viking maps, it represents what they had mapped out to be the northern European islands.  In actuality there were not as many scattered islands as they had thought.  Thematically, this was the way they pictured the world to the west.)&#10;&#10;There are three main sectors on the map, from east to west they are A, B and C.  The greatest rewards can be found to the far west in the C sector, but they are also the hardest to reach as they require long journeys across the sea.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with 3 vikings on the board, 2 steel and 2 food tokens, 5 ship tokens and 12 vikings in reserve, and 10 shield tokens.  During each turn players will each have 7 action points they can use for movement, harvesting resources, razing villages, building ships and sailing, constructing runes to the gods, and attacking each other, all of which offer varying victory point margins.  Many of the actions require resources and troops to complete, requiring players to plan ahead in order to carry out their turns.&#10;&#10;The game is driven by an event deck of 32 cards.  At the beginning of each round one card is drawn from the event deck, some random events will help all players and some will hurt all players, most of the events are Crusader cards that correspond to the 3 sectors.  When a Crusader card is drawn a die is rolled  for its corresponding sector and a Crusader shield is placed in that village, players can destroy the Crusader shields for points and are encouraged to because if a 7th Crusader shield is ever placed on the map then all players lose the game.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player places their 10th player shield on a village, or when the event deck runs out.  Players then tally their points for player shields, Crusader shields, vikings and ships on the board, runes, money, attack tokens, and so forth, and whoever has the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Volume V in GMT&rsquo;s COIN Series takes us back to the struggle of the American Patriots against their parent British government.   A unique multi-faction treatment of the American Revolution, Liberty or Death: The American Insurrection will take 1 to 4 players between lines of clashing red and blue infantry, Indian raids, European politics, British control of the seas, French intervention, and the propaganda war.&#10;&#10;Building off the good works of COIN Series Creator Volko Ruhnke and Series Designers Jeff Grossman, Brian Train, Mark Herman, and Andrew Ruhnke Designer Harold Buchanan applies his knowledge of the American Revolutionary period to take a new look at the struggle that built a nation. COIN Series Developer Mike Bertucelli continues his work on this project and Volko Ruhnke is an active advisor.&#10;&#10;Liberty or Death: The American Insurrection features the same card-assisted counterinsurgency game system as GMT's Andean Abyss, Cuba Libre, A Distant Plain, Fire in the Lake and Gallic War with a set of twists that take the COIN Series to the 18th Century, including:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Brilliant Strokes that trump initiative (Led by leaders like Washington, Rochambeau, Clinton and Joseph Brant) &#10;    Irregular troops (Patriot Militia and Indian War Parties) &#10;    Regular troops (British and French Regulars and Patriot Continentals)  for battles and skirmishes with line infantry &#10;    Rabble Rousing, Skirmishing, Tories, variable French entry, and Indian Raids&#10;    Variable impact of naval commitments between the British and French &#10;    French blockades to confound British plans&#10;    French financing options to feed the Patriot&rsquo;s war effort&#10;    A large deck of 110 + cards for great play variety &#10;    Short, medium, and long-length scenarios with period-event or random options. &#10;&#10;&#10;Each faction in Liberty or Death brings new capabilities and challenges:&#10;&#10;As the British, you have to deal with an Insurrection across a massive region.  With control of the seas (at least until the French arrive), you have extreme flexibility and can move across the coast and cities at will.  You will muster Tories to support your efforts.  They will march with you to battle, but they need your cover.  You can control any space you choose, but you cannot answer every threat on the map.  The Indians will work with you but, like the Tories, will need you to coordinate and protect them when the Patriots become aggressive.  With the leadership of Gage, Howe, and then Clinton, you will be able to strike a potentially decisive Brilliant Stroke if the stars align.  Each leader brings something new to the war effort.  If you can strike the decisive blow and Win the Day you will be able to build Support and reduce Opposition in short order.  If the option to Battle the French in the Colonies presents itself, it will be hard to pass up!&#10;&#10;As the Patriots, you initially aren&rsquo;t powerful enough to counteract the British Army.  You will need to pick your battles and initially spread the Militia to key areas.  Over time you can train a force of Continentals to take on the British Regulars.  Until then, Rabble-rouse and work with the French to challenge British dominance.  Skirmish with the British in small numbers to make their stay expensive.  Will the French be there when you need them?  Persuade the local population to give you resources to keep the heat up.  Watch the Indians on the Frontier because if they develop their forces unanswered you won&rsquo;t be able to win the game regardless of what happens with the British.&#10;&#10;As the Indian player, you have selected the lesser of two evils in aligning with the British.  You will work with them to lower Opposition using Raids but you will be developing your footprint by Gathering forces and building villages.  The British can help you to protect them from the Patriots and in return you can assist the British in controlling the region.  War Chief Joseph Brant and later War Chief Cornplanter give you the ability to mount a decisive attack with your War Parties but will it be worth exposing your villages to Patriot attack?&#10;&#10;As the French, you have the ability to be the thorn in the side of the British in North America.  With the Hortalez Rodrigue et Cie Company, formed to feed the Patriots resources, you can fund the Insurrection.  Your agents can rally assistance in and around Quebec and you can facilitate privateers to steal resources from the British. When you sign the Treaty of Alliance with the Patriots, you can bring French Regulars to America to March and Battle.  You can also increase French Naval Intervention, Blockade Cities, move Regulars by sea and Skirmish with the British.&#10;&#10;As with earlier COIN Series volumes, players of Liberty or Death: The American Insurrection will face difficult strategic decisions with each card.  The innovative game system smoothly integrates political, cultural, and economic affairs with military and other violent and non-violent Commands and capabilities.  Rabble-rousing, Indian Raids, Persuasion, Naval Pressure, Letter of Marque, Looting, Trading, Skirmishing, and Foraging and more options are available.  Flow charts are at hand to run any faction short a player&mdash;solitaire, 2-player, 3-player, or 4-player experiences are equally supported.&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS&#10;    A 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; mounted game board.&#10;    A deck of 110+ playing cards.&#10;    166 red, green, tan, blue, and white wooden playing pieces, some embossed.&#10;    6 black and 6 gray wooden pawns.&#10;    4 foldout Faction player aid sheets.&#10;    2 foldout Non-player Faction aid sheets.&#10;    2 Sequence sheets.&#10;    A Random Spaces sheet.&#10;    2 sheets of markers.&#10;    Rulebook.&#10;    Playbook.&#10;    1 black six-sided die&#10;    3 blue six-sided dice marked 1-3 twice. &#10;    3 red six-sided dice marked 1-3 twice.&#10;    9 plastic leader stands.&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Harold Buchanan&#10;SERIES DEVELOPER: Mike Bertucelli&#10;SOLITAIRE SYSTEM DEVELOPER: Orjan Ariander&#10;MAP ART: Terry Leeds&#10;COUNTER ART: Charles Kibler, Terry Leeds, and Mark Simonitch&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE:    One year per Campaign between Winter Quarters&#10;MAP SCALE:     Area movement&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS:     1 to 4&#10;&#10;(source: GMT website)&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In 3-Wide you decide how far to push your drivers abilities and the endurance of your race cars as you plot the strategy for a team of race cars.  Winning a race requires a combination of speed, tactics, planning and skill.  You will have to play the right tactics at the right time to improve your track position.  Each race car driver needs to decide if they should throttle back and save fuel, or scorch their tires making a charge to the front.  Will you risk a wreck, or play it safe?  Will you try a bold fuel strategy, or pit with the rest of the field?  3-Wide puts you in the driver's seat, and on the crew chief's pit box!&#10;&#10;Each tire of each car has four levels of wear.  These tire wear levels in turn determine the custom colored dice that you will roll to determine the speed of your car.  As the team owner you have a hand of tactic cards which can be played on behalf of your team cars.  Successfully playing tactics is dependent upon the location of other cars around your car, and the timing of when the tactic cards are resolved.  Driver skills are precious resources that can be used to avoid a nasty situation on the track, or to exploit an opportunity on pit lane.  Pit stops become necessary as your tires wear away, and as your fuel gauge is nearing empty.  Planning a good fuel strategy can be vital.&#10;&#10;Eighteen different race tracks are modeled in terms of configuration, braking zones, tactical card deck composition, tire wear, and fuel consumption.  Each track also features two different race lengths so you can play a short game or a long one.&#10;&#10;Winning is everything, but if you don&rsquo;t come across the line first maybe you can console yourself with how well your team did overall.  You can also string together a series of races and have a championship season!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Safe Breaker (a.k.a. Merkurya) is a simple-to-learn game of memory and deduction! The game consists of 12 objects: six showing colors and six showing numbers. (In the original version of the game, these objects were cards; in newer versions, they're castle towers that stick together magnetically.)&#10;&#10;Each player receives one color and one number, keeping these values secret since they form that player's combination. Play starts with one player asking the player to the left if they have a certain color and number. If they have either of those values, they say &quot;yes&quot; and they become the next player; otherwise they say &quot;no&quot; and the question passes to the next player to the left to answer.&#10;&#10;When a player thinks they know an opponent's combination, on their turn they can name that player's color and number. If the guess is correct, that opponent is out of the game and the player gets another turn &mdash; but if they're wrong, they are out of the game instead and the wrongly accused opponent now has the next turn.&#10;&#10;As far as the rules go, that's it! How much do you talk to your opponents? Do you keep quiet or suggest questions for them to ask? Do you remind them who answered what, and if you do, did you remember correctly?! Are you spinning disinformation?&#10;&#10;",

To put a new tile to your mark, you buy it from the market.

The tile may be put to your mark only if you have matching trading symbols on both tiles (supply chain monastery/farm-village-city-castle). If a tile has neighbors all around, you get the according victory points.&#10;&#10;As an alternative, you can choose to draw two new tiles from the pile and offer them in your track of the market. Since you are not allowed to buy tiles in such turn, you must decide whether to make them expensive and hope that you can afford them on your next turn &mdash; or to make them cheap and take the risk that others buy them before you have the chance to do so.&#10;&#10;Final scoring includes bonus points for most tiles of each type of building and money as well as non-finished buildings (half the value).&#10;&#10;",

A player will be the counter.&#10;A card is placed away. &#10;A player of each team will go to see the card, return to his place an take a block to start building the structure, This must be done before the counter gets to 10.  Then a another player from each team will do the same and so on until a team agree that they correctly built the structure calls out  &ldquo;Mental Blox!&rdquo;&#10;Check the team&rsquo;s structure against the card.  If he team built the structure correctly, they can  keep the card. If they built the structure incorrectly, see if the other team came closer to re-creating the structure; if so, that team keeps the card. Continue playing for three rounds.&#10;&#10;Game 2: Listen &amp; Build;;&#10;In this game, you&rsquo;ll have one caller and two builders.  Divide blocks so that each player has an identical  set of 10 blocks.  The caller should take a card and, with his or her back to the builders, describe the  structure to the builders.  After the caller finishes describing the structure and the builders complete their re-creations, compare the card to the structures. Which builder came closest to re-creating the picture with blocks? The most accurate builder can keep the card. Continue playing for three rounds.&#10;&#10;Both games have a variant where players should answer the bonus question on the bottom of the card.&#10;&#10;",

Game turns quickly become combat events, with the outcome in doubt and usually dependent on the entrance of the United States into the fray, ending a long and bitter back-and-forth stalemate.&#10;&#10;The active player always rolls two red dice. He/she will roll one or more four white dice along with the two red dice after he has cards with at least three dice icons, rounded down, in front of him. At the start of the game each player has a card with a half-die in front of him. He or she will therefore need to get cards into the war with two-and-a-half more dice icons to be able to roll a total of three dice (two red and one white).&#10;&#10;If the red dice total matches the entry number of one of your nation&rsquo;s cards it enters the war and its dice icon(s) will be available to you on your next turn. To score a hit (i.e., win a battle), you must roll a 5 or 6 on a white die. If you do, move the token one space toward you on the Tug of War track. Move the token to your &quot;Win&quot; space and you win the game.&#10;&#10;Sometimes you'll have to choose between the red and white dice result, and when one player can roll all six dice, the end of game sequence will trigger.&#10;&#10;Not my best work. I wish I could get BGG to remove it.&#10;&#10;",

A group of friends gets together to make a &lsquo;cal&ccedil;otada&rsquo;, a Catalan food feast. One of them sets a challenge to see who can cook and eat more cal&ccedil;ots before the ingredients are gone. Now, you&rsquo;d better take care that they don&rsquo;t trick you!&#10;&#10;Cal&ccedil;ots may be eaten when you complete a series with the following card order: wood, fire, grid, cal&ccedil;ot, sauce. The value of each card must be equal or less than the previous one so that it makes sense. To obtain an ingredient you can draw it from the pile or from another player&rsquo;s hand.&#10;&#10;In this simple game, you can deduce other player&rsquo;s strategy but you are always called to attack. It may seem crazy but eating has never been funnier. It is said you shouldn&rsquo;t play with food, but this is the exception. With Cal&ccedil;otada Wars let&rsquo;s play dirty to win.&#10;&#10;",

Your duty is to lead your men on a variety of randomly generated missions (representing orders direct from high command), choose weapons and equipment that are best suited for the mission, decide on how to posture your team, plan your approach, and a method of extraction.&#10;&#10;However, it is not quite that simple; you must choose weapons and equipment that do not expose your team, and do not cause unintended escalation (if the US military must divert regular combat units to your area to quell enemy activity, the value of the Green Berets will be called into question by the &ldquo;traditionalists&rdquo; at the Pentagon); Your goal is to disrupt the enemy&rsquo;s freedom of action in your area of operations with a minimal &ldquo;footprint&rdquo;, and minimal cost.&#10;&#10;Modern War #18, Jul-Aug 2015.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In Mangrovia, a light &quot;gamer's game&quot;/family game with a Caribbean mangrove setting, a clever role selection mechanism allows the players to choose two different bonuses/actions as well as the turn order in which they want these actions to be carried out &mdash; all by placing just one marker. Victory is achievable through a number of viable options, which guarantees high re-playability.&#10;&#10;The game is a fight over acquiring the best locations for your huts in this appealing and unspoiled landscape. If you manage to do so, you will become the rightful successor of the old chief and win the game. You gain Chief points by having the most huts (and the secondmost huts) along each of the eight divine paths monitored by the statues of Gods. Additional Chief points are earned by controlling sacred locations, by collecting amulets, and simply by building huts at lucrative spaces.&#10;&#10;Building a hut requires that the space's landscape is &quot;active&quot; and that you can pay the exact price (not overpay) for the space. Therefore, the game feels tight even from the very start. The game gets tighter and tighter towards the end of the game as you have fewer choices of spaces, and as the actions you choose become more and more crucial.&#10;&#10;In order to succeed in this game, you should carefully choose and time the best possible combination of actions, called &quot;ritual sites&quot;. A boat goes from ritual site to ritual site, first on the west side, then on the east side (in opposite order), triggering each action. If, for instance, you choose a ritual site high up, you will have an early choice of cards, but a late choice of space to build your huts or to collect amulets (and vice versa). A fourth action type is to select &quot;active landscapes&quot; and become starting player, which makes it possible to control the next round. After all players have performed two actions, the round ends. The game is usually played over 10-14 rounds and ends when one player builds his last hut.&#10;&#10;Collecting amulets may be key in this game. Instead of keeping them as Chief points, you may use them to build huts on designated spaces which require payment in amulets instead of cards &mdash; and still to the exact price. Building huts on such spaces may be exactly what you need to get the majority along one or two divine paths. In order to gain enough amulets &mdash; and amulets of the appropriate values &mdash; you should position some of your huts on amulet spaces. The more huts you build on such spaces, the more amulets you can draw. The probability of getting the amulets you need will therefore increase.&#10;&#10;The game board is built as a matrix system, with some spaces being part of two divine paths while other spaces belong to just one. The spaces that are part of two divine paths are obviously most tempting, but can you afford to build your huts there?&#10;&#10;",

They will lead you toward either fortune or disaster &mdash; and thankfully no matter what course of action they take, if you don't agree with their choices, you can always start a mutiny and become the next captain yourself...&#10;&#10;Each turn, the captain chooses a destination for the ship, a target that it will attack. Once the ship is attacking, the players (more or less!) co-operate to defeat their victim, then they divide the treasure amongst themselves &mdash; but your gold is never secure until you bury it on Treasure Island.&#10;&#10;As you carry out the attack, unrest is always brewing in the kettle. Each time the captain makes a choice, it's possible for one of the other players to call &quot;Mutiny&quot; and try to overthrow them to become the new captain. And when the mutiny begins, you need to decide how to use your cards during the mutiny and the looming battle. How much will you co-operate when you assault an enemy, and what will you keep to yourself to prepare for when the next mutiny starts?&#10;&#10;As is fitting for a pirate, your greatest desire is for gold, and you'll do anything to reach your goal. In the end, whoever collects the most gold becomes the richest pirate in Tortuga!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In 1914, the great powers of Europe could not save the international system that had been in place since Metternich a century before. Tangled alliances pushed them to the brink. Nations miscalculated and expected a short, limited war, but a four-year World War blew up in their faces and forever changed the continent and the world.&#10;Great War Commander traces the war as the nations and empires fought it on the western front across Belgium and northern France. The forces of three major powers-France, Germany and America- all have forces in the game. One player handles Germany while the other side commands either France or America.&#10; Great War Commander (GWC) is a wargame based on the popular Combat Commander series created by Chad Jensen where two players take turns playing &ldquo;Fate cards&rdquo; in order to activate military units on the mapboard. GWC offers many new and unique elements to its parent system. The maps are deeper, allowing more playing surface to maneuver two battalion-size forces facing each other. There are several new orders, like Offensive, Runner, and Machine Gun Suppress, all reflecting the intense and blinded combat. There are over 30 actions including Engineering works, Go to Ground, and Rolling Barrage, highlighting earthen ties and powerful artillery. And there are 40 events dealing with experiences unique to the times, such as Tanks and Sturmtruppen. Among the new and many contemporary events are Trommelfeuer, High Command Meddling, Petard Raquette and Machine Gun Nest.&#10;&#10;Great War Commander puts emphasis on the rigid top-down field command structure of the period with captains giving orders to lieutnants and NCOs which is new to the system. Besides the Fate Cards, there are Strategy Cards which factor in higher command and give a flavor and depth to the battles beyond that of the tactical level.&#10;&#10;Players already familiar with the Combat Commander system will find a ready path to learning Great War Commander, at the same time discovering the one-off experiences of the Great War. There are some trenches to be sure, but there are many open field battles too. Barrages can alter terrain. Gas attacks can flood a sector. Air dominance or reconnaissance can influence the fighting.&#10;&#10;Stand with the French at Verdun. Charge forward with the Germans in Belgium and at the Marne. Follow the Americans as they slug their way into and through Belleau Wood. GWC offers sixteen historical scenarios including one introductory scenario for players not yet familiar with the general game system, a three players scenario and four scenarios with tanks. The replay value is high and the dedicated Random Scenario Generator adds endless hours of play. Hexasim will expand GWC in upcoming sequels covering British, Russians, Austrians, Turks and Great War actions in Africa .&#10;&#10;",

The higher the rank of the title associated with the position, the more country cards required. Already-occupied positions can be contested by playing intrigue cards.&#10;&#10;The game proceeds over three periods, with a scoring taking place after each of them. During scoring, the players with the greatest influence in each of the four countries score victory points. After the third period scoring, the game ends with the scoring of the individual titles.

The red die is for moving the Maik-and-Maik token, from the white dice the active player selects one result for him/herself and moves his/her token accordingly, then the other players chose the remaining dice results.&#10;The racing track contains shortcuts and spaces on which an effect card has to be drawn. Most of these have negative effects (having to move back, changing place with the last player etc.). Other spaces get you a heart token and allow all other players to look at one of the movie cards. Remembering which movie card is where allows players to take shortcuts.&#10;Heart tokens can be used to allow players to move fewer spaces than the die roll dictates, to turn over an additional movie card when trying to take a shortcut, or to ask other players for help with finding the right movie card.&#10;&#10;",

They built cities and moved mountains at his command, for fear of his angry gas!&#10;&#10;But man is mortal, and even the life of Suleiman must come to its end. Powerful genies scatter &mdash; some go to the Netherworld of Order, others to the Netherworld of Chaos  &mdash; but the disciples of the great master remain, and they hope to subjugate the servants of their master again. Each of them has created carpets filled with secret magic and sent them out to gather the scattered genies.&#10;&#10;Your goal in Ifrito is to be the first player to capture nine of his opponent's genies or three of his opponent's carpets.

Designed for seven to seventeen players, in Mafia: Vendetta some players take on the roles of Mafia members, others become the civilians of a crime-filled community. Every night the Mafia kills another person, every day the civilians have a chance to discuss the murder, choose suspects, and condemn one of them to death. Since every role is secret, you never know who is an innocent bystander, and who is part of the Mafia. If the Mafia kill off enough civilians, the community becomes a permanent haven for crime, but if the civilians rid their community of the Mafia, they win.&#10;&#10;Mafia: Vendetta offers eleven different civilian roles and five different Mafia roles. It also features two different alternative modes, the Loner mode and Yakuza mode, that each introduce a third faction to the game. You might play a Mafia Thug, a protective Nurse, an innocent Bystander, or a cunning Imposter. No matter what your role, play it convincingly, make your choices carefully, and trust no one.&#10;&#10;",

The results chart also shows results with either a black or white dot which accounts for fumbles or interceptions and break away touchdown runs or passes.

Other cards allow you to manipulate the cards in front of you and others.&#10;&#10;As soon as only one player is left or the stack runs out, the game ends.

If you land on a monster, use the Monster cards to find out how tough it is, then roll a dice and use your Treasures (like Protective Kittens or a Broccoli Smoothie &ndash; EEEUUWW, YUCK) to beat it. When you run out of Treasure cards, whoever has the most gold in their hand wins the game!&#10;&#10;",

The Union sends their most brilliant leaders, ready to hammer out a contract that will mean tranquility and prosperity for years to come.  But as the meetings are about to commence, the Imperium fleet arrives and bombards New Mars to a fine powder, evacuating Imperium leaders just before the destruction.  War immediately erupts in star systems far and near, and the Imperium circles the chaos like a vulture, snatching up planets and enticing new allies to join them.  The Union quickly gathers its forces as princes and vice-presidents take the helm in the sudden power vacuum left from the attack at New Mars. Will they be able to stand against the growing storm that the Imperium commands?&#10;&#10;War of the Void pits two teams of players against each other in a struggle to control the galaxy through conquest or diplomacy.  Each player controls his own alien empire, building up a deck of cards unique to his alien faction to perform actions.  Players on the same team complete their turns simultaneously, resulting in action-packed, quick gameplay.&#10;&#10;Players must work together to dominate systems by taking control of planets.  Planets can either be conquered, which will increase a player&rsquo;s income, or befriended, which will give the player a special ability.  Players must build up a fleet of ships to defend and attack, choosing from many ship types with unique abilities.&#10;&#10;War of the Void is a thematic sequel to Empires of the Void.  It in an entirely new game set in the same universe. The game is for 2-4 players and takes about 90-120 minutes to play. A planned expansion will add components for a 5th and 6th player.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Ten assassins gathered in one resort. Only one gets to be called the Number One Killer. Enough said.&#10;&#10;Hitman Holiday is game of deduction and strategy where as many as up to ten players take on the roles of ten of the deadliest assassins mankind has ever known. Gathered at the world's most beautiful resort, otherwise known as Paradise, they are out to play a game of death in a bid to eliminate competition in business as well as claim the much coveted title of Number One.&#10;&#10;A truly unique game, one may say it is what happens when Cluedo meets Battlestar Galactica meets Werewolf. The game begins with each player having a secret target to assassinate. The fun part is that the targets do not know yet which player is targeting them. This means that while you are trying to find a way to secretly kill off your assigned target, somewhere out there among the players is also someone trying to kill you, and it is up to you to find out who before it is too late! This is all done at the resort, which provides a ton of ways to kill someone, such as shoving them off a balcony, or dropping that accidental flower pot from three stories above. The game also takes on a different angle from the generic James Bond killer image, presenting its killers from all walks of life, even including old women and innocent looking young ladies. Instead of purely guns, they also use almost anything around the resort, turning innocent objects into lethal weapons.&#10;&#10;There are hidden actions, and the need to deduce who is killing who based on clues that drop now and then. Observing how each player behaves on the board also gives away clues sometimes as to whether or not they are your assigned killer. This is and will always remain the very FIRST game from Medieval Lords, and one that has taught the studio a ton in terms of experience and execution.&#10;&#10;WARNING: Due to the large number of players the game can go up to, you might have to expect a longer downtime than the average game!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Burger Dice is a casual press-your-luck dice game for 2 or more players ages 8 and up. A game lasts between 15 and 20 minutes. Players take turns rolling dice and making burgers with their ingredients based on a set of simple rules. Score points for dice you play but be careful: waste too many ingredients and you&rsquo;ll get kicked out of the kitchen! Be the player with the most points at the end of the game to be declared the Chef de Burger!&#10;&#10;Whoever ate a burger most recently goes first. Players take turn rolling 3 dice at a time and placing them in burgers based on a set of simple rules (must have buns, no duplicate ingredients, etc.). You get to score points for completed burgers when you end your turn. Any die you cannot play is considered waste and moved to your waste pile. If at any time you have 4 or more waste dice your turn is immediately over and you score no points.&#10;&#10;The game is driven by the custom dice, each one featuring 2 buns and 4 ingredients (burger, pickles, ketchup, and cheese). Using these with the burger building rules the players make their rolls and place the resulting ingredients to create burgers. Players can stop any time they want (before rolling) and score points for their completed burgers (1 point per die) or they can keep rolling and risk losing it all!&#10;&#10;",

Now you too can recreate the exploits of pirate captains or the naval commanders that hunted them.&#10;&#10;Whether you want skirmish between crews on uncharted islands and in the alleyways of Caribbean ports or ship-to-ship duels that culminate in bloodthirsty boarding actions, the rules offer a quick-to-learn basic game. These small forces of buccaneers, commanded by captains and kept in line by trusted lieutenants, can also be sealed up with ease for larger engagements.&#10;&#10;Gameplay centers on two driving motivations that epitomize the pirate life - Fear and Greed. Cunning captains will have to balance these two elements, instilling fear in their opponents with bloodthirsty reputations, while keeping their own crews in line with the promise of loot and wealth&#10;&#10;",

Action cards and team placards have unique actions and abilities.&#10;&#10;The Collector's Edition box also has an Embossed foil stamp on the cover and is signed and numbered.  There will only be 300 units of this version ever manufactured.&#10;&#10;&#10;In Thrash-Car, you build your racing team from the ground up. As the team owner, you choose your crew, car, and strategy, then help them drive their way to victory in some of the wildest and toughest race conditions you have ever seen.&#10;&#10;Each driver is trying to get around the track and survive it. The track is made of random cards drawn from the track deck, and each card has a target attribute, a target number, and a damage value. The attribute determines that base attribute from your car you are using to build your base roll modifier. The target number is the number you have to roll on a ten-sided die or greater to succeed and move to the next track space. Damage is how much damage your car takes if you fail your roll.&#10;&#10;When you go to move, the other drivers can play up to one card on your action stack (this is the screw your neighbor part). The draw deck plays one card, then you can play up to two on yourself. These cards will result in a modifier for your roll to move. You add or subtract that number from your car's base and roll the die. If you make the target you move ahead and keep racing; if you fail you take the listed damage and try to keep racing. Fail too many rolls, and your car will be destroyed. You are always trying to get ahead and your friends are always trying to drag you down.&#10;&#10;At times, the drivers can beat on each other with their cars and roll head-to-head to see who is better in these exchanges, but if you get outrolled you can take some serious damage. If you do the outrolling, though, you can hammer the other guy and leap ahead in the race.&#10;&#10;You win Thrash-Car by being the first to complete the designated laps or being the last car running on the track.&#10;&#10;",

Preparing and presenting a beautiful matcha (tea) for your guest is the ultimate expression of culture, ceremony and respect.&#10;&#10;In Matcha, players attempt to collect the utensils (chadogu) they need to perform a tea ceremony by matching tea ceremony (otemae) cards on the table by either their number (1-4) or suit (tea, water, bowl, &amp; scoop.) Cards are played secretly, and sometimes it will be to your advantage not to match at all.&#10;&#10;With just 18 otemae cards and an assortment of chadogu tokens, Matcha provides plenty of strategy for players who must decide when and where to play their cards to the table.&#10;&#10;Game #4 in 'The Mike Line' of games from Grail Games.&#10;&#10;",

Once all of the players' Hustlers are placed, each player, in turn, then activates one space and performs the actions which that space allows. Each corner allows players to sell one drug based on the icon shown, and may roll the Dope Dice (3 custom dice) in which depict a different drug on 4 faces (Weed, Meth, Coke, Heroin), a wild card on the fifth face, and finally, an arrest warrant on the sixth. For each face rolled players may sell one matching drug token.&#10;&#10;If 2 gangs occupy a corner, the person who activates the corner initiates a robbery. No matter who wins, someone's going to the Emergency room, with one Beat Down token for each opposing Hustler that robbed him.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each round, a card is drawn and has either a persistent effect which lasts the entire round or a one time effect, as well as that night's prices to buy and sell drugs.&#10;&#10;At the end of a set amount of rounds, the richest gang wins.&#10;&#10;",

The one or two werewolves try to keep their identity a secret so that no one identifies them; the humans must kill one werewolf or else their town is overrun and they lose.&#10;&#10;Each player secretly gets a role card (with two role cards placed in the middle of the table), looks at it, then closes their eyes to represent nighttime in town. One player is the game's moderator and calls out the roles in order for the players to take actions. The werewolves and the CIA Agent(s) open their eyes to see who belongs to these groups, but they can't say anything! Thus, a lone CIA Agent learns who the werewolves are, but he can never reveal his identity when trying to communicate this information to others. The werewolves, on the other hand, might not be sure who is actually on their side. And of course some cards might be out of play in the center of the table!&#10;&#10;The psychic then gets to look at one player's card or both cards in the center of the table. The ninja gets to exchange his card for someone else's, looking at the new card if he swaps. The madman doesn't take an action at night; he just wants the werewolves to win!&#10;&#10;During the day phase, players discuss who the werewolves are (or if there even are werewolves). Then all players vote simultaneously for a player. The player with the most votes is killed. If at least one werewolf is killed, the human team wins; if no werewolf is killed, the werewolf team wins.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "INTRODUCTION: Trench War is a solitaire game of Combat in the muddy trenches in France or Belgium during World War I. The player assumes the role of a commander of an Infantry Platoon during its grueling and miserable turn in the Trenches before they are relieved. As the Platoon Leader, you are responsible for securing your Sector of Front by successfully taking enemy positions and defending yours with the least amount of casualties. Although there are many support units available to you, they may often times be limited to you by political, logistical or geographical obstacles.&#10;&#10;GAME OBJECTIVE: The objective of Trench War is to successfully survive a Tour in the trenches along the Western Front during World War I. A Tour consists of a number of Rotations in the Trenches. The Player can play a Short Tour (1 Rotation), an Average Tour (2 Rotations) or a Long Tour (3 Rotations). Each Rotation consists of making a Rotation Deck of 20 &ldquo;Trench War&rdquo; Cards and once all Trench War Cards have been drawn and resolved, the Rotation is over and the Player totals his Rotation VP and adds it to his Tour VP. Once all Rotations have been completed, the Player totals his Tour VP and then compares it to the Victory Determination Table to determine the level of success.&#10;&#10;GAME FEATURES: Trench War features plenty of colorful Game Counters, Map and Battle Mat, used for resolving Combat. The Game provides plenty of grim themes associated with the War in the Trenches. Counters include Infantry Soldiers, HMGs, Flamethrowers, MK-IV Tanks, A7 Tanks, FT-17 Tanks, Pillboxes, Aircraft, Sub-Machineguns and Light Machineguns.&#10;If you enjoy movies like &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;, &quot;The Lost Batallion&quot;, &quot;Sergeant York&quot;, &quot;Westfront 1917&quot; or World War One in general, you will enjoy this game.&#10;&#10;",

Steal a Card: Go Trick or Treating and pick a random card from the player&rsquo;s hand to your right.&#10;&#10;2. Play a Card: Play a card trying to win that round's treat!&#10;&#10;3. Draw a Card: All players will always have 13 cards in hand.&#10;&#10;To win the game, you total up points earned from Trick cards as well as leftover candy (which is worth 50%, since it&rsquo;s now &quot;stale&quot;). The person with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

If they find a match, they use their marker to claim it.  If someone else's marker is already there they knock it off.  Players try to claim as many tiles as they can and when the timer runs out whoever has their marker on a tile gets to collect it.  Player with the most tiles at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Palaces is a deck-building bidding game in which you win cards and build towers.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the active player chooses to draw from one of three stacks of cards, then all players bid or drop out. There is only one round of bidding per card. Bids are valued based on the size of a suit (e.g., three-of-a-kind beats two-of-a-kind, etc.), and if the size matches, you compare suits: Gold, Silver, Crystal, Marble. If size and suit match, compare a secondary bid (3 gold and 2 marble beats 3 gold and a silver).&#10;&#10;The highest bidder activates the card's special effect and adds it to their discard pile. (Eventually it returns to their hand and activates again when in a winning bid.) The winner of the bid also gets to add a room to one of their two towers, while the other players draw cards. Play proceeds clockwise.&#10;&#10;Each player's two towers must match one another. The winner is the player with the tallest lower tower.&#10;&#10;Unlike most deck-building games, you do not void your hand after your turn. Players who win bids discard their bids to build their towers, while other players draw cards.&#10;&#10;",

The instructor has rigged three training bombs for you and your team to defuse, but little do you know that there is no way to actually defuse them! The bombs will explode eventually, and if you want to graduate at the top of the class then you&rsquo;ll want to cut high-value wires without triggering the explosives! Grab your wire cutters and steady that shaky hand, because it&rsquo;s going to be an explosive night!&#10;&#10;In Bomb Squad Academy there are four decks of cards representing the four &ldquo;wires&rdquo; of the bomb, and a trigger track next to each deck. Every round, each player secretly decides (then simultaneously reveals) the wire that they will cut this round (or perhaps they&rsquo;ll chicken out, or even call &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; preventing a wire from being cut). After actions are revealed, the chosen wires are &ldquo;cut&rdquo; by flipping cards from those decks. When a card is flipped, its value dictates how far the trigger moves down the trigger track and how many points are earned; cutting wires alone is worth a lot more than cutting the same wire as other players. Push the triggers too far and the bomb will explode! Whoever causes the bomb to explode loses points. Players earn useful Tools during the game that they can use to break the rules. Get through three gruelling bombs with the cleverest cuts to finish your final exam with the most points!&#10;&#10;",

One minute before close, the door swings open. Outside, you see parked school buses and a line of people all the way to the street corner! The high school girl&rsquo;s volleyball tournament has just gotten out, and everyone is craving a smoothie for the ride home. Becca cuts a deal: whoever blends the most smoothies tonight gets free smoothies for a month!&#10;&#10;The Blend Off has begun, and only one can win. There&rsquo;s just one problem: Kevin. Skittish at best on normal days, he flies into a frenzy, grabbing fruit for you from the fridge at random. Grab the fruit, complete the Orders, and blend your way to victory!&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Overview&#10;&#10;Blend Off! is a game of skill and speed for two to four players from designer Scot Eaton. Master Mixers roll the die (Kevin) to collect fruit to fill Orders from the deck (Becca). When a Master Mixer's fruit matches the Order, they can blend the ingredients and claim the Order for gold stars. There are no turns; everyone plays at the same time in a race for the finish. The winner is the player with the most gold stars at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Gameplay&#10;&#10;The actions the player may take at any time are: Collect, Blend, Dump, and Blunder.&#10;&#10;Collect - Roll your die to send Kevin to the fridge for fruit. You may take one of the fruit from the table and put it on one of your Blenders. You don&rsquo;t have to take the fruit; you may reroll the dice until Kevin brings you what you want.&#10;&#10;Dump - You may dump the fruit out of one of your Blenders. Because the fruit is already mixed together, you may not dump just one or two ingredients; you must dump the whole Blender. You may, however, choose to dump one Blender into another, combining ingredients.&#10;&#10;Blend - When the fruit in one of your Blenders matches the recipe on one of the faceup Orders, shout out &ldquo;Blend!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Blunder - If you catch another player make a mistake like calling &ldquo;Blend!&rdquo; with wrong or extra ingredients in their Blender, shout &ldquo;Blunder!&rdquo; They must correct their mistake by dumping their Blender and, returning the Order card for their botched recipe to Becca&rsquo;s deck.&#10;&#10;",

Each player has to plan and conform to every situation and control a team that they assembled, while their goal is to kill the enemy forces. One big advantage of the game is that every match is different, because the war maps, units, and cards all guarantee a variety of gameplay for unlimited replayability!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In The Staufer Dynasty, the players are nobles in the 12th century, accompanying Henry VI on his tour of the areas of Europe brought under control by the Staufer family, an area that included much of modern-day Germany, from the Baltic Sea in the north to Sicily in the south. You're eager to improve your own lot in the land by placing envoys and nobles in positions of power in the six regions represented in this game.&#10;&#10;The game lasts five rounds with each player having three actions per round. Players take actions in order of their family members on the action board from top to bottom; on a turn you either take a supply action (moving to one side of the action board) or a move/deploy action (moving to the other side).&#10;&#10;For a supply action, you pick one of the spaces on the supply table, move the indicated number of envoys and nobles from the province to your personal court, then claim any chests underneath that space. The treasure chests come in different colors, with each color having a different function in the game: the brown treasure chests score points based on how many you collect, the orange ones provide immediate points or figures, the blue ones provide a one-shot bonus, and the purple ones let you collect one of the privilege cards on display. The privilege cards often modify other actions or give you a bonus for doing a particular thing.&#10;&#10;For a move/deploy action, you decide which office seat you want to occupy in a particular region. If this seat isn't in the region where the king is located, you need to spend one envoy as you move clockwise away from the king, placing each envoy in the top part of those regions, until you reach the region that you want to occupy. You then pay the cost of the office seat, placing one figure &mdash; possibly a noble if the seat demands it &mdash; in that seat and all the other figures in clockwise order, one per region. When you occupy a seat, you claim the chest underneath it.&#10;&#10;After everyone has finished their actions, you score for the round &mdash; but you score only in the region indicated in the current row of scoring tiles (Aachen, Nijmegen, Palermo, etc.) and the region that best meets the condition laid out in a separate part of the current row of scoring tiles (fewest chests, most occupants, where the king is located, etc.) If these two regions turn out to be the same one, you score that region only once. Players score points for having the most office seats in a region (or the second- or thirdmost most office seats) based on the point tile placed in the region at the start of the game. Each region also has a printed bonus that players receive, such as bonus chests or additional envoys.&#10;&#10;To end the round, you remove all of the office occupants of the region that scored, add new chests under each office seat in those scoring regions and each space on the supply table, then sweep the king clockwise 1-3 regions. As the king moves, he returns all of the envoys that he encounters in the regions that he enters to their owners. After five rounds, players score for their treasure chests as well as for how well they completed their secret job cards, and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

By playing a card, the player activates his Sifaka, allowing him traveling through the desert. The movement speed and direction is determined by covering cards. If a player wants to move five fields, they must cover five palms; to change the direction, they need to cover an arrow. If you see a mango symbol mapped on the card, a corresponding mango token will be placed on it immediately. If a player stops their Sifaka on a field with a mango, they collect it immediately.&#10;&#10;Ones all the cards have been played, the game ends, and whoever has the most points on his mangoes wins.&#10;&#10;",

The game is simple: manage cooperation and competition with other players across five releases to score the most points. Each round of Release! is played the same way, but the scoring rules change as you reveal new tools and methods. Your team needs to continuously respond to these strategic shifts in order to produce the best release possible.&#10;&#10;Release's core mechanics are modeled after classic trick trump games. Rounds, or releases, are played by each player contributing a card to a trick, generally the highest card thrown takes the trick. This continues until the players are out of cards, at which point in time they score the release.&#10;&#10;Scoring rules are where it gets tricky.  Every release the players will reveal a new scoring methodology. These scoring rules award or subtract points for taking; various combinations of cards, lump sums of suits, or a specific number of tricks.  This means that some rounds you want may want to lose as many tricks as possible, win as many as possible, or fish for specific cards.&#10;&#10;The face cards lend further complexity, these cards all have special bonus powers that do things like: affect their rank, steal previously won cards, award instant points, and much more.&#10;&#10;The game itself is themed to evoke certain trends of software development. Themeing elements include naming conventions, fun copy, and the face cards are all modeled after famous 'faces' of the development community.&#10;&#10;",

The salvage of a lifetime just drifted into nearby space. Unfortunately, you're not the only salvage crew to respond. Since you all arrive at the derelict together, interstellar salvage laws apply. Within the ship are dangers and rewards alike, just waiting for you.&#10;&#10;In this fast-paced game of risk-taking and decision-making, you and up to four additional players try to claim the most salvage from the derelict ship before its failing engines finally explode. You'll go room to room gathering up salvage and avoiding deadly hazards. Will you get out of the derelict and tuck away your acquired salvage, or press your luck against the growing threat of the deadly hazards?&#10;&#10;This game can be played in under 30 minutes and is simple enough to be grasped by young players. Older players, however, will enjoy it even more as they weigh the odds and make their decisions.&#10;&#10;Each player is a faction that has an immunity, and the push your luck aspect comes from flipping the top card of the deck.  You can get salvage points that are evenly distributed among the players left on the ship and the left over goes to a kitty.  You can also flip over a hazard, which only kills you the second time a hazard of the same type is revealed.  Before you flip the next card, you have a tile that says, stay, or to back to ship. If you go back to ship, you keep the points that you have gathered and take the kitty points.  If you stay, you keep going until everyone dies or leaves for their ship.  There are five stages of the game.  Each stage you also shuffle an artifact and a black hazard which no one is immune to into the deck.  Each faction also has an artifact that will score them 20 points, whereas if you don't get your special artifact, it is only 10 points.  At the end of the five stages, whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Demonslayer: The Siege of Mt. Kunlun is what is called a 'deck-building game,' for up to four players. The game is based on the story &ldquo;Warriors of Magic Mountain.&rdquo; Each player takes control of one Sect of the Kunlun Immortals, and they must compete with each other in defeating the dread forces of the Heart-Eaters. By defeating the Heart-Eaters, each player accumulates Cultivation. At the end of the game, once all the Heart-Eaters are defeated, the player with the most Cultivation is the winner.&#10;&#10;Every turn, players play a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; of cards, building up the player&rsquo;s &ldquo;ready deck&rdquo; and attacking the demon enemies. In each turn, players can &quot;obtain&quot; a card once, and attack once. Players can obtain spells as well as obtain &quot;meditation&quot; cards which are used to obtain more, stronger cards.  Players may also &quot;obtain&quot; Immortal warriors from their Immortal Roster area; Immortals are the foot-soldiers in the war against the Heart-Eaters.&#10;&#10;Each turn of the game is strategically important; one wrongly played hand can mean the difference between first and last place.&#10;&#10;There are four Sects of Immortals in Demonslayer, and each plays differently from each other. The Kunlun Sect excels at bringing high-powered Immortal warriors out quickly, each building on the other&rsquo;s strength. The Qicheng sect is good at calling on reserve Immortals to join the battle. The Kongtong Sect is proficient at Alchemy; creating powerful artifacts which help the Sect in it&rsquo;s battle&rsquo;s against the Heart Eaters. The noble Wuyi Sect Immortal Warriors sacrifice themselves for devastating combo attacks. Every sect also has 1 Sect Leader Immortal, who provides special powers which serve to define how the sect plays.&#10;&#10;The enemy of the game are the &ldquo;Heart-Eaters;&rdquo; demonic warriors who have attained immortality by reveling in lustful destruction and excess. Many of the heart eaters have spiritual parasites &ndash; called &ldquo;Miasma&rdquo; which infect the players after slaying. However, players also sometimes attack &ldquo;Treasure Beasts&rdquo; which can grant players special abilities once they are won.&#10;&#10;In one &quot;wave&quot; of Demonslayer, there are 8 Heart Eaters and one &quot;Overlord;&quot; a leader of that wave of Heart-Eaters. Demonslayer: Siege of Mt. Kunlun is not, strictly speaking, a game of inter-player competition. Players compete with each other to have the honor of being the most successful at protecting the heavens and Earth from the demon hoards. Yet, players are are essentially cooperating to defeat the enemy.&#10;&#10;This English-language version of the game already incorporates one expansion, called The Alchemist's Fortune. In time, we will release new expansions for you to enjoy, incorporating more players, more cards, more options, more strategy, and most of all &ndash; more fun.&#10;&#10;",

If you wait too long, you might get a good purchase price, but only for what little is still left to sell. You can create trade routes with the help of coaches and thus supply distant towns. The player who owns the most money after twelve rounds wins.&#10;&#10;Hellweg westfalicus includes the expansion module &quot;Warehouse and Privileges&quot; for expert players.&#10;&#10;",

The pile you choose will also determine your turn order for the next round.&#10;&#10;Once you've taken a pile you place the cards in front of you for end game scoring. Any DragonFire cards you have acquired give you the ability to flame the villages for control over them (more victory points).&#10;&#10;Since sometimes you may place a card face down, this becomes a game of reading the other players and choosing the right (sometimes poisoned) piles. Do you take that pile with a lot of cards and risk the minus points or just go for the safe face-up treasures?&#10;&#10;There are several types of treasures to collect. You will only score 1 of the types of chests and the others count against you. Some treasures are just straightforward points. Some are even powerful magic items with special abilities.&#10;&#10;",

Each organelle rewards players with either molecular resources or cellular actions. Final scores are based upon the types of amino acids in your Peptide Chain, and the player with the most points at the end of the game wins!&#10;&#10;",
