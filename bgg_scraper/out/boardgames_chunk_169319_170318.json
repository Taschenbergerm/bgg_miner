With few remaining clans battling for complete control of the entire Nation, players must combat one another and conquer enemy castles.&#10;&#10;With a time limit rule set, Edo Jidai games can finish within a set time limit or be played out to each round's end game.&#10;&#10;Similar to Risk, Edo Jidai goes far beyond what a regular game of conquest can offer with its 150+ game cards that bring players into the context and story of each game.  Card play revolves around attack and defense.  Territory cards can be cashed in for armies, however, have duel purpose and can be used  for combat as well.  This makes hording cash-in cards very difficult ensuring game outcomes are different every time.&#10;&#10;Also, a lot of cards can be played at any time in the game (it doesn't have to be your turn), so players are constantly engaged.&#10;&#10;",

The theme, general gameplay, etc., are the same as original Falling.&#10;&#10;From the publisher's website:&#10;&quot;Everyone is falling. And fighting. The object of the game is to hit the ground last. It's not much of a goal, but it's all you could think of on the way down.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;One player deals the cards, while the other players fall. There are no turns; everyone is playing at once. Players can play cards on each other, or on themselves. These cards are called &quot;riders,&quot; and they change how the dealer will deal. A &quot;Hit&quot; means &quot;Give me two cards.&quot; A &quot;Skip&quot; means &quot;Don't give me anything.&quot; And so on. Those Skips come in really handy at the end of the deck, when the dealer starts handing out the Ground cards. Catch a Ground card, and you're dead.&quot;&#10;&#10;Falling is a real-time game, it takes as long to play as it takes to deal a deck of cards at a leisurely pace. You could literally play in less than a minute.&#10;&#10;",

With six actors between the first and last, you get a separation of Six Degrees.&#10;&#10;There are no turns. The game ends when one player has succeeded in completing a six degree chain.&#10;&#10;But it's not that simple...&#10;&#10;Films and Actors each have different point values. The winning player is not necessarily the the first player to achieve six degrees, but the one with the highest value chain.&#10;&#10;Players will find Action cards that can help them or hinder their opponent(s). Maggie Smith might have a Wardrobe Malfunction on the red carpet or &quot;I, Frankenstein&quot; might be voted Best Film.&#10;&#10;Having started his film career in 1978&rsquo;s &ldquo;Animal House&rdquo;, by 2000 actor Kevin Bacon had come to appear in many of the most successful films in the last decade of the twentieth century. Appearing in such films as &ldquo;JFK&rdquo;, &ldquo;A Few Good Men&rdquo;, &ldquo;Apollo 13&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Hollow Man&rdquo;, just to name a few, Kevin Bacon seemed to have worked with just about every other popular actor in Hollywood.&#10;&#10;1993&rsquo;s &ldquo;Six Degrees of Separation&rdquo;, with Stockard Channing, Will Smith, and Donald Sutherland, speculated that every person on the&#10;planet was only removed from another person by no more than six other individuals between the two.&#10;&#10;It didn&rsquo;t take long for a new parlor game to make its way through the L.A. party scene, and eventually into the general population called &ldquo;Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon&rdquo;. Players, starting with Kevin Bacon and another actor from any film that had ever been made, are challenged to create a chain between the two using films in which pairs of actors appear.&#10;&#10;",

This game simulates the campaign at the battalion/division level. Each combat strength point of Divisions/brigades/regiments are represented by standard military unit symbols (with a few exceptions) and each combat strength point is equivalent to one combat maneuver battalion, while units represented by armoured vehicles consist primarily of battalions of tanks (or armoured cars, in the case of the cavalry/armoured car units)(armoured divisions, though having tanks, are still at least half infantry battalion units). The combat system is based on differential, rather than odds, as each combat unit fights one against one as opposed to a hex(es) unit aggregate vs unit aggregate. Corps/army artillery and air are separate components added to combat, as both played an important part in the struggle and really could not be factored into unit value. Gothic Line: The Campaign in Northern Italy &ndash; AUGUST TO OCTOBER, 1944 is a desk top publishing type of game, with a self-sticking countersheet mountable on standard 1/2 inch counters, rulebook, charts, and full color map.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "A Simulation of the Post-Reformation Smack Down!&#10;&#10;The premise behind Spiritual Warfare: Luther's Small Catechism Edition (LSCE) is that there is a very real war that is being waged across the world. Look, you may not think this is your thing. You may be completely unaware of the earth-shattering implications of the Reformation or a guy named Martin Luther. You may not know that there is a legacy of this radical confessing church that exists to this present day. Regardless, this is still a boss game that helps people understand the battle for truth that plays out for every member of planet earth. It is not combat that can be fought and won with worldly weapons. It is a war of words.&#10;&#10;The game is played with each side choosing their champions.  The Enemies of the faith can choose between slick Gurus, irreverent Pagans, boastful Humanists, and wicked Fanatics.  The Defenders of the faith square off against them with wise Mentors, sharp Theologians, courageous Missionaries, and generous Stewards.&#10;&#10;Game play moves through 4 distinct phases: the Draw Stage, the Activation Stage, the Encounter Stage, and the Resource Stage.  Each player uses their champion to make the best on the spot decisions through each individual phase in order to gain the edge and silence their opponent.&#10;&#10;This game can also function as a training tool in connection with Luther's Small Catechism to help students of any age learn the six chief parts of the historic, Christian faith.&#10;&#10;",

For some reason, you've decided that this year will be your big year. You'll explore wonderful habitats on a quest to see as many beautiful birds as you can. But whenever you see a bird, word will get out. Anticipate the crowd to see more birds than anyone else!&#10;&#10;Birds of a Feather is a fast, friendly, easy to learn card game for 1-7 players. The game is easy enough for children to learn and enjoy, but surprisingly strategic, making it a great filler for more hard core gamers.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt a large hand of cards. The game takes place over several rounds. In each round, each player chooses a card to play simultaneously. This determines not only which bird that player sees that round, but which habitat that player visits. Players check off the birds they see on a score sheet, seeing their own bird plus any other birds in the same habitat. Additionally, all birds are available to be seen for an additional round, giving players the opportunity to see rare birds they missed the first time.&#10;&#10;Once all players have played through their hands, scores are tallied based on which birds each player saw. Seeing all birds in a habitat gives a substantial bonus. In the end, whoever saw the widest variety of birds is the winner!&#10;&#10;",

It's Pick Stick Oh!&#10;&#10;Pick Stick Oh! is a new twist on the classic Pick Up Sticks, played with cards rather than sticks.  Players are dealt cards and then take turns tossing them into a pile.  Each card must overlap another card.  After all the cards are placed, each player takes turns trying to take a card off the stack without shifting any other cards sideways (lifting up is okay).  Cards have point values from 1 to 5.  If a player takes a red 2 or 3 successfully, he or she gets another turn.  The player with the most total points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

The main objective of the game isn't to win, but to not be the loser.&#10;&#10;The game 'turn' has 4 parts. First you will receive a call (card) from the previous player, then you can use a rune or viking, and/or pass a card to the next player, ending your turn.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to get 5 different gods in your hand. Having the call (card) of a god in your hand means that the warrior (player) has been recognised by that god. When you have the 5, you should put your cards face-up on the table. The other players should do the same thing, always in the most discreet way. The person to put their cards on their table last, is the loser.&#10;&#10;",

The conversation returned to the weather; It had poured rain throughout the night and Drouot, the commander of the Emperor's artillery was worried about the effect on his guns. Napoleon acquiesced to a delay in starting the attack. This was the first of many fateful decisions to be made on that day...&#10;&#10;Waterloo 200 is a new concept game covering the epic Waterloo Battle fought in Belgium in June 1815.&#10;&#10;Developed on wooden blocks, over a colorful 86x64 cm mapboard, 400g thick.&#10;The over 200 wooden/plastic components have been created by the best Italian artisinal industry and painted &quot;A buratto&quot;, a technique usually adopted for painting car parts and accessories.&#10;&#10;Historical Background&#10;On June 18 1815, Napoleon's Arm&eacute;e du Nord and a coalition led by Wellington, clashed over the plains of Waterloo in Belgium for a decisive battle.&#10;&#10;Waterloo is a game for two or three players, one controls the French Army and the other one/two control the Seventh Coalition.&#10;Although based on history, players in command of the two sides can modify the evolution of the battle and of the history in the Europe of XIX centuries.&#10;&#10;Rules Introduction&#10;The rules are easy - 6 pages - players can start playing the game without too many rules to remember and the game is 5 turn long (90-120 minutes)&#10;Then the 10 Optional Rules provide more specific and detailed rules for an enhanced realism, such as special Cavalry abilities (Charge, Scouting, Impetus), Artillery Bombardment, Retreat, Combined Attack, Morale...&#10;&#10;Scale&#10;A cm is approximately 70 meters.&#10;A turn is 2 'hours' long.&#10;A full strength counter represents a Leader or a Brigade (30-50 guns, 1000 Cavalrymen, or 3,000 infantrymen) depending on the unit's type, training, morale and leadership.&#10;&#10;Fog of War&#10;The game must be played with the Fog of War on (wooden blocks are placed on the map in such a way the opponent player can not see them).&#10;&#10;Language: English, German, French, Spanish and Italian&#10;Genre: Tactic&#10;Turns: Turn-Based&#10;Complexity: Entry Level to Basic, depending on which rules are used&#10;Period: Napoleonic&#10;&#10;Microbadge: &#10;&#10;",

At the end of the game the bee with the most Honey Jars in storage wins the game. If one of the bees manage to get the storage full before everyone else, then that bee wins the game.&#10;&#10;Of course, there are plenty of other surprises on the board, other than Honey Jars. You can discover friends that can help you collect even more honey (Super Bee, Caterpillar) or not so friendly characters like the Drone, who'll make you lose the precious Jars. Sometimes you might find a Spider Web, but don't worry, the spider is nowhere near to harm you. But, you can use its spider web to gather even more honey!&#10;&#10;Try it once and you'll be hooked forever!&#10;&#10;",

You and your friends take the role of Meridia's leaders and vie for economic supremacy through presentation meetings, voting sessions, public opinion polls, unexpected events, and widespread backstabbing.&#10;&#10;The Lord of the P.I.G.S. is a game for 2 to 4 players and takes up to 30 minutes to complete. Each takes up the role of one of the economy's pillars: President of the Republic, Chief Banker, Corporate Director and Energy Tycoon. Each pillar, or Actor, has an associated score, that represents its economic interests. There's a fifth Actor called Social Stability, non playable, that represents the interests of the People.&#10;&#10;The goal of each player is to be the 1st to raise his/her score to 10, winning the game. To reach this goal, they will have to submit and vote Actions that will influence the economy, and thus their scores. But beware! If the score of Social Stability falls to 0 there will be a Revolution, and the player with the lower score wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "You and your fellow engineers are working cooperatively to launch awesome products and grow the user base. In order to successfully launch products, you must develop the necessary infrastructure while keeping an eye on external events, which might help or hinder your efforts.&#10;&#10;Launch &amp; Iterate is a turn based cooperative card game. Tech cards are the primary type of card used in the game. Tech cards enable development of either core infrastructure (e.g. Data Redundancy), or offer one-shot benefits (e.g. Refactor). Tech cards are also used as the primary currency in the game, representing engineering effort required to develop new technology or to contribute to launching new products.&#10;&#10;During the game, players focus on launching 1 or (potentially) more products at any given time. Successfully launching products increases the overall user base (in millions of users) and allows players to shift effort onto new products. Players attempt to maximize the total user base by the end of the game by strategically selecting the right products to work on at the right time. Each product has specific infrastructure requirements which must be met, along with a cost (in Tech cards) which must be contributed by players in order to successfully launch the product.&#10;&#10;On their turn, players may select a Tech card to play from their hand (making sure that all requirements and costs are met), contribute any number of Tech cards from their hand to help launch an active product, and draw new card(s). At the end of each round, players reveal the next Event card, which can either deliver a benefit or incur a penalty, depending on the card as well as the infrastructure levels players have developed. The game is over after 11 events have been resolved.&#10;&#10;A key factor in Launch &amp; Iterate is developing infrastructure across 4 critical technology stacks, (F)eatures, (A)ccessibility, (S)torage, and (T)esting. Each stack is built up over the course of the game, from base level 0 to level 7. Developing infrastructure is critical to successfully launching products, but usually doesn't directly affect the user base. Each stack also offers specific benefits at higher levels, such as reducing or negating negative Event effects, increasing user base, enabling better allocation of resources or increasing development capabilities.&#10;&#10;",

The Gorgangrackles eat the Anglerfin. The Anglerfin eat the Chumtails. The Chumtails eat the Trollsharks. The Trollsharks...well they eat each other. Between the moistened mountains of Bluff and Butte sprawl the villages of the Nautilus, a peculiar race of tentacle-bearded nature-lovers. The villages are said to reside on top of a rare mineral deposit of UnderAether.&#10;&#10;Topside a Cog would give his left leg for a small glimpse of the material. The UnderAether could supply their steam-factories for centuries and here it is resting under the tentacles of water breathers. The Rivalry has been fought for years. Now the famous Gearhead's Brigade has been sent by the High Cog Warden to investigate a strange beacon in the deep dark depths.&#10;&#10;Rivals: Masters of the Deep is a tactical game for two or more players set in the cold dark depths of the Lurk. Players take command of either the Cog or the Nautilus, gather a fighting force and, through wise decisions and strategic moves, destroy the opposition. In Rivals, Cog &amp; Nautilus go head to head on the battlefield. Your team will engage in fast-paced combat and interact with the board itself. The Creatures of the Lurk will come out of hiding, coral will try and eat you, Underwater rip tides will batter you, all as you fend off your opponent.&#10;&#10;To Setup your game you first gather your army by spending Aether. Each model has a cost. You then pay for any abilities or starting equipment you would like your army to have. You then create the &quot;Lurk&quot; Map. The Lurk is where all battles in the base game play out. The Lurk map is made with hex tiles. After setting up the map, including all card decks and dice, you place your units in the starting points. Your teams are now ready to do battle.&#10;&#10;There are two phases for each side, a Movement Phase &amp; an Action Phase. During the Movement phase you may activate up to two hexes worth of models to begin their movement. After all movement is completed the player moves on to the Action phase. Like the movement phase you may activate up to two hexes, same or different, to begin their Actions. In the Action phase each activated model can perform one of four actions or a special action. The basic actions are Attack, Search, Recover or Charge. There are special areas on the map that you can search and explore but be wary because there is usually danger in dark places. The map also contains dangers and difficult terrain including Coral, underwater geysers and much more.&#10;&#10;Turns go back and forth until your opponents hero is destroyed.&#10;&#10;",

Players assume the role of a party of adventurers in an ultra-modern fantasy setting that exists alongside our very own Earth.  During the game, players will experience an in depth, fully narrative-driven adventure that contains over 90 hours of content. Throughout the narrative you and three of your friends will confront real decisions that change the course of the story and its outcome.&#10;&#10;Players will face many dangerous adversaries throughout the story and will take part in heated combat with these foes. Middara features an innovative, dice based combat system for these encounters.  Based on their equipment and abilities, players will have access to unique two-dice combinations that will increase their attack and damage potential in a variety of ways. In addition to numbers, dice have a particular set of symbols on each face that can be spent according to players currently equipped weapons and abilities.  With nine different types of dice, over 110 unique abilities and 150 unique pieces of equipment the possibilities for different character builds are endless.&#10; What makes Middara so compelling is that the outcomes of story decisions and encounters have far-reaching effects that determine how the story moves and resolves. Friends and family might get killed, or they may survive. Maybe the players avoid some problems entirely, only to be faced with a whole new challenge.&#10;&#10;Gameplay Features:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Narrative-driven campaign that contains over 90 hours of content.&#10;    Unique dice-based success system featuring multiple dice that players can upgrade throughout the campaign. &#10;    36 modular map tiles representing different locations in the world, such as magical forests, caves, and swamps!&#10;    A.I. controlled monsters, NPCs, challenges, traps, and other narrative-driven obstacles.&#10;    Campaign character progression via a point buy system allowing players to ditch traditional classes and instead focus on building the character they want to play.&#10;    Over 110 unique Disciplines and over 150 unique pieces of equipment.&#10;    Stand alone scenarios for when you aren't playing with your campaign group, or even when you are!&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The player chooses his crew, allocates points representing pilot/crew abilities, and, having assessed his strengths and weaknesses, chooses his flight path to the target. Tables and tracks printed on the map sheet provide quick access to information needed and action outcomes. Random events are revealed during flight as are encounters with Luftwaffe and Flak. The player is called upon to make life and death decisions every step of the way, in short, managing mayhem. Nothing in the game is scripted. Most missions play in five to 15 minutes. It is as close as you can get to flying over the Ruhr in a Wellington without climbing into a cockpit.&#10;&#10;Published in Paper Wars #79.&#10;&#10;",

A row of goblets sit in the middle of the table, ready to be filled with either wine or poison. Players each take the role of one character but it is only at the very end of a game that they will drink, one from each goblet. During the game, they must play their cards, one each turn, either into the top of a goblet (adding poison or wine to a goblet) or to the bottom of a goblet (bidding on the goblet). Who will fall prey to their enemies and who will eliminate themselves? Only the most intelligent will survive!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Defenders of The Last Stand is a post apocalyptic adventure game by Richard Launius (Arkham Horror, Run Fight or Die, Defenders of the Realm) and Jason Maxwell (Agents of SMERSH, Superhero Solitaire) for 1-5 players set in the Western United States more than 50 years after nuclear war.  Players take on the roles of Defenders of the last known haven for humanity, called The Last Stand. Four outside clans leaders, along with their followers, advance toward the town, and players work cooperatively to defend The Last Stand.  Menacing mutants also roam the desert threatening the city's survival. The game will introduce player character mutations - your character can mutate from travel into irradiated areas. Gameplay will consist of both elements of adventure and conflict resolution, and Defenders of the Last Stand will come loaded with miniatures, including three large sculpted miniatures of the invading Clan leaders as well as their minions - sculpted by Chad Hoverter. The four warrior clans include raiders on bikes and in cars, another group of human amazons that ride large mutated beasts, a third clan consisting of techno savvy, yet criminally insane youths, and finally a large winged creature so mutated that he has lost all traces of his old humanity.&#10;&#10;&quot;Today we discovered a fallen caravan not fifteen miles up dry road. I had been that way to visit Auntie's just recently and there weren't no caravans, fallen or otherwise, there before. This means the Raiders have been circling the last stand for at least the last two weeks. Pepzi asked me to stay a while in case they attack. No more scavenging for now, she said. &quot;Something is brewing. The air hurts my lungs. I see shadows in the hillside.&quot; The air is more dry than usual. My lips have all but cracked off. Doc gives me salve to put on them, but I tell him to keep it for the kids. New families are appearing in Stanfield. It's a good sight to see. We are finally surviving a bit, and bringing kids into this world again. I'm thinking of how in the good book we are told to be multiply. It's God's will, but most would say this land has been forsaken by God, but I'm hoping we can start again. Me, I'm hoping for the best, but my bones tell me there is no best.&#10;&#10;&quot;The Last Stand was known as Stanfield back in the old world, before the great war. While battles raged in the cities across America and the world, as far as we know, some old-schoolers, cowboys, fighters, and drifters came together in this desert to escape the end of the world. The desert was only the safe place and Detroit says it's where a man learns to be a man. Detroit told me that Stanfield changed its name to The Last Stand back then. Cause it was the last fighting chance for humanity. Detroit knows lots of stories. He is old and claims he was alive in those days, 80 something years ago, back when they played something called baseball and Nitena. I don't know what to believe from his mouth, but he is a hoot to listen to. Course, he has been around a long time, changed by the Radiation &ndash; mutated like many folks, but still as human as human can be,  unlike the raiders. Detroit is one of us now. He knows stuff and and we are going to fight tooth and nail against the raiders wanting to take what we worked so hard to build. Rumor is that they have merged, and I reckon they will have to to capture this city. We are bonded together. Even got a little ancient technology and oil. Bad stuff maybe since it is what brought us here. We'll use it carefully.  The Last Stand may be our last hope.  I don't know if there are any other cities out there worth fighting for.&quot;&#10;--Taken from the Journal of Marha Bourne Star&#10;&#10;",

Using the force from the stars, channeled through the star altar, the residents could control time and transform the versatile resource &quot;materia&quot; into anything they wished. You are one of the city builders of Lemuria, and you must fight for control of the altar, sometimes cooperating with others and using your resources to further develop the ancient city &mdash; and you have only one year in which to do it.&#10;&#10;Lemuria &mdash; originally released as &#230;&#152;&#159;&#229;&#136;&#187;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#162;, or &quot;The Star Kingdom Lemuria&quot; &mdash; is at its heart a worker placement, resource management, and area control game. Players try to get points chiefly by converting two types of workers into resources, then using those resources to buy buildings. Points can also be gained by using special cards and by combining them with buildings.&#10;&#10;The game simulates one full year in Lemuria's lifespan, with each of the twelve rounds representing one month, and with harvests on rounds 4, 8, and 12. On their turn, a player must either (1) place workers to &quot;seed&quot; their materia, or (2) harvest resources as a result of prior placements. Players may also choose to use accumulated resources to buy buildings, use accumulated food to &quot;employ citizens&quot; (use special cards), or spend gold to perform extra actions. Citizens can reside in buildings, which gives extra points during the harvests.&#10;&#10;",

Work with other ghosts to combine forces, and scare away the hardiest of hotel patrons to earn upgrades and get even scarier!&#10;&#10;The randomised guest and dice roll mechanic means each round is different from the next, but there&rsquo;s more than luck to winning the game.&#10;&#10;Creepstone Manor has been closed for nearly a hundred years, standing dark and silent above the town of Creepstone, and that&rsquo;s just the way resident ghost Spookie likes it! But now, the manor has been reopened and turned into a hotel for the living. You play the part of one of Spookie&rsquo;s ghostly minions, charged with ridding the house of these warm-bodied usurpers. Use your skills of terror to send them fleeing into the night and win Spookie&rsquo;s patronage. Who will be top ghost?&#10;&#10;The game of Ghostel is made of rounds, and each round is split into a Day Phase and a Night Phase.&#10;&#10;During the day, new people will enter the hotel whilst those who already spent the night and survived will calm down from their twilight visitations. Meanwhile, the ghosts are hiding in the attic, preparing for the next night by buying more Terror Dice, Scare Tactics to improve their scaring and Spookie favours to give those extra little bonuses.&#10;&#10;During the night, the ghosts walk the rooms, using all their creepy tactics to frighten the humans away and show off for Spookie himself. At the start of the night Phase, each player rolls their Terror dice to determine how scary they are for that night. Players can move one room per turn, leaving behind a Terror die as they move. If the total of all dice in a room exceeds the courage of the human in residence of that room, they're scared out of the hotel! Players then score based on who placed the highest scoring dice; however, scoring is graduated so even a single pip die will still score the canny player some victory points.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Lost to history, a new land in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean was discovered by Portuguese sailor Raimundo Peres da Costa at the cusp of the 14th century. The process of merely planning and gaining support to make such a risk-filled journey was a difficult path of its own. Yet, in securing the sponsorship of beloved Queen Isabel of Portugal, Raimundo was able to get the supplies and crew needed to accomplish his dream.&#10;&#10;Players recreate this accomplishment in a game that plays out as a 3-act story. First, draft cards representing people who have evidence of the hidden land and plans to get there, in order to gain sponsorship from 1 of 6 important figures. Second, use the resources from your sponsor to draft cards representing the supplies and crew needed to make the journey. Finally, sail the treacherous seas to discover the &quot;Land of Danger&quot; by using your hand of cards to pay for the costs of the voyage.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is centered around a deck of multi-use cards that will provide different types of help, depending on the stage of the game, random costs incurred while sailing, and the points gained by completing segments of the voyage. While the game is a race to be first to get to the Land of Danger, points are scored along the way for the difficulty of the voyage and the quality of written journals (hidden scoring cards).&#10;&#10;The game is playable solo, and also with 2 to 6 players.&#10;&#10;",

Not only are there furious wasps and bees ready for revenge but also their bear buddies may be casting a covetous eye and trying to snatch each others&rsquo; honey with their bear hands (no pun intended). There are different types of function cards in the game which allow the players to do different things such as finding out what is hidden in the beehives or taking another player&rsquo;s tile. Players can use their memory and deception skills to make full use of the different functions and turn it into a mind game, in which the winner will have outdone the others by tricking their opponents and earning the most honey. At the end of game, players score points for each honey tile that they own. The honey bee and wasps cause no instant harm to the players during the game, however if the players still have them in their baskets when the game ends, they will be penalized. The player with the highest score wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

This set of rules lets players begin their campaigns with small warbands of 10-20 miniatures of any scale and develop their forces over time, building them into armies hundreds strong. A unique system of command points and the need to carefully manage resources or risk becoming vulnerable to counter-attack have to be finely balanced against the need to gain objectives throughout the game, creating a challenging, but enjoyable environment for your armies.&#10;&#10;",

If a snake is hit it have to be anounced and the black marker is placed under the coloured. When the third piece is placed, the players move their snake one step ahead, and the next player goes. When it is your turn you move your snake one space - but you are not allowed to place the head where there already is a black spot.&#10;&#10;The player who get's his snake closed in, or hit in the head is out of the game.&#10;&#10;The game is from the 1950s.&#10;&#10;",

Judas cards cause the drawing player to lose his turn. Devil cards &quot;trap&quot; a disciple card, and must be &quot;cast out&quot; by a card matching the trapped disciple.

Players take turns turning over cards one at a time from the draw pile of 46 bugs and 6 birds.  They score one point for each bug card turned over.  Tbey may choose to end their turn whenever they like.  However, they must avoid turning over one of the bird cards.  If they turn over a bird, it eats all their bugs and their turn ends with no points scored. If a player ends their turn before turning over a bird, they keep their points.  When all bird cards have been turned over, the entire deck is reshuffled.  First player to a predetermined number of points (40 for 2 to 4 players and 25 for 5+ players is suggested) wins.&#10;&#10;",

During the past decades the few remaining survivors are living a harsh life underground.&#10;&#10;Some of them managed to salvage equipment and technology from the fallen civilization and tried to rebuild society as they remembered it. Others had to adapt both their shapes and minds into something new and more suitable for their new environment. There is a constant struggle between the scattered groups of human and mutant survivors, but in the fortified settlements here and there, they manage to live together.&#10;&#10;The game has three modes: &#10;&bull; Tunnel Fever: cooperative scenario for 1&ndash;4 players, where you and your friends have to save the remnants of humankind from a deadly epidemic which is ravaging the population in a world without hospitals and health facilities.&#10;&bull; Tunnel of Power: competitive scenario for 2&ndash;5 players, where you will try to be the first player to open a legendary governmental bunker from the Cold war, full of equipment and supplies, which was discovered only recently.&#10;&bull; Arena mode: a short card battle based on luck and tactics.&#10;&#10;",

Hardy spaceship pilots mine the asteroid belt between Earth and Mars for raw materials. It's a dangerous job, but the rewards are generous as the Colonial Administration needs as much of the precious minerals as they can get to ensure the survival of humanity.&#10;&#10;- - -&#10;&#10;The Belt is a game for two to four players where the objective is to mine as many asteroids as you can and get the rocks back to base before the end of the game. Each player takes it in turns to move their ship towards an asteroid in order to mine it (see Mining). Once the asteroid has been mined the player must move their ship to their base and deposit the asteroid chunks there before moving off to get more asteroids. Beware, though, because pirates roam the Belt and will attack any ship trying to move rocks out of the belt.&#10;&#10;The win conditions can be set by the players. You could create a time-limit with the winner being the player who collected the most asteroids; or the first to get # asteroids wins.&#10;&#10;Players take turns putting all the asteroid counters within the designated 'field', then the three pirate counters are placed in the centre of the board next to each other.&#10;&#10;1D6 die is rolled on each players turn, which provides a random maximum move distance for them that turn. If ships come within 6 hexes of each other or the pirates they may get shot at. Once a player is on the same hex as an asteroid they roll a 1D3 and it takes that many turns to mine it successfully. A maximum of two asteroids can be held by a ship, it must then return to its base to unload.&#10;&#10;Rules for targeting and firing on the other ships creates added tension, and repairs can also be affected but leave the ship vulnerable.&#10;&#10;",

Everything you will need to play the game comes inside a box of Emergents: Genesis.&#10;&#10;In Emergents: Genesis, players take on the role of powerful superheroes&mdash;known in this world as Emergents&mdash;and battle against the other players in the game to be the last person standing.&#10;&#10;Players customize their decks based on four classes of superpowers in a fast-paced game that can be played by two to four players. Designed by Urban Island Games and Top8Magic, Emergents: Genesis introduces innovative, interactive mechanics to the deckbuilding game that will appeal to all fans of both the superhero genre and interactive card games.&#10;&#10;Gameplay Description&#10;&#10;Players are dealt two Emergents face down and choose one of the heroes to start the game with. The object of the game is reduce all of the other players' heroes to zero health by attacking them while also building your deck and customizing your Emergent's superpowers.&#10;&#10;Each player begins with a deck containing nine Skill cards and three Attack cards. Cards that generate Skill are used to purchase additional cards while cards that generate Attack are used to defeat your opponents.&#10;&#10;Each player shuffles their deck and draws six cards. They can purchase basic cards that advance their Emergent's class strategy or purchase more expensive cards that are available dealt face-up from the deck. Cards that are purchased get put in the player's discard pile and whenever a player can't draw a card they shuffle their deck. At the end of each turn, a player discards their hand and draws six cards from their deck.&#10;&#10;As the game progresses, players will ideally create a deck that showcases their heroes' unique abilities and allows them to be the last player standing. While many deckbuilding games are points races, where someone crosses a finish line and wins, Emergents: Genesis requires you to defeat your opponents, which means you can defend yourself if you have purchased the right cards along the way.&#10;&#10;",

Questions are designed to stimulate discussion among family members, and there are two levels--for younger and older children.  If a player chooses not to answer the question or do the action drawn, he or she may go back to the original space and re-roll once.  If the re-roll also results in drawing a card, then the player must do the action on the card or go back to the original space and lose his or her turn.  The winner is the first player to reach the Finish space.&#10;&#10;An advanced game adds a few extra rules, such as spaces where cards may be given to another player and the need to roll the exact number to land on the finish space.&#10;&#10;",

It is an easy and creative way to involve children in learning activities.&quot;&#10;&#10;Domino Discovery Fractions is an educational take on Dominoes, with the added element of requiring players to recognize and match equivalent fractions as well as fractions expressed as numbers and as pictures.  From a total of 40 dominoes, each player is dealt five and one starting domino is placed on the table.  In turn, each player must find a domino with a fraction that matches one end of a domino already in play, and play their domino against that one.  If they have not matches, they must draw from the draw pile until they can play a domino.  Play ends when one player successfully plays all their dominoes.&#10;&#10;In order to play successfully, players must use their knowledge of equivalent fractions (such as 1/2 = 2/4) as well as understanding visual representations of fractions (such as knowing that a picture of a circle with one of three pieces colored in is equal to 1/3).&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Space Station Disaster is a light strategy game. You and your opponents are building a space station by laying out hex tiles. But most of the tiles contain disasters like aliens, radiation, and fire. Your goal is to use matching equipment cards to fix the disasters. If you fix a disaster you get a point. If you don&rsquo;t have the right equipment you&rsquo;ll have to run away or risk being injured and losing points. The game starts off easy but soon you will be cornered by disease and mad robots hoping to draw a teleport tile to escape.&#10;&#10;Through clever tile placement, strategic movement and a bit of luck you try and fix more disasters than your opponents before the space station is finished.&#10;&#10;The game plays in 30-60 minutes depending on the number of players. With a different order of tiles each game you get a unique experience every time.&#10;&#10;",

All players must complete tactical interventions at 8 sites around the Hong Kong region while dealing with catastrophic events. Players can either play for a collective win, working together to beat an ever increasing inequality meter or they can play individually.&#10;&#10;Interventions are created by matching resource cards to icons printed on the site hexes. A player must successfully match three icons or use wildcard resources as dictated by the current round's market situation. Once an intervention is completed, the resources used go into a pile as marked on the board. There are 8 piles that correspond to the sites on the map and another 8 towards the north of the board, corresponding to the development of global inequality.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Set in 8th century Northern Britain, Before Scotland: 750 AD - Kingdoms is a tactical combat deck building strategy game. It is historical in nature with a rich context and set of mechanics drawn from original sources.&#10;&#10;The game begins in 750 AD and lets you play as one of four nations who struggle for supremacy: the Angles, Britons, Gaels, or Picts. After choosing a leader and moral cause that give special abilities to your kingdom, each player draws up to 7 random cards from their Kingdom Reserve deck. They travel through the Environment and scout the Terrain at the battlefield; these are event cards that alter the impending engagement. From the cards-in-hand (i.e. the Warband), each player may select up to 3 Warband Unit cards that face-off with a competing kingdom. After a simultaneous reveal, cards are resolved one-versus-one with additional Supply, Tactics, or Training cards from the Warband that are used to modify the encounter. Winning cards enter the Hoard. Losing cards are flushed into the Barrow. The game ends when the Kingdom Reserves are exhausted and the player with the largest hoard wins.&#10;&#10;This game is targeted at the casual gamer and is a gateway to the more in-depth title Before Scotland: 750 AD - Empires which layers in a working economy and geographic constraints.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Love Letter: The Hobbit &ndash; The Battle of the Five Armies is a game of risk, deduction, and luck for 2&ndash;4 players based on the original Love Letter game by Seiji Kanai. The deck consists of 17 cards, with the Arkenstone being valued #8, Bilbo Baggins #7, and so on down to The One Ring at #0.&#10;&#10;In each round, each player starts with only one card in hand; one card is removed from play. On a turn, you draw one card, and play one card, using the power on that card to expose others and (possibly) knock them out of the round. If you're the final player active in the round or the player with the highest card when the deck runs out, then you score a point. In LL: The Hobbit, The One Ring does nothing during play, but it counts as a #7 when the game ends, possibly leading to a tie should someone else hold Bilbo.&#10;&#10;In addition to the one extra card, LL: The Hobbit differs from the original game in that the Baron (#3) is represented by two separate cards: Tauriel and Legolas. When you use an elf's power to compare cards, Tauriel knocks out the player with the higher valued card while Legolas targets the lower valued card. (This change isn't in the German edition, where Legolas and Tauriel have the same text.)&#10;&#10;Whoever first wins 4-7 rounds, with the number dependent on the number of players, wins the game!&#10;&#10;",

(Starters, A1 and A2, according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR)).&#10;&#10;It is a unique, very complete game that can (and should) be used as a complement to any method (digital or more traditional) that is used in the classroom. Playing the game at home is of course also great fun!&#10;&#10;Especially the oral skills (speaking and listening) are trained in this game that is played in small groups (3 &ndash; 6 players). The game allows a lot of interaction between the players, exactly what we want in foreign language teaching.&#10;The game is also very useful for getting rid of the usual shyness that many learners feel. The game is very challenging and educational.&#10;&#10;The game Bang the Button is, as mentioned above, very complete and includes a variety of aspects, such as:&#10;&#10;     vocabulary&#10;     grammar&#10;     communication&#10;     culture&#10;     movement&#10;     interaction&#10;     constant participation of all players&#10;     a healthy dose of competion&#10;&#10;&#10;",

As the chief of your clan, it's up to you to guide your prehistoric people through the valley: Take advantage of the environment, pick and hunt for food, discover big and safe caverns for the upcoming winter, gather your tribe and discover the valley!&#10;&#10;Sapiens is a short and easy-to-learn tile-placement game that can prove much deeper than it seems for gamers. Each player has a personal game board that represents the valley on which they will play tiles to determine the journey of their tribe through several prehistoric life scenes. Their aim is to gather food points on the plains and in the forests of the valley and to get shelter points for reaching caves in the mountains. A player's turn consists of two steps:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Connect one new tile from the four in his personal pool to the tiles already in play on his board, with connected scenes needing to match. These placements earn food points when a connection is made, earns shelter points when a cave is reached, and sometimes provides a special ability based on the connected scenes.&#10;    Choose a new tile from the five available in a common pool to re-fill his personal pool to four tiles.&#10;&#10;&#10;Sapiens relies on instinctive domino-like mechanisms that are improved by interesting twists:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Laying tiles on personal (modular) game boards brings a bit of a puzzle feel to the game.&#10;     Having two separate scores &mdash; food and shelter &mdash; and knowing that only their lower one matters when determining who wins confronts players with interesting needs and dilemmas.&#10;     Including special powers linked to the eight different scenes represented on the tiles brings a lot of interaction and choices.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Fall too far back and you might not be able to catch up by the end of the race. Waste all your RPMs and Ammo and you may not have them when you need them most. With plenty of surprises around every corner, only the driver who knows how to react quickly&mdash;and carefully&mdash;will head home with a trophy.&#10;&#10;Building on the platform established by Turbo Rally Card Racing, THUNDER TRACK introduces a whole new level of strategy into the mix! Using your own 1:64 scale die-cast cars, race opponents along rally themed card tracks that you create. The cards are expandable so you can challenge unlimited players and build courses as simple or as big as you can imagine.&#10;&#10;On your turn, flip one track card over, and follow the signs as you race through jumps and obstacles toward the finish line&mdash;all while fending off attacks from your opponents. The first player to reach the winner's circle wins one of five trophies&mdash;and an advantage in the next race!&#10;&#10;But don't think for a second that getting to the Winner's Circle is easy. With over 30 RPM (Radical Performance Maneuvers) cards that allow players to boost ahead, burst through obstacles or sabotage opponents, THUNDER TRACK shifts racing strategy into high gear. Whether it's smokescreens and straightaways or pit stops and pace notes, the right RPM combo at the right time will keep your foot on the gas and your opponents off-track.&#10;&#10;If tire spikes and land mines can&rsquo;t seem to keep your fellow racers from taking the top spot in the winner&rsquo;s circle, don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;re also introducing 10 different weapons to choose from. Send your opponents skidding off track with a missile attack or drag them into the dirt and leave them stranded with a well-aimed grappling hook. But, whichever weapon you choose, you&rsquo;ll have access to unique special abilities and features sure to keep your opponents eating your dust.&#10;&#10;Think you've got what it takes to be a Turbo Rally Card Racing Champion? Only the toughest will survive the new THUNDER TRACK...&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Set in 8th century Northern Britain, Before Scotland: 750 AD - Empires is an epic economy-based tactical-combat strategy game. It is historical in nature with a rich context and set of mechanics drawn from original sources.&#10;&#10;The game begins in 750 AD and lets you play as one of four kingdoms who struggle for supremacy: the Angles, Britons, Gaels, or Picts. After choosing a Leader and Moral Cause that give special abilities to your kingdom, each player works through four seasons each year: planning, deployment, battle, and recovery. During planning season, you collect tax revenues, recruit troops, and identify battle targets. During deployment season, you muster Warbands, travel the environment, and scout the terrain. During battle season, you engage opponents in battle and resolve individual skirmishes. During recovery season, you pay maintenance, retreat units and reinforce adjacent territories.&#10;&#10;Actions in each phase affect the outcome of the next phase. For example, by travelling the Environment and scouting the Terrain during deployment season; you will alter the engagements in battle season. The battle system requires each player to select up to 3 Warband Unit cards, from their hand, that face-off with competing kingdoms. After a simultaneous reveal, cards are resolved one-versus-one with additional Supply, Tactics, or Training cards from the Warband, and purchased during planning season, that are used to modify the encounter. Winning cards remain at the settlement. Losing cards are returned to the Kingdom Reserve and must be re-purchased to re-enter the game. The game ends after 5 (shorter), or 10 (longer), years of in-game play and the remaining player with the highest net-worth wins.&#10;&#10;This game is targeted at the serious strategy gamer and it is an in-depth title that combines deck-building, a working economy and geographic constraints.&#10;&#10;",

They then look in their hand for any pairs that make words (such as &quot;cow&quot; and &quot;boy&quot;) and lay them down.  There are also &quot;Higamus&quot; and &quot;Hogamus&quot; cards depicting the titular pigs that are worth bonus points but must be announced when drawn (so other players can draw from their hands to try to steal the points) and Krazy Kat and Holy Cow cards that deduct points.&#10;&#10;A round ends when either any player runs out of cards or a player holds both Higamus and Hogamus in his or her hand.  Players score one point for each card they have laid down, five points each for Higamus or Hogamus and negative five points each for Holy Cow and Krazy Kat.&#10;&#10;An alternate version of the game allows players to ask other players for specific cards and play either cards that form compound words or matching cards.  In this version, Krazy Kat and Holy Cow are a match as are Higamus and Hogamus.&#10;&#10;",

The theme is building a portfolio of loans.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt seven cards, and the rest of the cards go into a draw pile.  On their turns, players check their hands for completed loans (a loan card and matching collateral card, or these two plus a guaranty card for higher-value loans) and then lay the cards down face-down in their portfolio.  They then either draw a card from the draw pile or take the top card from the face-up discard pile.  If they have more than seven cards, they must now discard down to seven.&#10;&#10;Other cards can help complete loans, take away money, steal card from other players, steal or protect completed loans or cause another player's loan to be auctioned.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the draw pile is gone.  Players add the value of all their completed loans and subtract regulatory or legal fee cards and any unplayed completed loans they hold.  The player with the highest total wins.&#10;&#10;",

The taxi fee is determined by counting the spaces between the destination and the current location of the taxi car. Now, all the players must reach their destinations on the map by throwing two 6-sided dice and moving according to them on the board. When a customer reaches his destination, the player must pick up a red destination card: Will the customer be able to pay after all? Or will he even tip you some extra? Or maybe rob you of half of your money?&#10;&#10;After successfully completing a trip, the players return to a taxi station to pick up a new customer.

I mean, how else is rescue going to find you?&#10;&#10;While wondering the island you learn a few things, food is scarce, resources and equipment are hard to come by and nothing is what it seems.&#10;&#10;As night falls and a breathtaking sunset fills the sky, a weird mist seems to roll in off the coast. From the mist you see these things emerge. Human like figures stagger, crawl and sprint towards you. You don't know what you are about to face, do you fight or flee?&#10;&#10;Game Play&#10;&#10;Players take turns moving their pawns around the island and using action points. They use these points to collect food and resources. Using a crafting system you can make weapons and tools to help you survive.&#10;&#10;The game is played over the course of a Day and Night rounds. In the day rounds, You can wonder freely, but when night comes around, your actions are limited as well as your movement. With the setting sun, you will also start spawning numerous Cannibals around the island on specifically designated spawning locations.&#10;&#10;You can either fight Cannibals by rolling die, or run around them. By day break, cannibals will disappear into the forests until next night fall. As you finish your SOS sign, the island and cannibals will become more aggressive. Get off the island quick, but don't leave yourself vulnerable.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to get off the island alive and with as many people as possible. It is possible to be left behind, but the game is easier if you work together.&#10;&#10;",

Show them your skills by collecting the golden monster teeth. But be aware - the lands of Taora are not as peaceful as they seem. Rumor has it, that in the dark and gloomy Netherworld, some friends become enemies...&#10;&#10;Now get up and hurry! The Heldentaufe already started. Be the first who returns the teeth of glory.&#10;&#10;The unique experience of Heldentaufe arises due to two distinct but connected realms: The Upper world and the Netherworld. Heroes can travel back and forth to the separate worlds through so-called &quot;portals&quot;.&#10;&#10;Events and activities taking place in the Upper world are mostly serene and peaceful. You will harvest natural goods, carry out missions and trade items that you find. Somewhere hidden in the Netherworld lies a bright and shiny treasure. But what underworld would be complete without monsters and traps?&#10;&#10;Players will change perspective frequently since they not only have to tell their hero which move to make next, but also command the monsters in the Netherworld, as soon as an opponent enters the dark realm. In a game with three or four players, forging an alliance to increase a player's odds in combat against monsters can be a smart choice. However, players should choose their swordmates wisely - once unearthed, the treasures of the Netherworld might lead even their most trusted allies to suddenly turn against them...&#10;&#10;Due to the two distinctly different worlds, both aggressive warmongers and pacifistic characters will embrace the gameplay of Heldentaufe.&#10;&#10;Heldentaufe is easy to learn and lets you experience all the key elements of a true adventure role-playing game (discovering treasures, collecting items, completing missions, and battling monsters).&#10;&#10;A game for tactical players who can count on their luck in critical situations.&#10;&#10;",

Dominate other Wizards in the field of Wizard Battle through your magical and mental might! Battle takes place over a series of turns in which Wizards privately perform their actions, all the while engaging in secret diplomacy with one another; cunning and ruthlessness will get you everywhere. All consequences are described simultaneously by the Overseer, as every Wizard can watch their fate - good or bad - unfold. But it's not set in stone, as time manipulating magics allow diabolical flexibility. Ultimately, at the end of the Wizard Battle, the Wizard not yet blown to pieces or driven insane wins access to the Wish spell and the title of #1 Wizard!&#10;&#10;Features:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Outwit your opponents for the title of #1 Wizard and access to the Wish spell.&#10;    Game-play completable in 30 to 60 minutes.&#10;    Easily playable anywhere, including online, because there are no physical pieces.&#10;    15 different spells to cast, plus the option to stab your opponents, or take a nap.&#10;    Time travel to previous turns to change your actions.&#10;    Diplomatic gameplay where you make or break alliances as you need.&#10;    Optional rules to mix things up further, including a multi-game Wizard Tournament.&#10;    Playable against Satan for the rights to your immortal soul.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

I would hope to wish you to enjoy your trip, however we have had word from the secret service that we have a King and an Assassin on board.  The King is travelling incognito for his security. we do not know who the King is. The Assassin is also unknown to us.  You must find and identify the assassin before our voyage is over.&#10;&#10;Each guest at your party takes on a role, maybe Diamond Thief,  Body Snatcher, Police Inspector, Hypnotist and more. Each card has certain powers and lets you look at another players card. In that way, each guest can work the room until they can identify the Assassin and the King.  BUT! Players can swap cards &ndash; so who you thought was the Assassin might be someone else by the time the game ends!&#10;&#10;There can be several winners. If you have met your personal objective &ndash; as set on the card you hold at the end of the game &ndash; you are a winner. Also, if you can identify the Assassin &ndash; you are a winner&#10;&#10;This game is a variation on the idea and mechanics first seen in 2 Rooms and a Boom, but re-engineered for longer and more free-from party play.&#10;&#10;The pack of 60 cards is available for download and print and play.&#10;&#10;In addition, you will need to link to one of the sound files which acts as a timer through the game.&#10;&#10;Select the sound file you want depending on how long you want the game to last.&#10;&#10;You can play the sound file direct from the website, or you can download it for playing on PC, tablet or MP3 player.&#10;&#10;",

Find and return the most items to win!&#10;&#10;Paw Patrol Beach Rescue is a very simple pick up and deliver game for young children. The object of the game is to earn the most treats. On your turn, guide your pup from Lookout Tower all the way to the beach by driving along the roads. Once there, pick up a mystery token. Find out where it belongs by matching the image on the token to the image on the mat. Place the token in your pup's vehicle and drive it to the correct location on the mat.  Place the token in its spot on the mat and collect a treat if one is available.  Lastly, drive the treat back to Lookout Tower and place it in your parking spot.&#10;&#10;There are more mystery tokens than there are treats, so you may not collect a treat after every delivery.  Also, some tokens are worth three treats right away and do not need to be delivered. Once the beach is clear of mystery tokens the game ends and the player with the most treats wins.&#10;&#10;",

But there was so much to prepare in Equestria! So, she did what any good leader would do: she delegated! And now you and your friends can play as Ponies as you help prepare Equestria for the party in My Little Pony Game of Life.&#10;&#10;My Little Pony Game of Life sets players on a course preparing Equestria, but also learning the importance of friendship. You'll gain friends and earn Friendship Points, which will help you overcome obstacles, find supplies for the celebration, and get back to Ponyville in enough time to party down. Plus, you get four collectible Pony pieces, different from (but in the same scale as) the pieces in My Little Pony Monopoly (so all the Ponies can play together). My Little Pony Game of Life proves that the most important things in life are the friends you make along your journey through it. Awwww.&#10;&#10;",

And they&rsquo;re not there for the fishing. In front of them, the French divisions are just starting to reach their position after a forced marche. And they don&rsquo;t know exactly what to expect.&#10;Rather than a large offensive and pitched battle, the battles that followed were a succession of chaotic attacks and counter-attacks, dashes forward, retreats and reorganizations.  The German breakthrough, as spectacular as it may have been, was the result of stubborn, bitter and costly fighting.&#10;&#10;Freely inspired by the excellent Rommel at the Meuse, a game by Randy Moorehead published as a DTP by Simulations Workshop in 1995 - These are two very different games and systems, but the issues and the salient points of the battle had already been well thought out and built into RatM.&#10;&#10;Published in Battles Magazine #10, 2015&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: approx 4 hours&#10;Hex: 1 miles / 1.6 kilometers&#10;Units: Company to Regiment&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 18 x 33&quot; full color map&#10;Two dual-side printed countersheets (280 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 16-page Sedan rulebook&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 2-15&#10;&#10;",

Game goes on until one player has marked all categories. The player with most marks wins.&#10;&#10;So what we do with the pictured cards? If question master rolls a six and player answers right, then he/she may request additional picture card question. Question master then asks all six questions on that card. Player gets extra points (number of right answer -2). He/she adds/subtracts the amount from category he/she already has marks.

        "description": "This game helps kids learn math by engaging multiple learning styles (Social, Visual, Verbal/Auditory, and Logical/Mathematical)  The game is won by collecting goal cards.  Goal cards are won by using mathematical operators to join cards in a grid into other cards which are set aside as goal cards.  The grid cards are revealed and re-hidden during the game, so there is a memory aspect as well.&#10;&#10;The game can be played at multiple levels from early elementary (just learning addition and subtraction with two digit numbers) to teens who know multiplication and division well and are learning powers, roots, and the Fibonacci series.  Using a timer (not provided), you can handicap the game so that adults can play against young children.&#10;&#10;The game teaches both regular numbers (1, 2, 3...) as well as Roman numbers.  All cards also use images of dice to help kids understand the connection between the abstract number and the quantity that it represents.  This can help anyone struggling with math, but it is especially helpful for certain special needs students.&#10;&#10;The game was designed by a group of kids aged 10-15 as part of their First Lego League research project.  The game works well as a team game, if you have more than 6 players.&#10;&#10;",

Join middle-schooler Nate and his friends as they run from classroom to classroom collecting detention cards.  Along the way Coach John might surprise you!  The player with the fewest detention and fail cards wins.&#10;&#10;Further information: Players must roll and move through the spaces representing hallways and classrooms.  Each player must collect a report card from each of six classrooms.  Along the way, they may get Detention cards in various ways, such as being caught in the hall when the bell rings or being caught by good student Artur. Each player must also draw and play an action card each turn.  Some cards allow extra moves, moving other players or discarding or taking extra detention cards.  Others are &quot;Coach John All Play&quot; cards which require all players to complete a physical challenge (such a making and flying a paper airplane). First player to get all six report cards discards two detention cards and then total detention and &quot;fail&quot; report cards are counted, &quot;pass&quot; report cards are subtracted and the player with the lowest total wins.&#10;&#10;",

The chips can be anything...candies, toys, coins, stones, etc. Who loves the ocean most between you three? He becomes the first dealer. Shuffle all cards well, and deal one card to each player. Do not show your card to anyone. Put the remaining card face down at the center of the table.&#10;&#10;The first turn goes to the player to the right of the dealer and continues counter-clockwise. The active player decides to either PARLAY (trade cards with the player to their right) or KEEP (keep their currently held card). The next player does the same. If the third player chooses PARLAY, they change cards with the remaining card in the center of the table.&#10;&#10;After each player has had one chance to PARLAY or KEEP, a countdown...3, 2, 1...is shouted and everyone reveals their card at the same time. The highest numbered card wins UNLESS both the 3 Card and the 0 Card have been revealed. In this case, reverse the order and the lowest numbered card wins! The player with the weakest card pays a chip to the center of the table.&#10;&#10;Play more rounds until one player is out of chips. After that, the dealer deals 1 card to each player and 2 cards in a stack, face down to the center of the table. If a player chooses to PARLAY, they replace their card with the top card in the stack at the center of the table. Continue playing rounds until only one player remains and is declared the winner!&#10;&#10;",

All cards are Japanese language only, unlike the dual language (ENG and JPN) Shephy.&#10;&#10;The rules are basically the same as Shephy, but scaled down slightly. The player starts with one sheep in their field, and must manage the event cards presented to you in order to accumulate ONE HUNDRED sheep in the field before you go through the deck of event cards three times.&#10;&#10;The sheep deck consists of values 1, 3, 10, 30, and 100; at the start of the game, you place a 1 sheep card in your field, then shuffle the event cards and lay out three cards to form your hand. On a turn, you choose one card, carry out its effect, then refill your hand to three cards. Event cards might duplicate existing sheep cards, add new ones, swap one value of sheep for another, remove sheep, etc. Play through the deck until you have no cards in hand, then shuffle the event cards.&#10;&#10;If you go through the deck three times without having at least one 100 sheep card in the field or if at any point in the game you have no sheep in the field, then you lose.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "It is a time of unrest in 1920s Europa. The ashes from the first great war still darken the snow. The capitalistic city-state known simply as &ldquo;The Factory&rdquo;, which fueled the war with heavily armored mechs, has closed its doors, drawing the attention of several nearby countries.&#10;&#10;Scythe is an engine-building game set in an alternate-history 1920s period. It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player represents a character from one of five factions of Eastern Europe who are attempting to earn their fortune and claim their faction's stake in the land around the mysterious Factory. Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.&#10;&#10;Each player begins the game with different resources (power, coins, combat acumen, and popularity), a different starting location, and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction&rsquo;s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game (each faction always starts in the same place).&#10;&#10;Scythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player&rsquo;s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are &ldquo;encounter&rdquo; cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.&#10;&#10;Scythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.&#10;&#10;Every part of Scythe has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times.&#10;&#10;",

On each turn, the active player may choose to either 1) roll the dice, or 2) pass. If the player rolls the dice, they choose 1 result and place a chip on that die spot. If there is already a chip there, they cannot choose that rolled die number.&#10;&#10;A) If the chosen rolled die shows 2-6, that is the player's movement value. Move the pawn forward; each step costs as much as the number in the space being moved to. Repeat until you cannot move further. B) If the chosen die shows 1, the player's next movement value will be doubled.&#10;&#10;After finishing A or B, return to choosing 1 or 2 again.&#10;&#10;The winner is the first player to reach Japan!&#10;&#10;&#10;    2 six-sided dice and player pawns are needed but not included with this postcard game. &#10;&#10;&#10;",

Coal was discovered here, close to the Earth's surface. During the game, players obtain knowledge about this new material, extend their farms, and dig deeper in the ground to extract more coal. The game has many paths that lead to victory.&#10;&#10;Haspelknecht has an innovative action selection mechanism. You must select the correct tasks while being mindful of quickly accumulating pit water, for it can stall your efforts and prevent your extraction of valuable coal.&#10;&#10;&#226;&#128;&#168;The game offers a lot of variation and replayability through unique methods in setting-up the development tiles.&#10;&#10;",

Its location on the Baltic and North Seas and on the trade routes between Scandinavia and the Frankish Empire led to goods from around the known world &mdash; such as the Baltics, Baghdad, and Constantinople &mdash; being traded here.&#10;&#10;The subject of constant wars and changes of power, as well as the progressive Christianization of those in the north, Haithabu &mdash; known as &quot;Hedeby&quot; in English &mdash; had a rich history that ended in 1050 when the Norwegian king sacked and burned the town in a conflict with Denmark.&#10;&#10;As Vikings, players trade with all the known world while also living through the changes and dark days at the end of the Early Middle Ages. In the game, players take turns performing individual actions on an action rondel, and what's most critical in the game is the timing of the actions because in each round each color of action can be selected only once. Players must react to market price changes and event dice that can cause complications.&#10;&#10;",

Your goal is to move up the beach avoiding obstacles and mines, to eventually get to the Pillbox and destroy it!&#10;&#10;The game consists of phases and turns. You have a demolition engineer and a sniper to help you reach the pillbox.&#10;&#10;You must use your Demo Engineer to destroy barriers in your way but don't use all your 6 demo charges or you won't be able to destroy the pillbox and you will lose!&#10;&#10;The sniper can help remove German machine gun nests that will attack you while in the open. Your sniper only has 6 shots so make them count, after that you will be shot every time you move in the open or side to side without sight restrictions.&#10;&#10;You will lay out a 3x3 grid of Beach Terrain card to create the beach assault and as you progress up the beach you will create a new beach assault 3 more times until you get to the pillbox.&#10;&#10;Here is the link to the WIP thread!&#10;http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1275178/wip-attack-omaha-beach-18-card-microgame-contest-e&#10;&#10;Here is the link to the 18 Card Microgame contest thread!&#10;http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/178832/item/3575479#item3575479&#10;&#10;",

You will present each puppy with a set of cards which represent a home you&rsquo;ve found. Each home offers different amounts of Food, Love, or Room in varying combinations.&#10;&#10;Goal: The player who offers the best home gets to keep a record of that adoption in their portfolio. Score points by collecting cards with matching ranks, suits, and breeds. The player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;How to Play: On your turn, you may draw two cards and allow your opponents to draw one. OR you may offer a set of cards to a puppy that is available from the center of the table or in front of another player. Your offer must meet certain minimum requirements noted by the puppy's tag. If taking a puppy from an opponent, you must offer a *better* set of cards, again based on the puppy's tag. If you begin your turn with a puppy in front of you, then add that card to your portfolio where it will be scored at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;",

An alien infection is spreading through the ship and some players may already be infected when the game starts. It is not clear, however, who is infected and who isn't. Each turn, each player visits another player in his/her quarters, to protect the fellow crew member from infection (or, alternatively, to infect him).&#10;&#10;On board are engineers (who can perform a body scan), a doctor (who can surgically remove an alien and perform a blood transfusion) and the doctor's assistant. Each turn, the players vote on who is going to perform which action and on whom, to clear the infection. However, among the voting crew memebers are those that are already infected and who want to infect the entire crew. Other players each have a special ability they can use to spread or to stop the infection. The end of the game (which has as much turns as players) is either a victory for the aliens or the humans.&#10;&#10;",

The theme and mechanics are based upon the re-discovered Selden Map which depicts trading routes in China and had been lost for nearly 300 years. In Fujian Trader, players assume the role of Ming-era merchant families following trading routes in the East China Sea. Victory-points are gained by trading (or raiding) the goods of iron, silk, and rice for silver and influence. To win, players must accrue the most victory-points in order to successfully endure the Manchu invasion and subsequent Ming Empire collapse at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The game board is divided up into six different regions separated into six different colors. Each region has several ports. Players start out with a number of ports (dependent on the number of players) and may receive goods based off of which ports they control. When ports produce goods depends on the roll of a colored die. The color the die lands on coincides with the six colored regions and determines which produces goods for that round. Players may purchase additional ports with money gained from trading or incite rebellions in already controlled ports to wrestle them from an opponent.&#10;&#10;The game ends after the Manchu first invade the Ming Empire. The invasion starts once the last of three Manchu Move cards is drawn from the Event deck. Players then have a three rounds to trade goods and two rounds to store silver, thus accruing victory-points. After the third round of the invasion the game ends, and players tally up victory points to determine who wins.&#10;&#10;",

Take the role of one of California's three main regions (NorCal, SoCal, and the Central Valley) and try to find a solution to the fundamental cause of California's drought: there's more water demand than there's water.&#10;&#10;Based on extensive research on California water history and current conditions, California Water Crisis will expose you to real world challenges such as special interest groups, groundwater depletion, and population growth.&#10;&#10;Providing realism and replay value, the 3 regions have different starting resources, weaknesses, and potential strategies.  This game takes about 10 minutes to learn and about 40-60 minutes to play.  In addition to the main game, there are also two scenarios: one set in the late 1800s in the bad old days of reckless resource exploitation, and a cooperative scenario set in the mid 21st century.&#10;&#10;",

Each player takes the role of a magician that can interfere with the test event in the tower. He is doing this by playing movement cards with which he can move both, each apprentice, as well as the Master. Each magician would also like that the apprentices also fulfill a secret spell for them and, of course, every magician also has two favorite students, whom he'd like to complete their examination successfully.&#10;&#10;The game ends either a magician succeeded in making his two students pass their test or the time has expired.

Each letter has an assigned number of points, and each word places scores points. Additionally, if one closes the right surrounding a numbered field, one collects as many points as the number signifies. The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

Each card represents a type of building that the players may add to their cities.&#10;&#10;The active player rolls three dice, chooses one number to keep, then passes the remaining dice clockwise for other players to select. The active player may then negotiate with opponents to trade dice, in order to build up certain combinations of numbers, which represent different kinds of resources. These combinations are then spent to purchase cards to be added to the player's tableau.&#10;&#10;The game ends either when one player reaches a total of 20 points or when the last &quot;Mercantile House&quot; card in the supply is purchased. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

However, in response to requests from play-testers, they have been extended to cover everything between the biblical era and the late medieval period.&#10;&#10;They have been designed so that they can be used for anything from solo play with 100 or so miniatures through to huge games with 3000 plus miniatures and up to 5 players a side. A square grid has been used to promote speed of play. This also enables figures which have been based on different frontages for use with a variety of rule systems to be used together on the same battlefield.&#10;&#10;Absolutely no dice are used in To the Strongest! Instead, an innovative (and entertaining) mechanism uses playing cards to activate units, which can each potentially move or fight multiple times during the same turn. Shooting and melees are resolved quickly and decisively, amidst a flurry of playing cards....&#10;&#10;Despite their relative simplicity, the author believes that these rules capture the essential flavour of an ancient or medieval battle, and that the more seasoned gamer will find more than enough command decisions to entertain and challenge him. He wishes that players may enjoy very many happy games, and may victory always fall to the strongest!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "User summary&#10;In this cooperative game, players begin by selecting hero cards from among four different colors (representing the elements earth, wind, fire, and water) to form a party. Each player then receives a hand of cards drawn from a central deck, which also represents the players' hit points. The players face a series of monster cards drawn from an enemy deck.&#10;&#10;The heroes begin at level one, but they earn tokens during the game that may be spent to level up their attack abilities. Each hero may only attack when the player has played a card matching its color. The card that is played must match either the color or the number of the card that was previously played, though multiple cards may be played under special circumstances.&#10;&#10;Monster attacks force players to discard from the central deck, decreasing the available hit points. Leveling up the heroes helps players to reclaim these discarded hit points, essentially &quot;healing&quot; the group.&#10;&#10;After facing a series of monsters, the players confront a powerful boss monster in a final battle. The players all win or lose together.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;The players choose unit cards of various spirits to form parties. Each unit card has unique effects and can be played in various combinations.&#10;&#10;Holding circuit cards with numbers 0 to 4 and 4 colors as your hands, play the cards with numbers and colors matching those of the cards in the play area. If you have a unit card matching the played card in your party, that unit will attack the enemy.&#10;&#10;Thus, play cards to attack and destroy the enemies that appear one after another. You can also gain magical power by card plays and use that power to&#10;activate your unit's special ability as well as raise the unit's level to lead the battle advantageously. The enemies' final boss is very powerful. The players need to cooperate and support each other for victory. In this 3rd edition, the statuses of unit cards and enemy cards have been adjusted and the easy mode has been introduced.&#10;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#230;&#167;&#152;&#227;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#231;&#178;&#190;&#233;&#156;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#189;&#149;&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#233;&#129;&#184;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#181;&#144;&#230;&#136;&#144;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#229;&#155;&#186;&#230;&#156;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#138;&#185;&#230;&#158;&#156;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#140;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#167;&#152;&#227;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#231;&#181;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;0&#239;&#189;&#158;4&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#239;&#188;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#137;&#178;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#143;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#229;&#155;&#158;&#232;&#183;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#140;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#232;&#137;&#178;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#144;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#152;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#144;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#152;&#232;&#137;&#178;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#149;&#181;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#148;&#187;&#230;&#146;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#172;&#161;&#227;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#231;&#143;&#190;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#230;&#149;&#181;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#148;&#187;&#230;&#146;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#230;&#146;&#131;&#231;&#160;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;

Players will build and explore the small world of Myrtille and complete missions what can have some environmental impact.&#10;&#10;The game is made of location card (river, house, beach, forest, garbage dump, shop&hellip;), colored pawns, objective cards (which indicates what pawns should go where), two dice (one with colors and one with numbers), and time cards.&#10;&#10;Each player has one objective card and a few location cards. The four edges of each location cards have one of three colors.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, one location card is put on the table and will represent the board used by all the players. All colored pawns are placed on this card.&#10;&#10;On its turn, a player rolls the two die, and uses only one of them.&#10;&#10;If they choose the colored dice, then they add a location card to the board, that will thus get bigger and bigger. To do so, they have to place one of their location card next to a card already on the board such that both adjacent edges have the same color as the die. Also, if the new card is adjacent to more than one card, all adjacent edges must have the same color.&#10;&#10;If they choose the numbered dice, then they can move one pawn using as many movement points as shown on the dice, each adjacent card using one movement point. They can only move a pawn whose color matches one of the pawn depicted on their objective card.&#10;&#10;An objective card is complete when all pawns depicted on the objective card are on one location card matching the location of the objective card. The group as a whole earns the victory points printed on the objective card.&#10;&#10;The game has a limited number of turn, which is tracked using the time cards.&#10;&#10;",

Players will claim they have support of various citizens to gain coins, look at other player's cards or they may trade coins or cards, it will be up to all players to decide who may be bluffing.

Above the desert is a green verdant moon called Paradise.  The Wanderer is learning Kung-Fu in hopes to somehow defy the impossible and reach this moon.&#10;&#10;In the desert player&rsquo;s will find familiarities to the world of Spell Saga.

It contains magical items, mysterious places, and dangerous battles. Your hero will have to grow in order to reach the goal of the game, but don&rsquo;t worry, the hero will grow as the world around them is explored.&#10;&#10;This game is also a story. The major plot of And Away is always the same, but what you do during the game and if you survive is up to you.&#10;&#10;It can be played an endless amount of times, without ever experiencing the same game twice.&#10;&#10;And Away consists of one 41 card deck, which represents the first act of the story. Players will start with all the cards FaceDown in a pile, and two marked &ldquo;starting cards&rdquo; flipped FaceUp in a second pile.&#10;&#10;Progression through the game occurs by Flipping FaceDown cards and either Acknowledging (bringing them to the FaceUp pile) or Ignoring (Cycling them back under the FaceDown pile) based on the game state until each card in the Deck is FaceUp.&#10;&#10;",

If both players place all of their pieces without getting three in a row, the second player wins.&#10;&#10;For rule set #2 (2-4 players), players take turns drawing random pieces from a bag and placing them on the board. If a player manages to surround any number of pieces in a line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) with two cookies of the same color (one on either end), the player captures all of the surrounded pieces. The captured pieces are worth points at the end of the game. Bonus points are obtained by capturing sets of certain color combinations.

The cards activate units to move, fire, assault, and use special powers, such as explosive rounds, telekinesis, and more. Special cards, such as critical hit or bullet storm, can also enhance a unit's attacks.&#10;&#10;Each turn continues until three end turn cards have been drawn. Players then choose one card from their hand to keep, the administrative markers are removed from the board, and a new hand is dealt to each player. The players use that new hand, or the card kept from the previous turn, to bid for initiative in the new turn.&#10;&#10;Night of Man ships with numerous scenarios, as well as a point system that allows gamers to put together their own battles in no time flat.&#10;&#10;",

In the original game players draw one card from their deck and throw one card &ndash; but if they have the right icons in play, they'll draw more cards, throw more cards, steal cards from opponents and dump them in the gutter, break free of the shared playing space in order to keep from being covered, and &ndash; perhaps most important of all &ndash; score points each turn when they have enough visible icons in play.&#10;&#10;In this standalone expansion, players have the choice of 6 new factions that use a combination of the 6 existing and 6 all new abilities. Each of the factions plays very different from another. Some focus on skill (Wendy from Doomtown), and others focus on protection, reviving cards, and even bombs.&#10;&#10;There are also brand new land cards that offer special abilities.&#10;&#10;Integrates with:&#10;&#10;    Maximum Throwdown&#10;&#10;&#10;",

On each space where they land, they must answer a question from one of six decks, all of which focus on some aspect of global diversity. A correct answer earns the player a colored chip.

        "description": "Extraordinary is a superhero-themed strategy card game by designer Roger Alan Cotton for 2 players, ages 12 and up.&#10;&#10;PREMISE&#10;&#10;Players each control a team of seven super-powered characters who battle through an episode from an original comic book issue story line.&#10;&#10;Each Episode is comprised of seven Hero Objectives and seven competing Villain Objectives.&#10;&#10;In order to complete an objective, a hero or villain must use a requisite super power (listed on the Objective Card) to perform a specific Feat (listed next to the super power on the Objective Card).&#10;&#10;To complete the Feat, a character must roll a result that equals or exceeds the Objective's target Completion Point Value (CPV).&#10;&#10;Should the character successfully perform the Objective Feat, an opponent's character may still attempt to thwart it. This is accomplished in the manner explained above.&#10;&#10;If the Thwart Feat roll result equals or exceeds its target CPV, it is successful, and the opponent's Objective Feat fails. In addition, the thwarting team gains a two-point advantage on its next turn, when attempting to complete its own objective.&#10;&#10;Either team may attempt to complete their unfinished objectives on their subsequent turns.&#10;&#10;However, as soon as either side completes an objective that isn't thwarted, that part of the Episode story line is &quot;locked down,&quot; and the Objective Card is &quot;won&quot; by the team that completed it.&#10;&#10;______________________________________________________________________________________&#10;&#10;OBJECTIVE&#10;&#10;Win four or more of the Episode's seven objectives.&#10;&#10;______________________________________________________________________________________&#10;&#10;&#10;GAME SET UP&#10;&#10;1. Decide who will play the Heroes League and who will play the Villains League. Place the appropriate Player Mat on the playing area in front of you.&#10;&#10;2. Decide which Comic Book Issue you will be playing. Bring out this issue&rsquo;s corresponding Issue Cover Card and place it off to the side of the play area, between the players for reference. Next to this card, place that Issue&rsquo;s Episode Card, and the corresponding Episode Objective Cards (stacked face-down and in sequence).&#10;&#10;3. Each Player selects (7) super heroes or super villains and places them face-down on the playing area before them. These characters should have power icons and keywords on them that match as many power icons and keywords listed on the Episode Objective Cards.&#10;&#10;Shuffle each of these characters&rsquo; (5) Action Cards in with the (25) core cards in your League Deck.&#10;&#10;4. Take all of the Resource Cards and separate them into four face-down card stacks: NPCs, Powers, Tech, and Upgrades. Shuffle each card stack and flip face-up the top card of each stack.&#10;&#10;5. Determine First Player&#10;&#10;Each player rolls (1) die. The player who rolls the highest result is the Active Player during Turn 1. Reroll any tied roll results.&#10;&#10;From Turn 2 onward, players alternate being the Active Player.&#10;&#10;6. Both players flip their characters face-up.&#10;&#10;7. Draw (7) cards each to form your starting Hands.&#10;&#10;______________________________________________________________________________________&#10;&#10;GAME TURN PHASES&#10;&#10;Each game turn in XO! is divided into five phases:&#10;&#10;1. Status Check Phase&#10;2. Card Discard/Draw Phase&#10;3. Attack Phase&#10;4. Feat/Thwart Phase&#10;5. Turn Resolution Phase&#10;&#10;______&#10;&#10;1. STATUS CHECK Phase&#10;&#10;(This phase is skipped during the first turn)&#10;&#10;Remove Status cards tagged to any Characters or Objects in play who were &lt;Blinded&gt;, &lt;Short-Circuited&gt;, &lt;Staggered&gt;, &lt;Stunned&gt;, or &lt;Winded&gt;.&#10;&#10;Characters or Objects in play who are tagged with the &lt;Damaged&gt;, &lt;Injured&gt;, &lt;Incapacitated&gt;, &lt;Prone&gt;, &lt;Sabotaged&gt;, or &lt;Trapped&gt; Status Cards retain their Status cards until other cards are played that instruct players to remove them.&#10;&#10;2. CARD DISCARD / DRAW Phase&#10;&#10;On the First Turn, both players draw (7) cards to form their Hands.&#10;&#10;At the start of every turn thereafter, players may each discard up to (2) cards from their Hands, and then draw back up to (7) cards.&#10;&#10;3. ATTACK Phase&#10;&#10;During this phase, the Active Player may attack with as many characters as he wishes (as long as those characters are able to do so, and have the requisite Energy Cards to use cards from the Active Player&rsquo;s Hand).&#10;&#10;NOTE: Card play may change the order of some attacks, regardless of who the Active Player is at the time.&#10;&#10;- Combat Rounds&#10;&#10;Each Combat Round is divided into three segments: Hit Determination segment, Damage Effect Determination segment, and Counterattack segment.&#10;&#10;Each attack is resolved in whatever order the Active Player desires. The Responding Player may play applicable defenses and modifier cards to counter the attacks.&#10;&#10;The Active Player indicates which character in play is attacking, and who the defending enemy character or target will be.&#10;&#10;Hit Determination Segment&#10;&#10;During this phase segment, you determine if an attack hits or misses.&#10;&#10;The Attacking Character (Attacker) rolls the number of dice indicated by the value on his or her card&rsquo;s Attack Icon. The Defending Character (Defender) rolls the number of dice indicated by the value on his or her card&rsquo;s Defense Icon.&#10;The Attacker&rsquo;s attack roll result (plus any applicable modifiers) becomes his/her Attack Combat Value (ACV). The Defender&rsquo;s attack roll result (plus any applicable modifiers) becomes his/her Defense Combat Value (DCV).&#10;Compare the DCV to the ACV:&#10;If the DCV equals or exceeds the ACV, the attack fails, and the Defender takes no damage, and suffers no attack effects. The Attack Phase immediately ends.&#10;&#10;If the ACV exceeds the DCV, the attack hits, and the Defender takes damage. Proceed to the Damage Effect Determination segment.&#10;&#10;Damage Effect Determination Segment&#10;&#10;During this phase segment, you determine how much damage the Defender sustains, and what effect, if any, the attack has on the Defender&rsquo;s Readiness Status.&#10;&#10;The difference between the Attacker&rsquo;s ACV and the Defender&rsquo;s DCV is the amount of damage the Defender sustains. This Damage Value (plus any Attack Effect Damage) is compared to the Defender&rsquo;s Health Value which is listed within his/her card&rsquo;s Health Icon:&#10;&#10;If the amount of damage sustained is less than the Defender&rsquo;s Health Value, the character remains in play. If the attack has a listed effect, that attack effect is now applied (see Attack Effects).&#10;If the amount of damage sustained is equal to the Defender&rsquo;s Health Value, the character remains in play but is tagged with the &lt;Stunned&gt; Status card.&#10;If the amount of damage sustained by the Defender is greater than his/her Health Value, the Defender is &lt;KOd&gt; and placed on top of the League Deck discard pile.&#10;&#10;- Attack Effects&#10;&#10;Different attacks have different effects. For &lt;Blinded&gt;, &lt;Burned&gt;, &lt;Frozen&gt;, &lt;Horrified&gt;, &lt;Knocked Back&gt;, &lt;Staggered&gt;, or &lt;Stunned&gt; attack effects, tag the Defender&rsquo;s card with the appropriate Status card.&#10;&#10;Tagging a card means to attach a Status Card to it.&#10;&#10;Follow the instructions on attached Status Cards to determine their impact on characters and objects for the rest of the turn.&#10;&#10;- Moffed Attacks and Defenses&#10;&#10;If a Defender or Attacker rolls (1) or more dice, and all of the roll results equal (0), that defense or attack is considered to have &ldquo;monumentally failed&rdquo; (moffed).&#10;&#10;When the Defender&rsquo;s DCV is moffed, s/he sustains (+1) Die of Damage during the Damage Effect Determination segment.&#10;&#10;When the Attacker&rsquo;s ACV is moffed, the Defender has the opportunity to immediately counterattack.&#10;&#10;Counterattack Segment&#10;&#10;A Defender may only counterattack if s/he has the Counterattack ability, or if the Attacker moffed his/her ACV.&#10;&#10;To resolve the Counterattack, follow the standard combat resolution steps listed above. The Counterattack&rsquo;s Damage Type is determined by the Defender&rsquo;s Superpower Icon (listed on the Character card&rsquo;s upper-left corner).&#10;&#10;Once all of the Active Player&rsquo;s attacks have been resolved, his Attacks Phase ends.&#10;&#10;- AOE Damage Effects&#10;&#10;Some attacks indicate they are AOE Attacks. This means they are Area of Affect attacks which affect both the defending target of the attack and any characters adjacent to the Defender.&#10;&#10;5. FEATS COMPLETION Phase&#10;&#10;During this phase, the Active Player assigns a ready character in play with the requisite Power icon (or Keyword) to attempt a feat that will complete his league&rsquo;s current Episode Objective.&#10;&#10;- Resolving Feat Attempt&#10;&#10;The Active Player rolls as many dice as s/he can to attempt the feat (based on the numbers indicated on the acting character&rsquo;s card, as well as on any applicable cards from the Active Player&rsquo;s Hand):&#10;&#10;If the Feat Attempt roll result (plus any modifiers) equals or exceeds the Feat Completion Value (FCV) indicated within the Completion diamond, the feat is successfully completed.&#10;Otherwise, the feat attempt fails, and the phase ends.&#10;Should the Active Player&rsquo;s feat attempt succeed, the Responding Player may assign a ready character in play to attempt to thwart the feat.&#10;&#10;To do this, the Responding Player&rsquo;s character must have the requisite Power icon or Keyword to attempt the thwart:&#10;&#10;If the Thwart Attempt roll result (plus any modifiers) equals or exceeds the Thwart Completion Value (TCV) indicated within the Completion diamond, the feat is successfully completed.&#10;In this case, the Responding Player gains a 2-point bonus on his or her next turn, when attempting to complete his or her League&rsquo;s Episode Objective.&#10;If the thwart attempt fails, the Active Player &ldquo;wins&rdquo; the Episode Objective Card. The card is removed from the Story Line, and placed in the Active Player&rsquo;s Victory Area.&#10;SCORING&#10;&#10;Once all seven Episode Objective Cards have been completed, the player with four or more of them wins the game.&#10;&#10;6. TURN RESOLUTION Phase&#10;&#10;Once the Active Player has finished attacking and attempting a feat, his turn is over. If all seven Objective Cards are completed, the game ends, and you proceed to Scoring.&#10;&#10;Otherwise, the next player becomes the Active Player, and the game proceeds.&#10; ______________________________________________________________________________________&#10;&#10;COMBAT DICE&#10;&#10;Each player gets (7) six-sided dice to use during the game. The Heroes Player uses the White Mask dice and the Villains Player uses the Black Mask dice.&#10;&#10;Each combat die has six sides with different values listed on them. One side has the (0) value, two sides have the (1) value, two sides have the (2) value, and the last side has the (3) value.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "May 10th, 1864. A solid month of fighting found Grant no closer to the destruction of Lee's army than when his offensive started. Indeed, his losses exceeded Lee's by nearly two thirds. After escaping disaster in the Wilderness (when arguably only the wounding of Confederate General James Longstreet salvaged a stalemate from sure defeat), Grant now found himself grinding his army against the deadly abrasive of Rebel entrenchments.&#10;&#10;Desperate for a clean, quick solution, Grant listened attentively to the notions of a brash 24 year old Colonel named Emory Upton. Attack on a narrow front, Upton maintained, and do not pause to fire. The condensed mass, several lines deep, would simply ram its way across the parapets. The first line, after making initial penetration would then fan left and right, widening the breach. The succeeding lines would drive straight ahead, deepening the plunge. A reserve would then arrive, to stem the sure gray counterattack.&#10;&#10;Mule Shoe Salient is a regimental-level simulation of the Federal assault on May 12, 1864 at The Bloody Angle, which was the culmination of the Battle of Spotsylvania.&#10;&#10;Each unit represents several companies of 120 men/strength point, or artillery sections representing 2 guns. Players alternate moving units and firing. The Federal player wins if their units occupy three or more victory hexes, while the Confederate player wins if no victory hexes are occupied by Federal troops. Any other result is a draw.&#10;&#10;11x17 map, 140 die-cut counters, 12 page rulebook.&#10;&#10;(source: One Small Step website and user's description)&#10;&#10;",

It attempts to model the movement into four party politics and the rise of the SNP.&#10;&#10;The two players (Labour and Conservatives) place population markers derived from opinion polls (run by Press Cards) in 32 representative Constituencies. The Constituencies are grouped by type (rural, industrial, suburban) and by the three home nations (England, Scotland and Wales - Northern Ireland is dealt with separately). Other parties are placed according to rules that mimic their strengths and weaknesses by random draw from the Scrabble bag.&#10;&#10;In each phase of the game different placing rules apply as you move from placing your hardcore supporters (who tend to be in safe areas) up into the floating voters (who can be anywhere) on Election Night.&#10;&#10;At last we abandon further fiddling and offer (for a mere sum of &pound;5 via paypal; to charles.vasey@gmail.com) the next in the series from the 2010 Election. This time we are trying it in advance of the actual event.&#10;&#10;The game kit (for it is a mere primitive PNP) is a number of pdfs and spreadies giving you the map of UK represented as blocks of constituencies, the counters, and the press cards. It is pretty much an experience game.&#10;&#10;There will be an update after the actual Election.&#10;&#10;The pdfs should resize for Letter printing, but if not I'll save in Letter and then copy over.&#10;&#10;",

From your hand and the two decks, two players go head to head placing players on their basketball team and defining the offense and defense.  First draw from the player deck and play a card, then draw from the coaches deck and play a card each turn.  Player cards will only score for you if they are played in the right positions on the court.  This results in free-throws, jump-shots or 3 pointers. The coaches deck helps you pick which offense or defense both teams are using. Use the REF card to remove your opponents key player just before the quarter ends. With this simple 2 deck card game, you can re-create four quarters of a basketball game.&#10;&#10;",

Be the first player to get rid of your cards each round and have the lowest score at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The game is played in rounds. A round ends when one player has played all his cards. You then tally your points and the player to the left shuffles and deals a new hand.&#10;&#10;Each player begins with 9 cards, the the top card of the draw deck is flipped over, if its a wild card keep flipping. This determines the first card of the pattern.&#10;&#10;On your turn place a matching color, swipe or wild card on top of the first card.If you cannot play a card you must keep drawing till you do. Then place another card next to the first one, keep doing this until you run out of cards. You can start a pattern even if you can't finish it. If you finish it and have a card left over, add it to the pattern.&#10;&#10;When one person runs out of cards, its time to tally points. Any cards left in your hand are equal to 1 point. when 1 person gets to 15 points then the game is over. If no one gets 15 points that hand, then shuffle the cards and play another hand. If there is a tie all tied players win.&#10;&#10;",

To do so, players need to assemble a crew, collect provisions, and journey north to plunder gold, iron and livestock. Glory can be found in battle, even at the hands of the Valkyrie, so gather your warriors because it's raiding season!&#10;&#10;To impress the Chieftain, you need victory points (VPs), with those being acquired primarily by raiding settlements, taking plunder, and making offerings to the Chieftain. How you use your plunder is also vital to your success. Players take turns in clockwise order, and on a turn you place a worker and resolve its action, then pick up a different worker and resolve its action. Broadly speaking, those actions fall in one of two categories:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Work: Having a good crew and enough provisions are vital to successful raiding, so before making any raids, players need to do some work to prepare their crew and collect supplies. This is all done in the village at the bottom of the game board, with eight buildings offering various actions. You must first place your worker in an available building where no other worker is present, then pick up a different worker from a different building.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Raid: Once players have hired enough crew and collected provisions, you may choose to raid on your turn. To raid a settlement &mdash; whether a harbor, outpost, monastery or fortress &mdash; you need to meet three requirements: Having a large enough crew, having enough provisions (along with gold for monasteries and fortresses, and having a worker of the right color. Raiding offers various ways of scoring, such as military strength, plunder, and Valkyries, which is how grey and white workers enter the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends when only one fortress raid remains, all Valkyrie have been removed, or all offerings have been made, then players tally their scores.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "7 is a simple war game for two players based on the mechanics used in the boardgames 111: Alarm dla Warszawy and 303. The game takes us back in time to the Polish-Soviet war in 1920. One of the players is the commander of the 7th Fighter Escadrille &bdquo;Tadeusza Ko&#197;&#155;ciuszki&rdquo; (combined mostly by American pilots) defending Lwow during the Battle of Lvov in the middle of August 1920. Polish player has access to three Ansaldos A-1 &bdquo;Balilla&rdquo; fighters trying to push back waves of Soviet cavalry. He uses special dice to attack soviet units and bombs that he can refill in three airbases. Every time the cavalry is hit the unit spreads and loses turn. Soviet player is the commander of 1st Cavalry Army, he uses ten cavalry units to reach his goal of taking Lvov and spreading the communism throughout Poland and then as the next step whole Europe. The cavalry has limited options of attacking aircraft although by using on movement he can defend during the attack and fire one shot at attacking Polish fighters, with a little bit of luck he can even destroy it. Polish Air Forces mission is to defend Lvov  by delaying the attacks of cavalry till the end of  18th August when the Soviet Army decides to withdraw and continue their attack towards Warsaw. The game ends when the Soviets are out of time or they managed to capture Lvov. The name of the game &ldquo;7&rdquo; evokes one of the escadrilles, which pilots where mostly American soldiers volunteering to serve and protect Poland during the Soviet war. This makes &ldquo;7&rdquo; the prequel of 111 and 303, showing the beginning of Polish Air Forces.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The Marshals III covers the campaigns of winter 1814 that took place in France north of Lyon and in Italy on the Mincio. These theatres of operation are considered to be minor since they occurred far from the Emperor&rsquo;s view who was engaged in the north of France. Nevertheless, important and little-known battles took place there where the young Marie-Louise, the conscripts of the French army, displayed extraordinary courage. The first campaign, that of Marshal Augereau in France, recounts in three scenarios the march on the flanks of the Austrian army engaged against Napoleon.&#10;&#10;In the first, the &ldquo;Lion of Castiglione&rdquo; must seize Geneva to cover his march on the enemy lines of communication. The second relates the Austrians&rsquo; offensive return from Dijon and the fall of Lyon after the battle of Limonest. The third covers the whole campaign from the beginnings of Augereau&rsquo;s timid offensive to the loss of the &ldquo;capital of the Gauls&rdquo;. The second campaign, led by Eug&egrave;ne de Beauharnais, describes the fierce combats for the supremacy of northern Italy. Threatened at his rear by the betrayal of Murat who is moving up from the south of the &ldquo;boot&rdquo; with his Neapolitans, Eug&egrave;ne withdrew from Verona to Mantua. The first scenario, very brief, simulates the about-turn of the French on the Mincio to counter the Austrian advance. The second covers the whole campaign from the evacuation of Verona to the victories of Eug&egrave;ne against various enemy threats.&#10;&#10;With this new volume, The Marshals series evolves. The more imposing strengths of these campaigns required some adaptations that allowed for simulating the march of an entire army corps. These new rules are compatible with the previous modules with some minor adaptations.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In Dirty Little Secrets players are detectives with a slightly loose code of ethics. You&rsquo;ve used some tactics you&rsquo;re not proud of, but it&rsquo;s always gotten the job done. Now some of the other detectives are on a case that might reveal your dirty little secret. Can&rsquo;t let that happen, so better you expose their secret first. At least your partner has your back; seems it&rsquo;s hard to find someone you can rely on in this department.&#10;&#10;Players will work with their partner to use deduction and rough tactics to uncover your opponents&rsquo; cards, while using misdirection to cover your own tracks. Players must gather evidence, information about opponents&rsquo; cards, and choose the right times to make accusations. Be careful about it, though, as every action you take has a trade-off, and often this gives your opponents knowledge to use against you. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Aim of the Game&#10;&#10;You (and your partner) are trying to have the most Points at the end of the game. Points are gained by keeping your most valuable card secret until the end of the game, and using collected evidence to remove your opponents&rsquo; cards. During the game you&rsquo;ll use your chosen Action cards to gain information about opponents&rsquo; cards, and tactically position your cards to confound your opponents and open up new Actions for you to use. The game ends immediately after all the Evidence is collected.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Gameplay Overview&#10;&#10;Each player has the same 8 Action cards. They are each numbered with the Time &ndash; 1 a.m. up to 8 a.m. This Time doubles as the card&rsquo;s value in points if it scores at the end of the game. Players will choose 5 cards to play with each game, keeping their choices secret. &#10;The game begins with a shared Evidence pool and every player with five face-down hidden cards: three forming a Front Line row and two making a Back Office row. In a 3- or 4-player game, there is also a Chief&rsquo;s Badge in the centre of play that is given to a player whenever they lose a card.&#10;&#10;In turn, players take up to 2 unique actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Collect an Evidence&#10;     Accuse an opponent&rsquo;s card&#10;     Use a particular card from your Front Line (Players can use 2 different cards on their turn, just not the same one twice).&#10;&#10;&#10;Or they can spend BOTH actions to:&#10;&#10;     Cover their tracks (rearrange 3 of their cards and flip them upside down again)&#10;     Claim the Chief&rsquo;s badge from another player, or use the Chief&rsquo;s badge as any card action (In 3- 4-player games).&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Early in the game, players will primarily collect Evidence and use their Front Line cards to gain information. Later, they&rsquo;ll manipulate setups and try to use Evidence to eliminate cards from play. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Evidence&#10;&#10;Collecting Evidence is crucial to victory, because you need it to make accusations. By itself, Evidence is worth 1 point for every 2 you have. But if you successfully use one to accuse an opponent, it goes into your Evidence Locker and is worth a full point. If you accuse incorrectly, however, the Evidence goes to your opponent.  &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Accusations&#10;To win you&rsquo;ll need to reduce your opponents&rsquo; score by eliminating their high value cards. You can make random guesses, but that wastes both valuable Evidence and actions. Instead, you&rsquo;ll want to spend actions using your cards to get information first. Then just before they cover their tracks to remove what you know, you make an accusation. If you&rsquo;re right the Evidence doubles in value to a full point. But if you&rsquo;re wrong, it&rsquo;s lost to your opponent. Or worse, if you mis-accuse their Red Herring card, they get an additional Evidence from the pool.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Using a card&#10;&#10;You can use any card that&rsquo;s still hidden in your Front line &ndash; but be careful! Don&rsquo;t point at it, flip it, or do anything that might indicate WHICH card you&rsquo;re using. Unless, that is, you&rsquo;re trying to mislead your opponent.&#10;&#10;The low value/Time cards are powerful actions, as they will get you solid information like the Time difference between 2 cards of an opponent, or which cards in their Front line have &ldquo;finger-prints&rdquo; on them. This will help you deduce their cards, while other actions like the Frame-up, provide you with tactical moves to reposition some of your &ndash; or an opponent&rsquo;s &ndash; cards. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Bluffing?&#10;&#10;In the basic game you are only able to take the actions of cards you legitimately have in your Front Line. This provides a more deduction and tactical game. However, optional bluffing rules allow players to take any action they wish &ndash; legal or not. But be careful that your opponent doesn&rsquo;t call you out that you&rsquo;re lying, or you&rsquo;ll start losing cards! &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Covering your tracks&#10;&#10;As your valuable cards and actions are revealed by opponents, or as they gain more information, you&rsquo;ll want to get a little breathing room. Covering your tracks may take your whole turn but it lets you choose 3 of your cards (Front line or in your reserved Back Office) to hide again and place wherever you like. It&rsquo;s a great way to get back in the game, or foil an opponent before they have the chance to accuse you.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;The Chief&rsquo;s badge&#10;The Chief would prefer that her detectives are focused on other criminal matters, and so in 3- and 4-player games, whenever a player loses a card to an accusation they receive the Chief&rsquo;s badge for protection. A player with the Chief&rsquo;s badge cannot be accused, and can use both their actions to activate the badge as any card &ndash; in play or not.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;End of the Game&#10;&#10;Once the last Evidence token is claimed, the game ends. It&rsquo;s a timer, as once collected, Evidence never re-enters the central pool. &#10;Players score most of their points from the highest card they managed to keep hidden in their Front Line at the end of the game. Note that the Dirty Secret card is valued at 4 a.m., but if IT is the scoring card (highest one hidden), it scores an extra 7 points. The trick, of course, is making sure it&rsquo;s both hidden AND the highest Time in the front at game-end.&#10;&#10;Each Players also score points for their collected Evidence&#10;&#10;&#10;     1 per 2 unused Evidence&#10;     1 per Evidence in locker (used to successfully accuse)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Summary&#10;&#10;Dirty Little Secrets is a game of &lsquo;playing the player&rsquo; as much as it is a game about your card-play. Good players are highly responsive to their opponents, and learn to push and prod player behaviours to their favour. With only 8 cards, it&rsquo;s not about having the right card &ndash; it&rsquo;s about knowing when and how to use it.&#10;&#10;For rookies, there is a suggested set of cards to use that have more straight-forward actions that let these players be effective until they learn some of their own tricks and strategies.&#10;&#10;",

The player draws a quotation card and an accent card and then has 30 seconds to read the quotation while trying to imitate that accent to the best of their ability. Afterwards, the players' team mates have one attempt to guess the accent and score a point. Under the All option, the other teams may also try and guess.&#10;&#10;",

In this turn teams deploy their game. It&rsquo;s divided in two phases: Initiative and Replica.&#10;&#10;In this type of turn, the manager will start the Initiative phase by playing cards from hand (cost of cards is paid by field players), activating player special abilities and/or interacting with strategy cards previously deployed and style cards(They are deployed from the beginning). What is more, the cost in minutes of every played card will be increase the total minutes of the match. The Initiative phase ends when he stops playing cards or abilities.&#10;&#10;After that the opponent Manager will play a replica phase, in which he could carry a similar phase up to the maximum of minutes played in the Initiative phase by the opponent. Taking into account that some of the cards can only be played in the initiative phase(marked with an icon in the cost). This phase means the opponent is playing and deploying its strategy, not just waiting looking at the match.&#10;&#10;2) Highlight turn: It represents what is amazing in a match , those scenes we watch in the TV match summaries. Contains up to two phases, attack phase and a possible counterattack phase(or even more than one).&#10;&#10;Phase attack begins with the manager with initiative increasing the time in one minute. Beginning from him the following possibilities are gonna be played. a) Fast action card from hand b) Abilities from strategy card previously deployed c) Player abilities.

Three weeks before his defeat at Hastings, King Harold Godwinson surprised his brother Tostig and King Harald Hardrada of Norway and won a decisive, if costly victory against the Vikings.&#10;&#10;At the heart of the game is a simple turn structure in which players choose two phases to perform: Retreat, Shield Wall, Move, or Combat. Players can also perform two Move Phases in a single turn, two separate Combat phases, or a more powerful-- if bloody-- Pitched Combat. Combat resolution is quick and accurately represents the brutal, costly nature of linear warfare of the period.&#10;&#10;As leadership of the Viking forces passes from one leader to another, the rules of the game are changed, imparting a sense of historical narrative while giving both players an equal chance of victory.&#10;&#10;",

Of course, every soul has a different value.&#10;&#10;Each more valuable souls obtained, these lords will be send to the higher plane.&#10;&#10;Every two hundred years a new Lord is chosen to lead each clan, the former is judged by the Guardians of Destiny (Major Arcana) .Only the Lord that influenced a more relevant number of souls is taken to the heavenly realm, the rest is exiled to the world lower from where never they can leave.&#10;&#10;When a lord is chosen to achieve the heavenly realm, all the souls of his clan accompany it, however, the clan members of the exiled Lords do not follow the underworld actually their souls are recycled, and a new opportunity is thrown up the time when their souls are part of the winning clan and can be elevated to the higher plane.&#10;&#10;There is also a fifth clan, Corvullus, this clan is the representative of the creatures of the underworld, every two hundred years a new Demon Lord is chosen to lead it, if this creature emerge victorious conquest a whole principality in the underworld if she loses , is chained and tortured for all eternity in the catacombs of the King of the Underworld, Luxus the dark lord. Often these lords are the same defeated in previous years. If this clan is the winner, the souls of all lords go to the underworld. Therefore, although it is a great honor to become a clan of Lord, is both a great burden because their failure condemn him for all eternity. This game is set in the years 1200 - 1400 DC, so the lords are trying to influence souls of the medieval period.&#10;&#10;Game-play summary:&#10;&#10;The game can be played 2-4 players, each one will control a Lord of one of the clans, the clans have its own characteristics to play the game.&#10;&#10;Each player uses a book that contains several cards that will change the game, with conditions, influence and destination cards. These cards will affect the souls of the board directly.&#10;In the setup, before beginning of the first round, there will be a draft among the players to get the Majors Arcana Cards, these cards change instantly or permanently the conditions of the game.&#10;&#10;Each round 5 new souls will be revealed in &quot;Souls Nursery&quot; in this place players will be able to see who offers to influence souls when the soul is with an established influence it will incarnate.&#10;&#10;On earth the soul will pass to three phases, past, present and future.&#10;&#10;The game ends after the first player intended seven souls, the one who gets the most soul points wins.&#10;&#10;",

This fog destroys everything in its path, leaving behind it a world plunged into chaos. Nobody knows the exact extent of the damage. The Fog concentrates as it settles over the areas it hits, making them dangerous, almost impassable, and infested with threatening mutants.&#10;&#10;Indeed, the vast majority of the population seems to have been infected by the Fog. Those who were not killed have been contaminated to the point of transforming into violent and ruthless creatures with superhuman abilities. Their only motivation appears to be the constant hunt of the survivors.&#10;&#10;Will you survive the Fog, unpredictable and ever changing, throughout the 12 scenarios of the game? Getting out of this tainted and contaminated Boston will not be an easy task.&#10;&#10;Embody one of the brave survivors of the cataclysm: John (&ldquo;The Eye&rdquo;), the criminal with unerring accuracy; B-Mama, the paranoid, baseball-bat-wielding couch potato in need of anger management; Smokey, the specialist in maintaining the more dangerous parts of the city&rsquo;s underbelly; or Mia, the prodigy chemistry student.&#10;&#10;Together, you will progress across the modular gameboard, searching for equipment, swapping objects with one another, looting chemical storage facilities in order to mix up concoctions for various uses, and most of all, fight the Fog and the mutants it created.&#10;&#10;Be careful where you step: The Fog is thicker in some more contaminated areas, rife with mutants &mdash; stronger mutants. In order to avoid contamination, or a worse fate, you will also need to anticipate what surprises the Fog holds for you next, as you search or fumble through the map tiles darkened by its presence.&#10;&#10;By making use of clandestine Bio-Hacker labs, you will be able to create cocktails of chemical reagents to suit any purpose: decontaminating areas; healing or decontaminating yourselves; attacking, freezing, confusing, or even controlling mutants! Best of all, though, is to kill them before they can fight back through nasty dice combos and special abilities, such as accelerated mutation, teleportation, regeneration, or contamination.&#10;&#10;Enjoy an even more immersive experience by using the ZNA App, which provides game help, interactive scenarios, a map editor, storytelling, and more! Hack BioCorp&rsquo;s Drones, and scan map tiles using augmented reality through your smartphone or tablet.&#10;&#10;Discover the different game modes: Adventure, Siege, Escape, and all their original mechanisms.&#10;&#10;Survive an epic story in a devastated urban environment.&#10;&#10;Welcome to ZNA!&#10;&#10;",

Green cards are essentially the trump or the most powerful cards. The player to the right of the dealer goes first, often times they want to play cards with less power to get a good idea of the strength in everyone else's hand.&#10;&#10;The player who took the previous trick then plays, or &quot;leads,&quot; a new card for the second trick. After all tricks have been taken, their point values are totaled and the winner declared.&#10;&#10;",

No Lookie's roots are in the line of games like Golf or Polish Poker but brings a variety of new mechanics that offer the modern gaming experience to a vintage, time-tested archetype.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to have the lowest score each round.  A hand consists of five cards dealt faced down to each player.  Without looking at the cards, players arrange their hand into two faced down rows in front of them:  a top row of two cards and a bottom row of three cards.  The rest of the deck is placed in the center of the table as a draw pile.  The top card is turned over and starts the discard pile.&#10;&#10;Gameplay follows with draw-discard turns.  Players are allowed to look at the bottom-row cards prior to their first turn, but are not allowed to look at their cards again until the end of the round (except when discarding of course).  Various action cards may be discarded to trade, swap, or effect gameplay.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, the two rows score points and the player with the lowest score receives a victory point card.  For scoring: each card in the top row adds its numerical value to the player&rsquo;s score; if all three cards on the bottom row match numerically then all the cards in the bottom row score zero, but if all three cards do not match numerically then each card in the bottom row adds its numerical value to the player&rsquo;s score as they do on the top row.&#10;&#10;1 deck plays up to 6 players&#10;2 decks play up to 12 players&#10;&#10;73 Cards per deck:&#10;&#10;    51 Number Cards&#10;    2 Wild Cards&#10;    13 Action Cards&#10;    7 Victory Point Cards&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Or was it that trouble-maker Hermes? Oh My Gods! is a fast-paced game of mystery, mischief, and deduction. Race against your friends to search for clues, uncover hidden gods, and use their almighty powers. But watch out for the angry Zeus &ndash; he&rsquo;s on the prowl and is ready to zap your game!&#10;&#10;In Oh My Gods!, players are each dealt a hand of cards to help deduce who the thief is. Each player's hand consists of a few gods - these are the gods with alibis. With twenty possible suspects, players must exchange information in order to find the god with no alibi. Information is tracked on a score card that each player keeps hidden.&#10;&#10;Each god also has their own power that players can use in order to find out more information. But watch out! Using a god's power gives your opponents a lot of valuable information and can leave you with fewer cards in your hand.&#10;&#10;Be the first player to correctly figure out the thief god and you win the game. Be careful, because if you're wrong, you lose and are out for the remainder of the game!&#10;&#10;",

They try to prevent space contamination.&#10;&#10;Solarius Mission is a very eclectic game &ndash; it is important to think ahead and to optimize the personal strategy. Who acts especially prudent, who will win in the end?&#10;&#10;Solarius Mission is a tactical and strategic civilization game in a pulp science-fiction setting, with a dice-draft, dice manipulation, and resource-management mechanism. It can best be described as a mid-weight euro-style game.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Bushido is a game of savage battles, of cunning stratagems and last-ditch defences, and where debts of honour are paid in blood. In Bushido, the fate of the world hangs not on armies but on individual heroes, men and women of extraordinary capacity, attuned to the all-permeating life force known as Ki. This force is the very fabric of the universe, and those with the appropriate training or natural talent can tap into this energy source and gain seemingly superhuman powers. In the world of Bushido, the delicate tapestry of Ki &ndash; and thus the universe itself &ndash;is threatened by the forces of imbalance, and it is up to you to protect it &ndash; or help rip it apart. In a game of Bushido, nothing less than the universe itself is at stake. Are you ready for the challenge of the Way of the Warrior?&#10;&#10;There are currently nine factions at war within the Jwar Isles:&#10;&#10;The prefecture of Ryu&#10;The Dragon Clan won the rights to colonize the Westward Isles in a series of duels with their rivals, the Shiho Clan. However, when the Emperor's vessel expired, and his young heir, too young and inexperienced to concern himself with the petty disputes at the fringes of his lands, the promise of sole settlement rights died with him. The newly formed Prefecture of Ryu found themselves yet again in conflict with their old enemies, the Shiho Clan. Now, the Prefecture&rsquo;s grasp of power is weakened, due to the recent Tsunami. Their forces are in disarray, they are fighting on all fronts in the aftermath of the disaster. But still the men and women of the Dragon are ready to take their place at Destiny&rsquo;s table, uniting the human world by defending it against all threats.&#10;&#10;The Temple of Ro-Kan&#10;The serene martial artist masters of the Ro-Kan have long viewed themselves as above all mortal and mundane conflicts. Now, following the Han civil war, the rise of the Cult of Yurei, and the incursion of the Savage Wave, the monks of Ro-Kan are being dragged into the clandestine wars of universal balance &ndash; a war in which they will reluctantly turn out to be key players. The monks follow an age-old path and know the secrets of Ki better than any others, but they are few and divided &ndash; will they be able to unite and join forces before it is too late?&#10;&#10;The Savage Wave&#10;They take the form of evil creatures of myth and folklore. From where they come or why, no-one knows, but one thing is for certain, the wave crushes everything in its path. The Oni and Bakemono demon-creatures that make up the bulk of the Savage Wave appear bent on the destruction of humankind and all that is holy, but they are not mindless &ndash; as many opponents have found out at great pain, the Savage Wave is cunning and organized, and it operates according to its own weird and unknowable logic. Some mad hermits and outcast scholars whisper that this is not the first Savage Wave...&#10;&#10;The Cult of Yurei&#10;In the shadows and dark corners of the world, the worshippers of Yurei are gathering force. The many members of this Cult may not even be aware that they are serving the same dark masters, but serve them they do &ndash; the Yurei Bargain, which in its various forms allows control over life and death, has proven a temptation to many different people who would otherwise have nothing in common. In the Cult of Yurei, you may think yourself the master of your own Fate but you are always advancing the unfathomable goals of dark unseen masters. Even a puppet master has someone pulling his strings...&#10;&#10;The Ito&#10;The Ito have long been the laughing stock of the ruling clans. Never quite able to understand that it is their own flaws which hold their greater ambitions back. Being untrustworthy is synonymous with the Ito in the Jwar Isles; their support of the Shiho&rsquo;s rise to power followed by their treacherous role in the Dragon Wars against the very same clan, highlights their fickle nature. Now though the Ito on the island of Izu have gone through a transformation, their alliance with an age old and powerful Kami has imbued them with a new found strength. If it was the Kami that caused the snake like changes or whether it has simply exaggerated the Ito&rsquo;s natural affinity is unknown. What is sure is that the Ito finally have the power to rise against the other clans and avenge the mockery and mistreatment they have suffered. Will this venomous clan prove to be one dose of poison too much for the Jwar Isles?&#10;&#10;Silvermoon Trade Syndicate&#10;The thriving port of Jima is the beating heart of the Silvermoon Trade Syndicate&rsquo;s operations. For generations the merchants of the syndicate have been the trade life blood of the Jwar isles. From the great gambling halls, where fortunes are won or lost, on the roll of a single dice or the draw of a card. A bustling and bountiful harbour brimming with exotic goods and rare delights. Famed arenas where colossal Jumo warriors clash in a brutal dance, or an array of fighting beasts struggle in a battle to the death. Water houses where ones wildest fantasies can become reality with the touch of a Rose. Their power lies not the in military might of the Ito, Takashi or Minimoto but in the stranglehold they have on trade. And not only the trade of goods, but of the secrets and whispers of even the most pious. Some would liken the Silvermoon to the flip of a coin. Pay your debts and you come up in the sun with the fortunes smiling, cross or try to cheat them and you&rsquo;ll be in the dark and covered in dirt.&#10;&#10;Tengu Descension&#10;For countless cycles the elders of the mountain have watched and waited, their quiet vigil in the high places of the world unbroken. Silently they have over seen the rise and fall of innumerable clans, the petty squabbles of mortals bare no relevance to their goal. Gifted with generations of knowledge passed down through the written teachings of the Karasu Shugenja and oral histories of the Koroko Shisai the Tengu hold the secrets of the world in the their high homes.&#10;&#10;Now stirred into action, one can only imagine the danger that looms that has rustled the Tengu to war.&#10;&#10;Jung Pirates&#10;When years passed without word of the Jung, they were considered lost, their return under the mon of the giant squid surprised everyone. They have reaped what they need from the traders on the seas of the Jwar Isles, forcing the Shiho to label them pirates. Their fleets are faster and their knowledge of the Isles&rsquo; waters are unparalleled by all but perhaps the Carp clan, allowing them to evade the larger, less experienced junks of the Prefecture. Long years away from the courts of the Jwar Isles have left the Jung rough around the edges but they have not forgotten their ancestry.&#10;&#10;Kage Kaze Zoku&#10;The Kage Kaze Zoku (Shadow wind clan) are deadly ninjas with a grudge against just about everybody.&#10;&#10;",

With the promise of her famous fruit salad, Ama sends her grandchildren down to the Damnoen Saduak Floating Market to collect fruit... and to get out of her hair! Collecting different fruit is no easy task, as the fruit boats &ndash; full of mango, banana, papaya, guava, grapefruit, rambutan, and the famous starfruit &ndash; are constantly shifting around the Khlong Damnoen Saduak Canal of Thailand.&#10;&#10;In Floating Market, the players are Ama's eager grandchildren, competing to be the first to collect five different types of fruit for Ama... AND get the first bowl of fruit salad! Each player has customers (Ama&rsquo;s grandchildren), which they will assign to fruit boats (to collect fruit) and to buildings (to receive special abilities). Each player will also add a die to the dice pool each round in an attempt to influence a die roll that determines which fruit boat will hand out fruit.&#10;&#10;Floating Market utilizes polyhedral dice, worker placement, and dice speculation to create a unique and accessible experience for gamers of all levels. The rules and turns are simple and intuitive and the game teaches quickly, making it perfect for a family or group of new gamers. Experienced gamers will appreciate the unique blend of new and familiar mechanics and the quick, fun gameplay that uses polyhedral dice in a new and interesting way.&#10;&#10;",

Boys, do you know what her most embarrassing moment was? Girls, are you ready to admit whether you find his jokes funny?&#10;&#10;Players split in teams, usually by couples. In turns, you draw one question card from the corresponding deck (boys or girls) and read out loud the question given by the die roll. Then, all partners write down what they guess their mates would answer before they actually do. Finally you go team by team answering the question and revealing if it matches what the partner has written. Be prepared to be open and honest and don't spare your blushes as it could win you valuable points.&#10;&#10;If there is a match, you score the question. Simple yes-or-no questions score 1 point, multiple given choice score 2 points and open-answer questions score 3 points. Round ends and it's turn for next player.

Ragnar&ouml;k has come, and it&rsquo;s the end of the world! It&rsquo;s the Vikings&rsquo; last chance to go down in a blaze of glory and secure their place in Valhalla at Odin&rsquo;s side! For a Viking there are many pathways to glory. You can invade and pillage the land for its rewards, crush your opponents in epic battles, fulfill quests, increase your clan's stats, or even die gloriously either in battle or from Ragnar&ouml;k, the ultimate inescapable doom.&#10;&#10;Most player strategies are guided by the cards drafted at the beginning of each of the three game rounds (or Ages). These &ldquo;Gods&rsquo; Gifts&rdquo; grant you numerous boons for your clan including: increased Viking strength and devious battle strategies, upgrades to your clan, or even the aid of legendary creatures from Norse mythology. They may also include various quests, from dominating specific provinces, to having lots of your Vikings sent to Valhalla. Most of these cards are aligned with one of the Norse gods, hinting at the kind of strategy they support. For example, Thor gives more glory for victory in battle, Heimdall grants you foresight and surprises, Tyr strengthens you in battle, while the trickster Loki actually rewards you for losing battles, or punishes the winner.&#10;&#10;Players must choose their strategies carefully during the draft phase, but also be ready to adapt and react to their opponents&rsquo; strategies as the action phase unfolds. Battles are decided not only by the strength of the figures involved, but also by cards played in secret. By observing your opponent&rsquo;s actions and allegiances to specific gods, you may predict what card they are likely to play, and plan accordingly. Winning battles is not always the best course of action, as the right card can get you even more rewards by being crushed. The only losing strategy in Blood Rage is to shy away from battle and a glorious death!&#10;&#10;",

Oil, minerals and crops are produced and if sold via the Atlantic port of Matadi, players reap rich rewards. Players develop their own cities and hydroelectricity can be sold to these.&#10;&#10;The game is built in four game layers with layer two introducing insurgents and peacekeepers, layer three the Government, and layer four strategic interventions by other countries.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a map showing the eleven provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and their &quot;capital&quot; towns. Transport routes are shown and include the major rivers and railways and export routes. In a turn a player may carry out one of five actions: build industry, place transport, develop city, produce resources, or sell resources. A neat and tidy economic game is made complicated by the presence of insurgents at game start, and these are suppressed and eliminated by use of players peacekeepers. This is a typical Ragnar Brothers dice combat system&mdash;simple but bringing tension and fun to proceedings.&#10;&#10;",

Whoever finishes first is the winner. There are also cards what add or substract the movements of players&acute;s pawns in this game.&#10;&#10;A crowd-funded &lsquo;patriotic&rsquo; board game about reclaiming Estonia after a Russian invasion has become a hit in the Baltic state, feeding on popular fears about the geopolitical ambitions of the country&rsquo;s eastern neighbor.&#10;&#10;Named &lsquo;Comrade Pu conquers Estonia&rsquo; &ndash; the monicker is a popular local nickname for Vladimir Putin &ndash; the board game features a recognizable caricature of the Russian president on the front of its box, though it does not mention him by name.&#10;&#10;In a variant of Snakes and Ladders, the players have to &lsquo;fight back&rsquo; from the Western border of the state, which became independent from the Soviet Union in 1991, with the help of dice. Instead of ladders, players pull out cards that may help or hinder their progress. &ldquo;Pu wins the Nobel Peace Prize&rdquo; sets the player one step back, while &ldquo;Kazakhstan is prevented from joining Russia&rsquo;s side&rdquo; lets them get one ahead.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;The idea of the game was born during the events of last spring in Ukraine,&rdquo; Taavi Emajoe told the Russian-language Delfi website in Estonia. &ldquo;We hope people find the game humorous. There is nothing unethical about political satire.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Emajoe, who was working on another game with two other young designers, before the spark of inspiration, says the game wouldn&rsquo;t have worked without Putin.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;We chose Putin not to create animosity towards him, but because he is such a multi-dimensional political figure. Most of the ideas in the game are derived directly from his persona.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;After easily passing the &euro;1,500 (US$1,734) funding requirement on the local version of Kickstarter, the game has now hit the shelves, retailing at &euro;23.45 ($27).&#10;&#10;The manager of Tallinn&rsquo;s leading Apollo bookshop, Liis Paas, told Delfi that the game has been &ldquo;attracting a heightened level of attention&rdquo; from curious shoppers. However, the manager did not elaborate whether interest had transformed into sales.&#10;&#10;Estonia is historically sensitive about being invaded by the Soviet Union in 1940, following the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, and local politicians still frequently evoke the specter of a Russian invasion, despite the country being a member of NATO and the EU.&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, satirical board games about Putin &ndash; often based on Snakes and Ladders &ndash; have previously appeared in Russian and Western media following a whirlwind year for the Kremlin, mostly as playful illustrations, not actual games to be played with pieces and dice.&#10;&#10;Satirical board games have enjoyed a mixed history, with acclaim depending largely on the players&rsquo; political orientation. The US board game War on Terror &ndash; which satirizes US foreign policy and forces players to temporarily don balaclavas as they face American wrath &ndash; is still popular, while the pre-WWII Juden Raus, in which German players had to &ldquo;round up Jews&rdquo; and &ldquo;push them off the board&rdquo; enjoys a different sort of notoriety.&#10;&#10;",

Cannons and rifles had become more accurate at longer ranges, rapid-fire pistols gave cavalry a new weapon, and the telegraph and railroad completely altered both strategic and tactical thinking. Across a Deadly Field, the new regimental-level war game from Osprey Publishing, allows players to recreate this tumultuous period of warfare on the tabletop. Its versatile rules make it possible to refight any battle, from the early skirmishes of Ball's Bluff and Big Bethel to the grand, set-piece battles such as Gettysburg that decided the war. Written by John Hill, designer of the Johnny Reb series, Across a Deadly Field offers both new and experienced war gamers a fast-paced and dynamic game where even a single regiment can make the difference between victory and defeat.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "From the introduction:&#10;&#10;One of the biggest problems facing wargamers is finding the time to actually play. Most commercially available sets of rules require several hours to set up and play to a conclusion; some can easily swallow up a whole day or weekend. For many gamers this means that their lavishly prepared miniature armies rarely get used at all. Apart from time, the other consideration is space, which further constrains the opportunities for a game. In One-hour Wargames, veteran gamer and rule-writer Neil Thomas has addressed both these problems. Now it is practical to play a game in around an hour on a normal dining table or living room floor. The book contains 8 (all-new) sets of very simple rules for various periods, from Ancient to WW2 and 30 scenarios which can be played using any of them, so you don't even have to take too much time thinking up a stimulating tactical situation and objectives. All the rules and scenarios are intended to be played on a 3ft x 3ft battlefield. The rules only require a small number of miniatures, so this really is an ideal way for new gamers, or veterans trying a new period, to get started with minimal investment of time and money. Also ideal for a quick game in the evening when a friend pops round. There are also sections on campaigns and solo games.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "A humorous party game for 3-8 players. Players take on the role of a Psycho!Therapist and attempt to treat people with problems ranging from weird to WTF?!&#10;&#10;This game is like something out of Whose Line Is It Anyway, and Machine of Death.&#10;&#10;Components&#10;Cards: There are a variety of cards in Psycho!Therapist. Each is described below:&#10;TYPE Cards: These cards have adjectives that describe the way the client presents themselves, such as Angry, Friendly, Groggy, etc. &#10;CLIENT Cards: These cards typically identify your client&rsquo;s occupation, such as Doctor, Lawyer, Ice Cream Truck Driver, etc.  &#10;PROBLEM Cards: These cards provide a description of the kind of problem the client has, such as a phobia, being on probation, or medical illness that is related to the behavior. &#10;BEHAVIOR Cards: These cards describe the specific action the person is taking that is deviant, dangerous, dysfunctional, or causes distress such as: Giving play by play commentary on other people&rsquo;s behavior, doing inappropriate things on the copy machine, or poking an eye out (Mama told you it would happen!)&#10;TOOL Cards: These cards list objects, some very specific (a 10 foot pole) and others up the players imagination (something that begins with the letter B) that the player uses to enhance their chances of a successful treatment. These also contain a modifier (+5, +10+) which is added to their dice roll to determine success or failure. &#10;DICE: The dice included in the set are called Percentile Dice. There is a tens dice and a ones dice. The scores range from 01 to 100 (a roll of 00,0). Thus a roll of 40 on the tens dice and 7 on the ones dice equals a result of 47%. &#10;MODIFIER Cards: these are double sided, with +10 (in green) on one side and -10 (in red) on the other. These are used when players either make exceptionally good rolls (critical success) or exceptionally bad rolls (critical failures).They only last until they are played on their next turn.  &#10;GAMEBOARD and PLAY MATS&#10;The Mats are included to help you keep score in terms of Therapeutic Successes, Therapeutic Failures, and to keep track of the Tools you use.&#10;&#10;The Base Mechanic: Players will come up with imaginative treatments for the clients described in the game. Patients are made up of a Type, Client, Problem, and Behavior. So when creating a random patient for the game, you draw one of each card and place them together (Game mode determines if they are laid out in the center of the board, or stacked with only the TYPE card on top face up). &#10;All patients have a Base Chance of Success of 50% to start (though this can decrease if a Player fails in their attempt at Psycho!Therapy). Players then describe their treatment plan with the patient in an attempt to cure them. Using the Tools adds to the chance of the Players success. Players will rarely have more than 3 Tools, but the bonuses are cumulative. Whenever Tools are used, they modify the Base Chance of Success (hence, a player using all three tools that have +5 modifiers now has a 65% chance of success). &#10;Once the treatment plans have been described (and in some modes the Clinical decides which player&rsquo;s treatment plan sounds best), the modifiers from the Tools are added together, the player rolls the dice and tries to get the target number or below in order to have a therapeutic success. &#10;So if Player 1 had used all three tools and gained a +15, they would need to roll 65 or less on the percentile dice (50% Base Chance + 15 from the Tools = 65% chance of success).&#10;&#10;A Role-playing Suggestion:&#10;&#10;    Completely Optional but very fun: Instead of just drawing the cards and focusing on the solution, the game can be a lot more fun when other players decide to improvise things the client might say or do. Remember that they will generally be compliant with the therapist and the use of tools (refer to the Type cards &ndash; hence, in the case of a Belligerent Client, the therapist might just have to make them use the tools despite their stubbornness, a Shy client might have to be coaxed or encouraged to use them). This opens the window to some really funny one-liners and statements!&#10;&#10;&#10;  Also, don&rsquo;t be afraid to invent other objects that help place the Tools in context. You can certainly use other things besides your tools, they just don&rsquo;t add to your chances of Therapeutic Success (see the example in the next column where Mark used an emergency air mask). &#10;When Tools are generic, such as &ldquo;a flask containing a liquid&rdquo;, you get to choose all the details!.&#10; To help with the characterization of the patient, think of any stereotypes about the Client first. Then, think of what would be frustrating to them about their job. What would they complain about? This is a good way to get a funny initial feel for the Client. You can even name them if you want!&#10;&#10;Winning And Losing The Game&#10;See the different modes for specific win/lose conditions. In general, the game continues until a Psycho!Therapist reaches 4 Therapeutic Successes, or there are no more clients to treat (either all in jail or have become Serial Killers). &#10;Alternate Rule #2 (for Court Ordered or Dark Mode): If having no winner bothers you, the person with the most Therapeutic Successes when the game stops is considered the winner.&#10;&#10;",

The dastardly dingo has stormed your burrow and chased away 4 of your baby wombats! You will need to eat and digest food in order to produce poop cubes, with which you will build smell areas so you can navigate your environment, find your baby wombats, and bring them home. The player who best plans their smell areas and moves most efficiently will prove victorious!&#10;&#10;The object of Wombat Rescue is to be the first player to find all 4 of your baby wombats and bring them home.&#10;&#10;",

You decide how your character will spend their actions, collect their resources and ultimately build their commendations to score enough points to be considered the true 'captain' of the very first 5H class ship in the space fleet. The running time is approximately 60-90 minutes for a full four player game.&#10;&#10;",

The other represents the &quot;turtle&quot; and replaces the single pip face with an image of a turtle.&#10;&#10;This is a straightforward press your luck game.  On your turn, you roll the two dice, note the point total, and you have the option to roll both dice again to attempt to add more points to your turn's total.  You can choose to stop after any roll and add your points to the turn to your overall game's total.  However, if you roll a &quot;lobster&quot; or a &quot;turtle,&quot; you lose all points for the turn and your turn ends.  One final twist: if you roll both a &quot;lobster&quot; and a &quot;turtle,&quot; you immediately add 50 points to your turn's score, you add your turn's score to your overall total, and your turn immediately ends. The first player to 200 points is the winnter.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "THIS GAME IS A PRINT AND PLAY GAME.  DOWNLOAD IS FREE AND ALL REQUIRED FILES ARE AVAILABLE BELOW&#10;&#10;Vikings: Long Ships in the Mist is a Euro game with historical flavor, covering the heart of the Viking Age, 800 to 950 AD.  Players must carefully balance the two primary options they have each turn: plundering for quick riches; or attempting to settle and control provinces on the map.  Areas that are settled and controlled by a player produce income and are worth victory points.&#10;&#10;Movement is simple.  Combat entails a little more chrome than most Euro games, and features what simulations usually refer to as a Combat Resolution Table, where a roll of two dice is cross-referenced on a table listing the attacker's odds and various potential results, including the possibility of success from a low-odds Berserker attack!&#10;&#10;A major feature of the game is a random events table, which guarantees no two games will be alike.  The list of possible events range from plagues and enticing defection by an opposing player's unit, to significant historical events like the division of the Carolingian Empire, the development of French tactics against Viking attacks, the Magyar invasions, Alfred the Great's revolt against Viking rule, and Otto the Great's attempts to expel Vikings from areas of the Holy Roman Empire.&#10;&#10;An interest in history is the main reason I got into gaming.  So even non-simulation games like &quot;Imperial&quot; appeal to me in a way fantasy games do not. I designed VIKINGS with two goals in mind: 1) creating a game that takes no longer to play than most Euro games; and 2) a game that offers more historical references and flavor than most Euro games (with maybe a measure of historical plausibility).  For instance, I put some study into determining which cities were significant and which were walled and fortified in this period, and included significant historical events in list of random events - some of which are more likely to occur than other, non-historical events.&#10;&#10;Please leave feedback on the forum with suggestions for potential revisions.  Hope you enjoy it!&#10;&#10;",

The Alliance's attempt to revive the worlds that were destroyed during the Purge was met with great success and the future looks bright for the first time. Those sectors that were abandoned before, have now become very active and are blooming with life.&#10;&#10;Due to the increased traffic, the construction of new Stations in the area was deemed necessary. Once again, the alien races rush to build the best Space Station, in order to take advantage of the new opportunities that arise. To that end, Advisors are being sent by the Alliance to assist in the construction.&#10;&#10;Among the Stars: Revival, a new expansion for Among the Stars, can also be played as a standalone game for two players! This game features new mechanisms that add more interaction to the game and more things to consider when drafting a card. New elements in the game include:&#10;&#10;&#10;    30 locations: 15 Basic and 15 Special (90 Location cards in total)&#10;    New two-player rules: More strategic and skill-testing especially for two players! These rules can also be used for Among the Stars base game.&#10;    Spaceships: A new highly-interactive mechanism used by many of the new cards. It allows the players to put Spaceship tokens on the Stations, preventing anyone from building on those spaces.&#10;    Advisors: This new module, which can also be added to the Among the Stars base game, increases competition among the players in order to control Advisor cards that grant them special abilities as well as additional victory points.&#10;&#10;&#10;Among the Stars: Revival can also be enhanced by using the miniatures from the Among The Stars: Miniatures Pack (available separately).&#10;&#10;",
