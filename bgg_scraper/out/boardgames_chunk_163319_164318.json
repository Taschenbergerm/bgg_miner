        "description": "Pet Shop is a Solitaire worker placement game that involves you as the new owner of a brand new pet store selling Dogs and Cats to special clientele!  Your business must earn enough money and keep a high enough reputation by the end of 30 days or the pet shop will close. You have three main departments that are the money makers of the business: Grooming, Veterinarian, and Training.  These three departments can be run by a contractor, a trained contractor &ldquo;specialists&rdquo; or a Professional.  There are two other departments that take in new strays or donated pets and sell them once they&rsquo;ve been through the three main departments: Sales floor and the Kennels.  The last office is the Manager's Office, which is where you must be to hire new contractors or professionals, fire bad employees or send your contractor out for training to become specialist.  The office is where you control the day-to-day operations of the business.&#10;&#10;The game board shows a floor plan of the Pet Shop with all the departments and your office.  Inside the three main departments is a space for an employee token and a pet card.  In the office is a space for you and/or your Asst. Manage token.  In the Kennels there is a space for employee tokens and four pet cards.  The Sales floor has a space for employee tokens and four pet cards.  There is another building next to the Pet Shop that has a Temp Agency and an Employee Training office.  This building is used to hire new employees: contractors and Professionals.  The Employee training office takes in your contractors and trains them to be a Specialist as a Veterinarian, Groomer, or Trainer yet they are not as proficient as the true Professionals.  On the outside game border is a sidewalk with 30 spaces that represents a turn track to keep track of the 30 days you're in business.  In the middle of the board is the Reputation track to keep track of your businesses reputation.&#10;&#10;The game play is worker placement with a countdown 30 day turn tracker.  You will collect new animals or abandoned strays into your kennels but are limited to three spaces within the kennel to hold the pets, so picking the right animal is critical.  You the owner must decide which department is most important to change the new pet into money making breeds!  Each animal has a large, medium or small breed and only certain departments can be used to help improve the animals for sales.  You only start with a small non Professional staff although you the owner can run any department in the business.  You must decide who to hire, place those new hires in the most needed departments, and decide when to place them in training to help each department improve their operations.  With each animal you sell, you will earn more money to put back into the business to hire more employees, train more staff, to improve the pet quality for the customers.&#10;&#10;The customers will have specific needs such as; breed size, quality and number of pets wanted.&#10;&#10;Each day you will draw an event card which will show either a new customer walking into the store, a donated pet, a picked up stray, a business problem, or customer issues!&#10;&#10;To win the game you must maintain a certain reputation and earn enough money to stay in business for another month, if you don&rsquo;t do this you lose and your business goes OUT-OF-BUSINESS!&#10;&#10;",

The game has frequent moments of tension between peaceable moments, which can be used to defuse negative behaviors and infuse positive approaches without interrupting the flow of the game. The Advanced and Intermediate modes of play are more complicated and this may be daunting to the younger range of players.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "A doujinshi (self-published) simulation of the Battle of Dannoura in 1185 (the sea battle that brought the Genpei War in Japan to a close), Shogyoumujou (&#232;&#171;&#184;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#231;&#132;&#161;&#229;&#184;&#184;) is a Buddhist concept translated as &ldquo;the impermanence of all things&rdquo;. This is the main theme of the &ldquo;Heike Monogatari&rdquo;, a gunkimono (war tale) that gives a highly romanticized account of the war and the times that surrounded it. The book details the rise and fall of the Taira warrior house, the losing side at Dannoura. It drives home the point that &ldquo;all that flourishes must fall&rdquo; and that in a world of impermanence even the mighty are eventually reduced to &ldquo;dust before the wind&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a very fitting title, as the battle effectively ended the Taira's reign as a political and military powerhouse.&#10;&#10;It has several sub-titles that change according to the game component-the full name is Shogyoumujou: Genpei Arasoi- Setouchi No Koubou-Genpei Saigo No Kassen-Dannoura No Tatakai (&#232;&#171;&#184;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#231;&#132;&#161;&#229;&#184;&#184;: &#230;&#186;&#144;&#229;&#185;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#186;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#132;-&#231;&#128;&#172;&#230;&#136;&#184;&#229;&#134;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#148;&#187;&#233;&#152;&#178;-&#230;&#186;&#144;&#229;&#185;&#179;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#229;&#190;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#230;&#136;&#166;-&#229;&#163;&#135;&#227;&#131;&#142;&#230;&#181;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;). This mouthful of a name translates as &ldquo;Impermanence Of All Things: Genpei Strife-Offense And Defense Of The Seto Inland Sea-End of the Genpei War-Battle of Dannoura.&#10;&#10;The game features the naval forces of the Taira and Minamoto warrior houses and their assorted allies. In a strange design decision, the historical situation is somewhat reversed-the Minamoto are severely outnumbered but have stronger units than their Taira foes (the Minamoto substantially outnumbered the Taira but the crews of the Taira ships were far more experienced at sea warfare as the clan first came to power by demonstrating their prowess at fighting pirates). Perhaps this was done to reflect the Minamoto&rsquo;s lack of seaborne experience (the reduced numbers) but to show their large advantage in tactics (the increased strength)-their commander, Minamoto no Yoshitsune, purportedly ordered his archers to fire upon the rowers of the boats rather than the enemy soldiers (a violation of the unwritten rules of warfare of the day, something that Yoshitsune was notorious for throughout his career). While the game is relatively simple, it has lots of chrome rules that add historical flavor such as the effects of the changing tide on movement and combat, possession of the Imperial Regalia and the Child Emperor Antoku (both initially held by the Taira), defections, the role of leaders, and giving the Taira a couple of unique ship types. Historically, the Minamoto literally used the &lsquo;turning of the tide&rsquo; to rout the Taira and were aided by key defections during the battle as well as Yoshitsune&rsquo;s less than &lsquo;honorable&rsquo; tactics. The Taira leader, Munemori, was fished out of the ocean (where he had been thrown by an ally disgusted at his reluctance to commit suicide to avoid capture and dishonor) and eventually executed. However, the Taira denied the Minamoto a complete victory when the matriarch of the clan and her attendants jumped into the ocean with the child Emperor and the Imperial Regalia. While the Minamoto managed to recover two of the three artifacts, the child Emperor died and the sword Kusanagi was lost forever. This was a major disappointment to the Minamoto&rsquo;s alleged supporter, Retired Emperor Go-Shirakawa. The game&rsquo;s victory conditions reflect all this, factoring both the Emperor/Regalia and enemy losses into the mix. It&rsquo;s a fast (10 turns, a couple of hours) and fun play with a manageable amount of units and good balance.&#10;&#10;",

You won't get very far alone, but who knows if your friends can be trusted?&#10;&#10;In Ruinous, each player is an adventurer attempting to collect valuable items within dangerous ruins. They must brave these deadly ruins while balancing teamwork and trickery on the way to finding ancient Artifacts - powerful and expensive items that imbue their holders with unique abilities. But be careful: no item or player is safe from treachery! The first player to collect and sell at least $1000 worth of treasure and artifacts wins!&#10;&#10;When it's your turn to explore a ruin you may first assemble an adventure party made up of other players in the game. The more people you recruit, the easier it is to overcome traps and obstacles. But keep in mind, they're still your enemies! Offer them a cut of the treasure to encourage cooperation, but remember: in the depths of the world's darkest ruins there are no contracts, there are no witnesses and sometimes only one survivor... So always prepare for an opportunistic backstabbing.&#10;&#10;Should you enlist the help of your rivals or attempt to go it alone? Are your fellow adventurers trustworthy? Are you?&#10;&#10;",

HOWEVER&#10;Sprite is best enjoyed by playing in campaign mode. In campaign mode, a player creates his or her own character and uses that character to attempt to beat each Chapter in order. Chapters get progressively more challenging, but as your character gains experience, it may attain new levels. When your character attains a new level, experience points can be spent to add new spells and abilities and upgrade stats. Characters will also pick up items as they progress through Chapters and defeat monsters.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is pretty simple. The turn begins with the drawing of a mission and moving of any monsters that are on the board. The player may then take 3 actions using his or her character and/or forest animals in order to complete one of the open missions. When players fail missions, monsters get released. If 6 missions are failed, player loses. If the players draw all of the missions and fail less than 6 of them, they win (and gain experience points in campaign mode).&#10;&#10;Forest Sprite is a game full of tense decisions. (starting with creating a good character!) There are no dice (the only luck is in the order in which missions are drawn). This is a game of planning, skillful gameplay, and coordination of resources.&#10;&#10;2014 Solitaire Print and Play Contest Awards;&#10;&#10;Best Game&#10;3rd Place&#10;&#10;Best Art&#10;2nd Place&#10;&#10;Best Thematic Game&#10;2nd Place&#10;&#10;Best Large Game&#10;2nd Place&#10;&#10;Most Innovative Mechanic&#10;2nd Place (tied)&#10;&#10;",

This is most important because there are lava squares and players always need to be aware of how those tiles can change and move so they don't end up in lava and die.&#10;&#10;There are also items to take including Weapons, Armor, Potions and Boardcrafting cards. On a turn, a player can make an attack, pick up an item, as well as play a &quot;Genesis action&quot; which means they can add a tile to the board.&#10;&#10;The goal is to collect achievement points by completely missions and killing other players. Missions are randomly distributed and might be anything from collecting items, to performing in game actions such as pushing someone into water.&#10;&#10;Players can play in teams or free-for-all in completely new environments each game.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Rolling Japan is a light &quot;multiplayer solitaire&quot; dice game. Each player has a map of Japan that's divided into the 47 prefectures, which are then bunched together into six differently colored areas.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player draws two regular six-sided dice from a bag and rolls them; the bag starts with seven dice, six matching the colors of the areas on the map along with a wild purple die. All players now write down each number rolled on any prefecture of the matching color, i.e., if the blue die shows 4 and the yellow a 2, write a 4 in one blue prefecture and a 2 in one yellow prefecture. If the purple die is rolled, you can place this number in a prefecture of your choice; additionally, three times per game you can choose to use a non-purple die as any color. However, neighboring prefectures &mdash; including those in different areas connected by blue lines &mdash; can't have numbers with a difference larger than 1; if you can't place a number without breaking this rule, then you must place an X in a prefecture of the appropriate color. (If all the prefectures in an area are filled, you can ignore the die or use one of your three color changes to place the number elsewhere.)&#10;&#10;After six dice have been rolled, mark one round as being complete, then return the dice to the bag and start the next round. After eight rounds the game ends, and whoever has the fewest Xs on her map wins.&#10;&#10;",

Then, the player reveals the first Villager and assigns the Monster cards, either to the Town Locations or to the Lair, a Special location that allows the player to manipulate luck.&#10;&#10;The player must balance his or her forces in an effort to capture the required victims and avoid the nasty effects of the defending villagers.

Players will need to strategically navigate crowded Flyways and catch Strong Tailwinds while avoiding dangerous Predators, Fog and other hazards. The player with the most Migration Tokens when there are no tokens remaining wins the game.&#10;&#10;Gameplay Overview:&#10;&#10;Each turn is comprised of three phases:&#10;&#10;1) Draft Cards and Play Complete Flocks:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Each player may draft either two Birds or one Action from the Feeding Grounds. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    If a player is able to play a complete Flock(s), it may be played in any vacant, valid Flyway for that Bird type. A player may play as many complete Flocks from her hand during her turn. A player is not required to play a full Flock even if there is an open Flyway. &#10;            For example, a player may want to hold onto a complete Flock to create an even larger Flock for more points.&#10;        &#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    After drafting cards and playing any Flocks, that player refills the Feeding Grounds back up to six cards to signal her turn is complete. If the draw pile is empty, reshuffle the discard pile to form a new draw pile.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;2) Play Actions: After each player has had the opportunity to draft and play Flocks, beginning with the person with the player one token, each player may play one Action from her hand.&#10;&#10;3) Migrate: Starting with Pacific Flyway, moving in order towards the Eastern Flyway, place one Migration Token on each Flock currently in play, unless prohibited by an Action (i.e. Fog).&#10;&#10;&#10;    If the number of tokens on the Flock is equal to the Migration Time printed on the card, the Flock owner collects all Migration Tokens currently on the Flock and the Flock is then discarded. Full Flock Bonus: The owner of the Flock receives +1 additional Migration Token from the pile for each additional Bird over the required Flock size. Safety in numbers!&#10;&#10;&#10;After the Migrate phase is complete, all players must discard down to the hand limit of ten cards. The player one token is then passed clockwise, shifting the starting player for the new turn. Refill the Feeding Grounds and continue play until all Migration Points are expended.&#10;&#10;Winning the Game&#10;&#10;    When the last token is played on a Flock, the game ends immediately. Any Migration Tokens on Flocks in a Flyway go to the owner of those Flocks. Each player adds up their token and the player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In Patchwork, two players compete to build the most aesthetic (and high-scoring) patchwork quilt on a personal 9x9 game board. To start play, lay out all of the patches at random in a circle and place a marker directly clockwise of the 2-1 patch. Each player takes five buttons &mdash; the currency/points in the game &mdash; and someone is chosen as the start player.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player either purchases one of the three patches standing clockwise of the spool or passes. To purchase a patch, you pay the cost in buttons shown on the patch, move the spool to that patch's location in the circle, add the patch to your game board, then advance your time token on the time track a number of spaces equal to the time shown on the patch. You're free to place the patch anywhere on your board that doesn't overlap other patches, but you probably want to fit things together as tightly as possible. If your time token is behind or on top of the other player's time token, then you take another turn; otherwise the opponent now goes. Instead of purchasing a patch, you can choose to pass; to do this, you move your time token to the space immediately in front of the opponent's time token, then take one button from the bank for each space you moved.&#10;&#10;In addition to a button cost and time cost, each patch also features 0-3 buttons, and when you move your time token past a button on the time track, you earn &quot;button income&quot;: sum the number of buttons depicted on your personal game board, then take this many buttons from the bank.&#10;&#10;What's more, the time track depicts five 1x1 patches on it, and during set-up you place five actual 1x1 patches on these spaces. Whoever first passes a patch on the time track claims this patch and immediately places it on his game board.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the first player to completely fill in a 7x7 square on his game board earns a bonus tile worth 7 extra points at the end of the game. (Of course, this doesn't happen in every game.)&#10;&#10;When a player takes an action that moves his time token to the central square of the time track, he takes one final button income from the bank. Once both players are in the center, the game ends and scoring takes place. Each player scores one point per button in his possession, then loses two points for each empty square on his game board. Scores can be negative. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Murano the game is set in Murano, a small group of seven islands near Venice that's well-known by tourists for its glassmaking. As in Venice, the islands of Murano are separated by canals, so gondolas and transportation are at the heart of this game.&#10;&#10;The game board depicts the islands of Murano, with the islands being divided up into building sites and walkways. Surrounding the islands is a series of action spaces, with gondolas being present in some number of them at the start of play. On a turn, you move one of the gondolas in the direction of play to an empty space, then take the action shown there. You can't pass another gondola while moving or land in an occupied space, but for a coin you can move a gondola that's in front of the gondola you want to move, and you can pay to move multiple gondolas, if needed.&#10;&#10;Some actions place shops on the islands, with shops coming in different types. You mark a shop to show ownership, and when tourists show up later, they will shop at various stores depending on their proximity and the goods they offer. You also need to take actions to move your personal gondolas to islands so that you can take actions there.&#10;&#10;Why are you doing all of this activity? To score victory point cards in hand, and actions on the board will let you gain additional VP cards to give you direction to your actions or let you profit from what you've already done.&#10;&#10;You can also use some of the buildings to create glassworks, and those glassworks come into play on the VP cards, through tourist sales, and via an action space shown at the bottom of the game board image that lets you sell different types of glass for money.&#10;&#10;The Complete Edition from 2020 contains Murano: Promo Cards and Murano: The Christmas Tree packaged inside the box and may be found here: Murano: Complete Edition.&#10;&#10;",

Navigate lawsuits, price wars, networking opportunities and shock cards along the way.&#10;Unlike other business board games, Startup is a lot of fun, even when you are not winning. You lose by succeeding more slowly, not by getting crushed.&#10;&#10;The Startup board game teaches business and math skills and models many real business situations, such as the value of investing in your business, the risks and rewards of business opportunities, and the trade-offs in a Capital Opportunity or an IPO.&#10;&#10;Startup is fun for the whole family and will have your 9 year old jumping up and down thrilled to have completed an IPO!&#10;&#10;StartUp is challenging for any age from child to adult.

The first player to collect 20 (2 players), 17 (3 players), 15 (4 players) or 25 (4 player team play) Marks wins.&#10;&#10;Each player commands three pirate ships: a Man of war, a Sloop of war and a Bilander, using Movement cards to discover mystic portals, treacherous barriers, pirate bays, seamy ports and treasure islands.  Ports provide limited Shadow Trade Tokens for smuggling where each island has a unique Plunder Token that pirate ships can steal.  Plunder and Shadow Trade tokens are placed on the pirate ship.  Tokens must be safely returned to a Pirate Bay to obtain Marks of Infamy.&#10;&#10;Marks of Infamy are also rewarded by exploring one of the last seven map tiles, weathering a Pirate Luck event or successfully raiding opponent&rsquo;s pirate ships through Battle cards.  Victorious ships also gain any tokens the opposing ship was carrying.&#10;&#10;Movement cards with a cross bones symbol trigger a special event determined by a Pirate Luck card.  The Pirate Luck event affects enemy ships on a selected tile.  Players that have previously earned Pirate Luck cards can avoid the event by discarding a card or risk the evils that lay beneath.&#10;&#10;Are you ready to sail these waters?&#10;&#10;",

The heavy cavalry shed most of its armour and began to rely more and more on shock action. The infantry changed over from firing volleys by ranks and adopted the far more flexible platoon firing. Light cavalry began to make its appearance on the battlefield.&#10;&#10;Command and control was no less rudimentary. Marlborough&rsquo;s running footmen, on hand to carry his orders to all parts of the field, were the wonder of the day. A general staff, trained to act as a team, was still years in the future.&#10;And as for the name, Corporal John was the affectionate nickname given to John, first Duke of Marlborough by his troops.&#10;These rules are designed to replicate the warfare of Marlborough and Eugene, of Charles XII and Peter the Great, and of the great Cond&eacute; and Turrenne. They might easily be used for the conflicts of Cromwell and Prince Rupert or even the wars of Maurice de Saxe. Whichever you choose.&#10;All models fielded under these rules are organised on &ldquo;element&rdquo; bases. They can be of any size provided that both sides field their forces on the same size bases. There is no figure-scale as such &ndash; the gamer is free to use as many or as few figures as he wishes and the base will accommodate &ndash; and no removal of casualties.&#10;&#10;",

Such games with 1 or 2 players a side can be played comfortably in an evening.&#10;&#10;Smaller actions with a ship per player (like the Hood v. Bismark) are good for a quick fun game or as training for beginners.&#10;&#10;It is designed for multiplayer games with each player commanding either a single ship or a squadron of a few ships. The principles of the game are:&#10;1. The game is played on a hex grid. The scale of the ship models doesn&rsquo;t matter as long as they fit in a hex.&#10;2. Each ship has a ship&rsquo;s log to record proposed manoeuvres and damage. These are magnetic boards with paper overlays with details recorded by positioning magnetic counters.&#10;3. The players secretly record their proposed movement each turn.&#10;4. All the ships are then moved simultaneously in accordance with those proposals.&#10;5. Firing of main guns, secondary armament &amp; torpedoes is then resolved ship by ship.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Take on the role of a pirate in this fun game of greed and revenge attempt to build your treasure hoard as the other players attempt to pilfer your coffers but they better watch out because you are all pirates and two can play at that game.&#10;&#10;This is a good game for those that enjoy intense strategy but it is also simple and easy to learn so it is accessible for both children and advanced adult players alike. Above all it is fun there will be a lot of trash talking and grudges but no one will feel victimized for long because in this game its never long before the victim becomes predator and vice versa.&#10;&#10;Rules&#10;&#10;Object: be the first to add ten treasure cards to your hoard&#10;&#10;Setup: To start shuffle the deck and  deal 7 cards to each player&#10;&#10;Play: on your turn you draw a card then:&#10;you can play a treasure card into your hoard by placing it from your hand to the table in front of you, or plunder treasure from other peoples hoards by playing red cards, or you can play a special blue card. If you cannot play a card you must draw a card and if you still cannot play you pass to&#10;the next player.&#10;&#10;Plundering&#10; (playing red cards)&#10;when you play a red plunder card you place it in the discard pile and declare who you are stealing treasure from. &#10;   Then you can take the number of treasure cards indicated on the card 1,2,3, or 5 from the player and place it in your hoard unless they play a green defense card.&#10;    If a player has less treasure than you would take with your red plunder card you can still play that card and just take what treasure they do have.&#10;&#10;Defending     &#10;(playing green cards)&#10;when another player tries to steal treasure from your hoard with a red card you can play one of the green cards into the discard pile to defend yourself.&#10;    You can play the dodge card to avoid having to give up any treasure. You can play the block card which requires you to give half the treasure owed rounded down. So if they played a cutlass that steals 1 you give nothing and if they were to play a blunderbuss which steals 3 you would give the one. You can also play the bribe card which causes you to discard a card in addition to the bribe card to avoid having to give up any treasure. If you do not have a card to discard you cannot play a bribe card. &#10;   You can play defense cards any time someone plays&#10;a red plunder card against you and does not count as your turn. with the exception of the special treasure chest card.&#10;&#10;Special&#10;(blue cards) &#10;The blue cards are special cards you can play on your turn by putting them in the discard pile for its effect.&#10;    When you play the treasure chest card you draw three cards then your turn is over.&#10;  When you play the ruby card you put it in front of you like you would a treasure except the ruby card is worth two. Ruby cards can not be stolen. So if you had three regular treasure cards and  a ruby and someone played a cannon against you that steals 5 you would give them the three regular treasures but do not have to give them the ruby. &#10;    When you play the swift card you may play two more cards from your hand and then your turn is over. These can be any combination of yellow, red, or blue cards&#10;    .If you use a swift to play two attack cards on the same player you must play both at once and the number of cards to be stolen would be added together and count as a single attack. This means the player can defend with only one green card against the total of the attack. For instance if you were attacking for a total of 8 with two cards and they played a block, they would give four and if the played a dodge they would give nothing. If you use a swift to attack two separate people they count as two separate attacks and must be blocked separately.&#10;&#10;When all the cards in the deck have been played shuffle the discard pile and flip it over and use it as the deck to continue play.&#10;&#10;",

Not much more information is known about this edition.&#10;&#10;4th edition (1977): Board is back to the original design with ferry, in colour and a lot of drawings again. The game is revised to follow the Traffic Code activated May 1st 1977.&#10;&#10;5th edition (1990s): New publisher and new name. A modernized design, but still with the original idea.

Players take turns quickly adding more fuse cards to a continuously growing fuse until someone lets the bomb explode by playing one of his bomb cards, thereby earning him all of the fuse cards in play. He takes these cards, leaving only the starting match in play, then the fuse is lit once again.&#10;&#10;Each fuse card has a value, and playing the bomb cards too early doesn't bring many points; that said, waiting too long to score lets others play their defuse cards &mdash; which cuts the fuse back to the match and removes those fuse cards from the game &mdash; or jump in with a bomb card of their own (which nets them any defuse cards played since the previous bomb). You might want to hold on to high-valued fuse cards rather than let others snatch them up, but the game ends when all bombs have been played or the time bomb (inserted in the deck at the start of play) goes off. When that happens, everyone tallies their cards, then loses points for all the fuses in hand. Whichever bomb thrower has the highest score wins!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Dragon Raiders is a game where players take on the role of the Dragon, raiding the fantasy kingdom for food (to grow bigger and stronger) and treasures (to gain an advantage over the other Dragons).&#10;&#10;Game-play consists of a series of Raid phases, broken up into turns by an Accounting phase (where certain play elements get reset). Each Raid phase consists of three sub-phases; movement, reactive board elements, and combat, in that order. Players accomplish each sub-phase in an order determined by their power ranking. Players choose where to move based on what they think they can successfully raid, or may choose to go on adventures in the deepest forest. After the Dragons move, Knights will come out of their keeps to fight any Dragon nearby (i.e., adjacent to the keep).&#10;&#10;Combat consists of rolling 1d6 and adding your Power attribute; you must beat the Defense score of the board element in order to win. A Dragon who does not win his combat must retreat, losing half of his carried treasure as he does so. Dragons must fight other Dragons in the same space first; both roll 1d6 and add their Power, highest total wins. The loser gives half of his treasure to the winner and retreats. Ties result in both dragons retreating without losing any treasure.&#10;&#10;The end-game is triggered when a Dragon defeats the King, who sits in his castle at the center of the kingdom. The current Raid phase is finished out, and victory points are totaled. The highest total is considered the strongest Dragon and wins the game!&#10;&#10;",

The competing Daimyos direct their Samurai through the palace following some simple rules and quickly see that they can use the Samurai of the other Daimyos for their purposes. An exciting interwoven competition - with unexpected surpises.&#10;&#10;Takamatsu is a game of conflict and cooperation, with players trying to place (or not place!) their samurai in their own rooms. The palace consists of two circular paths that merge at one point, then separate once again. Players have 5-7 samurai that are split between two color-coded rooms at the start of the game, and a row of scoring cards &mdash; some face-down &mdash; are laid out next to the board.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you choose a room that contains at least one of your samurai, then you move some number of samurai in this room clockwise from this space. If the room contains only one samurai, you can move it one space; if it contains two, you can move both two spaces or only one a single space &mdash; but if an opposing samurai is with you, then you must move both exactly two spaces. When a room has three or more samurai, he must leave at least one behind (while still needing to bring at least one opposing samurai along, if any). When a samurai ends movement in a room of the same color, that samurai's daimyo collects the topmost scoring card, with multiple scorings being possible on a turn. For each open scoring card collected, the player immediately adjusts his scoring marker &mdash; which could move you back on the track, so sometimes you want to escort another samurai to his pad instead of bringing him to your place.&#10;&#10;When one player reaches twenty points, players finish the round, then tally their hidden scoring cards, if any. The player with the most points wins! (With two players, each daimyo controls two colors of samurai and must move an opposing samurai when possible. After one pagoda reaches the twenty point threshold, the players sum their two scores to determine a winner.)&#10;&#10;",

A *take* is the act of removing some number of dice from the edges of the pyramid and scoring them according to their original orientation in the structure.&#10;&#10;A player may take a group of dice from the pyramid according to certain scoring sets: runs, 3 of a kind, 4 of a kind, additive (numbers add to a sum), multiplicative (numbers multiply to a product), and others.  There are also takes that incur penalties, but that might be useful for setting up larger scoring sets.&#10;&#10;The players will continue to take dice from the pyramid until either they both take negative scores on successive turns or all of the dice are removed from the pyramid. The player with the highest score at the end is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The Good, The Bad &amp; The Funny is an Apples-style party card game for a bunch of people. Players make compound words or phrases from a set of word cards to satisfy a mission. The dealer decides which of the submissions is Good, which is Bad, and which is Funny, and rewards the players appropriately (3, -2 and 5 points respectively). The first to 21 (or -10) wins.&#10;&#10;There are three main differences between The Good, The Bad &amp; The Funny and other Apples-style games:&#10;&#10;The three main differences are:&#10;&#10;1. Scoring. Apples games with strangers can be aggravating - will they choose the funny card or the clever one? Or the realistic one? Or just choose something terrible.&#10;&#10;The dealer always has to choose The Good, The Bad &amp; The Funny.&#10;&#10;The Good is the best representation of the mission card. It&rsquo;s worth three points because, while good, it&rsquo;s boring and obvious. And you probably had the perfect card, so whatever.&#10;&#10;The Bad is the worst submission that round. It&rsquo;s worth negative two because I&rsquo;m sick of players constantly ditching cards instead of actually thinking about a good answer. You&rsquo;ll also notice that many of the players that think they are funny will end up with a lot of bad answers.&#10;&#10;The Funny gets the biggest laugh. Subjective, of course, but it&rsquo;s worth five points for entertaining the room.&#10;&#10;The first to (or above) 21 points wins, unless there is a tie, in which case play continues as normal until a single player has the highest score.&#10;&#10;There&rsquo;s another small twist, which is that players can also win by scoring -10 points. This makes it a bit more fun to be chosen for that bad answer in round 1.&#10;&#10;2. Players always play two cards. This is a game about compound words and phrases. Our lives are surrounded by such combinations - you&rsquo;ll start to notice much more after reading this sentence. Creating compound words and phrases is a wonderful challenge - it forces players to think about the many ways that a word can be interpreted and manipulated by another word. And the essence of this game is a carefully created wordlist that is composed of the most commonly occurring bits from compound words and phrases in the English language, almost all of which are nouns.&#10;&#10;There are a couple of key benefits to this approach. Most answers are not reliant on a shared understanding of pop. Many other Apples games assume a certain level of 21st Century culture familiarity while the word cards from The Good, The Bad &amp; The Funny are timeless (the mission cards, however, do have a bit of pop-infusion). Answers won&rsquo;t get stale, as the likelihood of a one playing the same combination twice within a play session or many, many play sessions is infinitely low. Even playing the same word card won&rsquo;t have the same negative effect as in other games because it is about how two cards react together, not simply a funny reference. Even if the same two cards are played together, the order can be changed to dramatically alter the meaning.&#10;&#10;The game is very replayable without the need for many, many expansions.&#10;&#10;3. At any given time, three mission cards are face up. Dealers get to choose which mission they want to judge, which allows for another layer of strategy. Players can hold onto cards that match future possible missions (don&rsquo;t you hate throwing out the perfect card right before getting the matching mission?).&#10;&#10;",

Each player starts with a base token in hand for their faction along with three other tiles from the 58 included in the game.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player either places one tile from hand into the playing area (with each tile featuring four illustrated quadrants and possibly a special action symbol) or moves his already placed base tile to a new location. The action symbols allow you to rotate or swap tiles already in play.&#10;&#10;Once the final tile is drawn, players take one final turn, then tally the score of their most valuable section of orthogonally connected tiles. The base token is worth five points, regular characters worth one point, and bonus items worth three points. Each faction has arch-enemies scattered amongst the tiles &mdash; e.g., kraken for pirates &mdash; and each arch-enemy touching your faction costs you a point. Whoever has the most valuable faction wins!&#10;&#10;",

Although it is recognised that flintlocks were used before and after these dates. It was mainly during this period that the flintlock musket and its associated socket-bayonet was the standard arm of the line infantry.&#10;&#10;The system is designed to be used with any scale of figures. There is no formal figurescale, the unit sizes being dictated by the base sizes, which in turn are based on the frontages of the prototype units. An infantry battalion might be, for example, ten 25mm figures, twenty 15mm figures or fifty 5 mm figures.&#10;&#10;The system is expressly designed for use with large formation games and is unsuitable for actions involving less than brigade strengths. Note that throughout the rules the term &ldquo;formation&rdquo; is used to convey the sense of brigade groupings and higher, whereas the term &ldquo;unit&rdquo; is used of bodies of troops making up brigades.&#10;&#10;",

You don't control the team breaking in, you control the guards. Although 'control' isn't quite the word; you watch as your team follows their patrol routes, then - via a hand of cards - interject with that casual glance over the shoulder or decision to switch direction at a critical moment, to catch the intruders... off-guard.&#10;&#10;Facility is a solo game that plays out as a cross between a deckbuilder and an AI-driven miniatures game. The player controls the actions of his guards by buying and playing cards from his deck, while the intruders follow a simple set of rules to sneak up behind the player's guards, knife them in the back and drag their bodies out of sight.&#10;&#10;",

Adventurers must locate the lost pieces of an amulet and then make it to the magic portal that will allow them to escape. At the same time travelers must avoid the predations of &ldquo;The Beast&rdquo; a terrible creature who patrols the valley.&#10;&#10;Each turn players explore their surroundings, react to encounters, change the map of the valley and move &quot;The Beast&quot;&#10;&#10;The map is a grid of tiles with four fixed points - mountains, within it.  As part of their turn players get the opportunity to rotate or move one or more of the tiles of the map, changing the paths through the jungle.  Players also have a short trail of tiles immediately behind them that they have already visited. This moves with them and can change in length depending on the items they are carrying.  This path cannot be changed by other players.  However if &quot;The Beast&quot; picks up this trail it will follow it and may attack the unfortunate adventurer.&#10;&#10;Each time they enter a new tile players draw from an encounter deck.  This may produce a beneficial result but more often will reveal one of the jungle denizens poised to attach them.  Surviving an encounter may result in them getting treasure, including pieces of the amulet needed to escape the valley.&#10;&#10;Escape from the valley is via a portal that moves around the outside edge of the map each turn.  To escape players must move off the edge of the map onto this portal&#10;&#10;",

The game centers around story cards and each player attempting to figure out which of 3 options the active player picked.&#10;&#10;As players take turns reading story cards, and matching answers, players collect Fruit Cards until a single player has collected six different fruit and is declared the winner. Of course there are plenty of ways to make sure that your opponent doesn't have an easy time of that, and a group of cheesy bad guys want those Fruit Cards for themselves.&#10;&#10;Players take turns drawing a story card, and reading it aloud. This is where your &quot;Naughty or Nice&quot; decision comes into play - because YOU get to decide what fills in that blank. You also draw a Fruit Card, which will indicate whether the other players need to match the choice of the Story Card reader, or not match it. For instance if a Apple card had been drawn, the other players would need to decide which of the three &quot;blank&quot; options was NOT choosen. We do that with... Letter Cards! After you've read your Story Card aloud all players, including the Story Card reader, play one of their Letter Cards indicating which of the three Story Card options they're choosing this turn. Of course hidden throughout the Fruit Card deck are action cards, and pesky fruit thieves. These cards are resolved immediately.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;You are humanity's last hope.&#10;&#10;In XCOM: The Board Game, you and up to three friends assume the roles of the leaders of the elite, international organization known as XCOM. It is your job to defend humanity, quell the rising panic, and turn back the alien invasion.&#10;&#10;Where the world's militaries have failed to stand against the alien invaders, you must succeed. To do so, you must make strategic use of the resources available to you. You must launch Interceptors to shoot down alien UFOs, assign soldiers to key missions, research alien technology, and use that technology to defend your base &mdash; all while trying to keep the world from collapsing just long enough that you can coordinate one final mission to repel the invaders for good.&#10;&#10;One of the more notable aspects of XCOM: The Board Game is the way that it incorporates a free and innovative digital app into the core of its gameplay. This digital companion will be available both as a downloadable app and as an online tool.&#10;&#10;The app's primary function is to coordinate the escalating alien invasion, randomly selecting from one of five different invasion plans. Each invasion plan represents a general outline that the alien commanders will use to coordinate the arrival of new UFOs, plan strikes against your base, and respond to your successes or failures as it seeks to conquer Earth. The app manages all of these tasks and heightens the game's tension as it forces you to respond in real-time. Then, after you move quickly to coordinate your response, you engage the enemy in the untimed resolution phase and feed the results to the app. Based upon these results, the app launches the invasion's next strikes.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the app teaches you the rules, controls the information that your satellites provide you, and tracks the progress of your resistance efforts, even as it allows you to enjoy the game at any of three levels of difficulty: Easy, Normal, or Hard.&#10;&#10;The use of this app does more than simply streamline your play experience and track your turns in real-time; it also permits a uniquely dynamic turn structure. While the variety of game phases remains the same from round to round, the order in which you and your friends must play through them may change, as may the number of a given phase. As a result, while you'll want to know where UFOs appear before you deploy your Interceptors, the alien invaders may be able to disrupt your satellite intel and force you to deploy your Interceptors on patrol with limited or no knowledge of the UFOs current whereabouts. Similarly, you may be forced to think about the costs of resolving the world&rsquo;s crises before you know how many troops you&rsquo;ll need to commit to your base defense.&#10;&#10;The effect of the app is to immerse you deep into the dramatic tension at the core of XCOM: The Board Game, and it ensures that the game presents a challenging and cooperative (or solo) experience like no other. Just like the XCOM department heads that you represent, you'll need to keep cool heads in order to prevail.&#10;&#10;",

Each turn you take a card into your hand from the supply, then you either play a card and carry out its instructions, or pick up your discard pile to refill your hand. Each card also has a scoring condition on it, and to win you'll want to maximize those conditions.&#10;&#10;As in the grandfather game Eminent Domain, actions you take can be &quot;boosted&quot; by revealing other cards sharing the same icon. Colonize and attack planets, do research, and take advantage of politics to score the most influence by the end of the game!&#10;&#10;",

This is a full-fledged space empire game featuring exploration, expansion, exploitation of galactic resources AND space combat.  However, it eschews the extermination or elimination of weaker players by allowing the stronger ones to become their overlords, thus extending to them a measure of protection.&#10;&#10;The order of game play is on a round system where players do their empire production simultaneously in a production phase.  Then the players do two actions each, in turn order, in the action phase.  In their actions, players may engage their opponents by diplomacy, trade, and espionage as well as military ventures.  Or they may go off on their own to explore for rewarding encounters.&#10;&#10;The building of economic engines will not be enough to win.  There is a shifting economy and there are changes to game conditions with the passing of ages.  Players must be willing to abandon hard-won colonies in order to adapt to the changes.  The game can be customized in many ways, one being the duration of the game can be set to any number of rounds the players want.  Players can set limits on the aggression level of the game if they desire a more peaceful experience.  There is a four player introductory game designed to introduce players to the basics of the game.  In this &quot;intro&quot; game, the special alien abilities and technologies are not used, thus placing players on an equal footing.&#10;&#10;A variety of mechanisms are employed which are designed to quash the common complaints that tend to occur in multiplayer conflict games.&#10;&#10;There are several possible ways the game can end in addition to timing out on the last round.  Players are rewarded on a point system for their accomplishments such their as economy, technology, exploration, military, cultural and diplomatic achievements.  The highest score gains the win.&#10;&#10;",

These special Argentinian fleas have been trained in the arts of martial combat and acrobatics for your entertainment and edification!  Watch them perform amazing acts of aerialist acumen. See them fight and spar as the ancient gladiators of lore. Experience a singular event of epic and microscopic proportions. Flip Florey's Flying Flea-rina will amaze and astound you!&quot;&#10;&#10;In Flea-rina, the players compete with their fleas to perform amazing stunts while making glorious attacks against each other. Each turn, the players select a stunt with a movement path. They then roll dice trying to match the icons on the stunt. Completing the stunt reaps victory points by entertaining the crowd. If they fail to complete the stunt they may still move along the path up to the icons rolled and may collect resources off the board and/or attack the other fleas. Fighting fleas also entertain the the crowd, gaining victory points with gladiatorial skill.&#10;&#10;When the players have depleted all the resources on the board or when one flea has been defeated, the game is over and the player who has entertained the crowd the most wins.&#10;&#10;",

Another crew of pirates has landed on the island where you were stranded by your mutinous ex-crew. This new crew of pirates are here to bury their treasure; leaving their boat unmanned just off the coast. You could try to man the ship yourself but with no gold to spend, what's the point? Capture the treasure before it's buried and make it to the ship to sail the high seas with your newly claimed booty.&#10;&#10;In this game of exploration, players will use various resources coupled with dice rolling to battle the pirates and animals they will encounter as they move throughout the island. If players can manage their inventory and time, they might be able to get off the island alive.&#10;&#10;",

Afterwards the food token must be returned to your home base.  The aim is to block other players' paths and be quicker than the others to deliver food to the own base or just steal from other players.

Problematically, several captains often show up for the same adventure.  So how shall we figure out who gets what loot?  We&rsquo;ll gamble for it of course.  That&rsquo;s the pirate way!&#10;&#10;Captains Wager is a betting and hand management game which combines classic elements of poker with the kind of clever card play gamers expect from more modern card games.  It accommodates 2-5 players and plays for about 30 minutes.&#10;&#10;In each round of the game players receive a hand of 4 crew cards (with values from 1-20) which they play in an attempt to win encounters by committing the highest valued card.  The crew cards also have effects which give players the opportunity to take actions in addition to providing their value towards winning the encounter.  Players who judge their hands to be strong based on their values and/or abilities can bet on them in order to increase the reward for winning.  For players unsure of their hand, but who still want to play the abilities of their crew, they can take a loan token worth minus 2 and still stay in the hand.  Players who have less confidence in their crews may fold to avoid risking their own precious gold.&#10;&#10;By winning encounters players may claim treasures and items which give them special abilities and the gold necessary to win the game.  The airship pirate who has claimed the most gold at the end of the game receives the title of Pirate Admiral and declares victory over the competition.&#10;&#10;",

The Seeker attracted the company of the Mennink&auml;inen and Keiju, kindly though capricious forest spirits, while protecting those under his care from evil pursuits of the Ajatar.&#10;&#10;You are this Seeker, bound to the wood and the land.&#10;&#10;Beware though, the Forest of Wyr is large and its paths many. Its elder trees can confuse the unwary and cause them &#10;to lose their way.&#10;&#10;The Seeker in the Forest of Wyr is a solitaire game lasting about 20 minutes. It needs only the deck of game cards, no dice or eurocubes required.&#10;&#10;To Win:&#10;The goal of the game is to finish one of six Quests randomly chosen from the Quest Deck at the start of the game.&#10;&#10;Play:&#10;During each turn of the game you will choose one of the two bottommost row&rsquo;s Stage Cards - your Seeker&rsquo;s Path. Two of the goals (see next page) may make this choice for you. You must choose the card before you draw any cards to your hand.&#10;&#10;Each Stage Card on the Seeker&rsquo;s Path has a number in the upper left representing the Amount of Time you must take to overcome the card with the Abilities you have in your hand. The pointer icon next to the number shows whether you must have a total Abilities Number either great than or exactly one less than the Amount of Time needed.&#10;&#10;From the cards in your hand, discard cards to your Seeker Deck&rsquo;s discard pile, adding the Abilities Numbers in the upper left. of those you discard, to overcome the Stage Card you chose on the Seeker&rsquo;s Path. Be sure when discarding cards to keep their current orientation when placing them on the discard pile (i.e. the current Abilities Numbers should be oriented upward when placed face down on the discard pile.)&#10;&#10;The Magical Objects in your hand of cards can grant you special powers during your turn. You can play a Magical Object at any time during your turn. Discard them when you use their powers.&#10;&#10;If you are able to overcome the Stage Card it will either be removed from the game, temporarily grant you a temporary Abilities bonus or penalty, be set in a special pile, or be added to your discard pile depending on the card.&#10;&#10;End of the Game:&#10;When the Quest Card is drawn from the Stage Deck&rsquo;s draw pile, it is added to the Seeker&rsquo;s Path and play continues normally in its final phase.&#10;&#10;When the Quest Card reaches the bottommost row of the Seeker&rsquo;s Path (The Quest Card always has the highest Initiative Number when deciding what cards to move at the end of a turn) the game ends.&#10;&#10;2014 Solitaire Print and Play Contest Awards&#10;&#10;Best Artwork&#10;First Place&#10;&#10;Best Medium Sized Game&#10;Second Place&#10;&#10;Best Written Rules&#10;Second Place (Tied)&#10;&#10;Most Innovative Mechanic&#10;Second Place (Tied)&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The six sons of the Sultan have come to you, the foremost tea merchants in land, with a request:&#10;&#10;Provide us with the best exotic teas the world has to offer and we will reward you richly (we may even favor you with special privileges if you impress us), but only one of you can become Chief Tea Merchant of the Sultanate!&#10;&#10;Six Sons of the Sultan is a game for two players that takes about 15-20 minutes. Players will have 10 rounds to gain prestige by supplying different kinds of tea to the Sultan&rsquo;s sons. Each type of tea has different costs and prestige points associated with it as well as special actions that may help the players during the game.&#10;&#10;There is also a solitaire play option.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game uses only 9 cards, 3 dice and some eurocubes. It can be printed, however, as a single page game board&#10;&#10;Phase 1 - The Dice Roll&#10;The start player begins the round by rolling all 3 dice (Note: in consecutive rounds each player will only roll two dice, having had one die passed to them previously). Once the dice are rolled they are assigned as follows:&#10;&#10;One die is chosen as the Order Die, the die number corresponding to 1 of the 6 Tea Card numbers.&#10;&#10;One die is then chosen as the Wealth Die, and will increase a player&rsquo;s total wealth by the amount shown on the die.&#10;&#10;The final die is the Passing Die and is passed to the other player. This die is locked and may not be rolled during the next player&rsquo;s turn unless the player uses the White Tea card&rsquo;s special action.&#10;&#10;Phase 2 - The Tea Order&#10;The player may now place orders on the Tea Card that matches the Order Die&rsquo;s number, thus pleasing one of the Sultan&rsquo;s sons. A player may move their eurocube token up the card&rsquo;s track as many spaces as they are able to pay for (the bottom number denotes the price), moving their token on the Wealth card accordingly. If a player has (0) wealth they may not place an order this turn.&#10;&#10;Spaces on the track also have a Prestige Point value which is totalled up at the end of the game (the top number shown for the space).&#10;&#10;Certain marked spaces also allow the player to use the Special Action of that card. If a player can afford to move their token up a number of spaces, passing more than one Special Action space, only the final space landed on is counted. The space must be landed on to use the Special Action. The player does not have to use the Special Action if they do not want to.&#10;&#10;Phase 3 - Wealth Gained&#10;The player may now move their Wealth token the number of spaces as indicated on the Wealth Die.&#10;&#10;The player&rsquo;s turn is now over and the opposing player takes the remaining two dice and rolls them to begin their turn.&#10;&#10;Once both players have had a turn, the round is over, the round token is moved down one space on the Time Card and a new round begins.&#10;&#10;Game End&#10;Play continues for a total of 10 rounds. When the 10th round is finished, players add up their respective Prestige Points to determine who will be the Chief Tea Merchant of the Sultanate. If the game ends in a tie, the player with the most accrued wealth is the winner.&#10;&#10;&#10;Released in the September 2018 Board Game of the Month Club $10+ package.&#10;&#10;",

Game Of Winds you are Gods of Wind blowing on a Balloon in order to make it land safely or push it against an obstacle during its fall.&#10;Most of you are Friendly Winds, whose goal is to help the Balloon land safely; the others are Adverse Winds, whose goal is to hinder the Balloon during its fall, causing it to collide with an obstacle or to fall into the water.&#10;During each turn you make your secret play by choosing a card, then all players unveil it at the same time &ldquo;blowing on the balloon&rdquo; while it falls (i.e. moving it accordingly to the cards played while advancing a turn). &#10;If you are a Friendly Winds you will try to guess who your mates are and match your plays in order to hold the control of the fall. If you are an Adverse Winds you will try to hide and hit at the right moment, causing a spectacular crash. &#10;Most important, no matter how the games ends, there will always be the time for another challenge: the playing time is less than 20 minutes, the game is pocket-sized so you may play it almost everywhere, the random matching of players guarantees a good longevity, both as party game or evening filler.&#10;Despite its simple rules, the game is hard to master. Strategies have to take into account the possible actions of other players. Predicting what they will do is a key factor to win.&#10;&#10;",

Pasha&rsquo;s Bokhara covers the Basmachi uprising against Soviet rule around Bokhara - present day Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.&#10;&#10;Published in Paper Wars #86 (Summer 2017 issue); publisher Compass Games.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Dead Apocalypse is one of the first fully cooperative deckbuilding games of strategic survival, set during a present day zombie apocalypse. Staying alive is your only goal in this game, and you must work with your allies to search for human survivors, abandoned locations, and lifesaving equipment to fend off the zombie horde.  Teamwork is the key to victory, for if you can't trust your fellow players none of you will reach the CDC... alive!&#10;&#10;Dead Apocalypse is a fully cooperative deckbuilding game, meaning all players strive for the same goal and either win together or lose together. Players will begin the game with the same starting decks consisting of a handful of survivors, a base camp location and some equipment. Players will take turns playing their hand to gain damage, occupy locations, use abilities and cure infections. Gaining damage allows the player to defeat ghastly Zombies who are protecting invaluable equipment, or surrounding a location, or even trapping other survivors. Once a Zombie is defeated, add the resources to your personal deck to be used for another turn. Though don't think Zombies will go down without a fight. The Zombie stack of cards holds surprise attack events which will force a player to have to defeat Zombies that match the type of event. If a player does not have the sufficient resources to defeat all Zombies, other players have the opportunity to assist in combat to help even the odds!&#10;&#10;Dead Apocalypse is  1-4 players so if there isn't someone in your company you still have the opportunity to try to fight for survival all alone. Don't fret though because there are other game variants for those seeking an easier game or a more competitive game.&#10;&#10;",

These include seven different color cards - Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, and Violet - that may be played sequentially to form a player's rainbow or to take an action that will help them manage their cards, get new cards, or attack another player. There are also two special cards: Pot O' Gold acts as a Wild Card as well as the winning card; Leprechauns are tricksters who undo the last action played.&#10;&#10;On their turns, players may play in one (or both) of two ways: to add to or to solidify their rainbow in front of them, or as an action. Hand order matters, and players must play the first card from their hand every turn; they may choose to play the second if possible. Play continues until one player has played all colors of the rainbow in order and plays a Pot O' Gold to win the game.&#10;&#10;",

Each turn, players will harvest genetic material: the currency with which they may buy mutations to change their species or propagate to increase their presence in the ecosystem. Players must balance strategy, tactics, and guile to compete in the pursuit of several unique win conditions; ultimately to ensure the survival of their genetic footprint.&#10;&#10;-- Developer's description&#10;&#10;Things Change.&#10;You are a species. That's not an insult, it's the premise of [the] game. In this game, you take on the role of a unique species in a rainforest ecosystem. Your goal is to out-compete your opponents to obtain the largest ecological footprint; and I have given you several win conditions so that you can prove it.&#10;&#10;The core mechanic of the game is called harvesting. Each turn, you will harvest genetic material (The game's currency) which you can use to buy mutations to make your creatures better equipped to compete, or propagate to increase your presence in the forest. The amount of genes you harvest depends on your presence and position in the forest. The more you have, the more genetic capital you have to work with. Neat, huh?&#10;&#10;Win Conditions.&#10;If you want to win the game, you'll need to be the first to achieve any one of these win conditions:&#10;&#10;Survival of the Fittest. This one is straightforward. If your creatures are the only ones alive in the forest, you win. Do this by clashing with opponents' creatures.&#10;&#10;Top of the Food Chain. If, at the beginning of your turn, you control three carnivores, you win. Easy, right? Go ahead, make that third carnivore. See what your opponents do.&#10;&#10;Ecological Niche. If, at the beginning of your turn, you control a creature in each Floor tile (Blue-green), you win. Who says barnacles can't be winners? Seriously, who says that?&#10;&#10;Okay, I think that's it. The game is designed for 2-3 players, but if you have a fourth, you should play in teams. Oh, and one more thing:&#10;&#10;It's time to get squishy.&#10;&#10;-- from the game manual&#10;&#10;",

The objective of the game is not necessarily to make the most money &ndash; although it helps &ndash; but to get the most satisfaction out of your career as a publisher by releasing the kind of games that you love.&#10;Over the course of a game players will seek funding and take out loans in order to license games from designers, hire artists and sell their games; boring parts of the process such as dealing with printers, shipping, warehousing and losing your house are abstracted away, but release deadlines are not!&#10;&#10;Each game design a player licenses (a Contract) is placed onto that player&rsquo;s production schedule &ndash; the player must then source enough artwork to make that game before it hits its release date, as games which cannot be released on time get bad buzz and won&rsquo;t make them so much money. There are a limited number of artists working on board game art, however, so competition for art in particular styles can be fierce, and players will have to outbid their rivals to include it in their games.&#10;&#10;In a game turn, players take turns to place their company's workers (discs) on the action spaces around the board. Some spaces function as traditional worker-placement action spaces and can be occupied only by a single disc at once. Other spaces - such as the artists or the game-design contract spaces - act as auctions; players place their discs on top of the stack of other discs already on the space, and once all discs have been placed, the players take turns from the top down to pay money equal to the number of discs in the stack if they want to commission art from that artist, or contract a game design from the submission queue. Players who place late pay the highest price but get first choice; players who place early could get a bargain, but only if nobody else outbids them for the thing they wanted.&#10;&#10;At the end of each turn, each player's catalogue of completed games sell to distributors and give him some income, but only a small number of games can be kept in print at any one time, and if a player's company has too much money in the bank the directors take the excess in dividends and blow it all on a weekend in Vegas.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, players score each contract they've completed, getting bonus points if it aligns with their company's goals.&#10;&#10;",

The group decides on a story by consensus, then builds characters. Players play cards on themselves with the positive side up to represent resources they have within the context of the story; they play cards negative side up on other players as problems.&#10;&#10;Players take turns telling tales about how they will use their resources and the story itself to overcome their problems. Other players select number cards from their hands to represent the plausibility of the active storyteller's chance of success. The player who selects the median number is rewarded with a bonus resource and the median number becomes the chance of success for the storyteller. If the turn of a card is below this chance of success, the problem is turned into a resource.&#10;&#10;After all players have had two turns to tackle their problems, the player with the most resources frames the climax. Players wager their resources on the final turn of the card.&#10;&#10;",

The game can be won in 3 ways:-&#10;&#10;    the business that delivers orders the quickest&#10;    the business with the greatest profit&#10;    the business with the lowest carbon footprint&#10;&#10;&#10;Players must make the same decisions businesses make every day.  How do I deliver? Will I make a profit? How should I grow? How can I cut my carbon footprint?&#10;&#10;Each turn a player must choose between taking an Air/Sea turn or a Rail/Road turn. You can only do one or the other. Playing your turn then requires 4 same steps in strict order:-&#10;&#10;    Step 1 - Deciding whether to buy new assets- planes, ships, trains &amp; trucks&#10;    Step 2 - Paying operational costs&#10;    Step 3 - Picking up an Air/Sea or Rail/Road card&#10;    Step 4 - The last thing you do in your turn is roll the dice to make deliveries. Income is earned by completing deliveries for the amount shown on your Order cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;These 4 easy-to-follow steps are summarised on an A6 card.&#10;Business on the Move  is extremely versatile and can be played at seven different levels, changing how to play and how to win.&#10;Extensive trials across the UK have seen the game played by nearly 600 young people aged 9-19, teachers and business professionals.&#10;&#10;",

You assemble your fleet and engage the enemy. Using the game&rsquo;s unique maneuver tool, you steer your capital ships across the battlefield, even while squadrons of starfighters buzz around them. Then, as these ships exchange fire, it&rsquo;s your job to issue the tactical commands that will decide the course of battle and, perhaps, the fate of the galaxy.&#10;&#10;Maneuver Tool&#10;The maneuver tool is one of the game&rsquo;s most innovative features and adds a unique feel to the way your capital ships must accommodate for inertia as they maneuver through the stars.&#10;&#10;It consists of a number of segments linked with hinges, which is used to plot the ship's course. More nimble ships are allowed to turn the ship further at each hinge.&#10;&#10;Command Stack&#10;Armada balances the awesome scale of the Star Wars galaxy&rsquo;s ships and space warfare with intuitive ship designs and accessible rules for issuing commands and resolving combat that make for rich, engaging, and highly tactical play experiences.&#10;&#10;Capital ships are extremely powerful war machines, but they&rsquo;re also massive and sophisticated vessels that can&rsquo;t swiftly react to every development in the heat of battle. Accordingly, the key to flying these vessels effectively is learning how to plan ahead. You want to issue your commands in such a way that your crews will be ready to execute them at just the right times.&#10;&#10;Each of your pre-painted capital ships has a command value, which determines how many commands it will have in its stack at any given point in time. During setup, you secretly build your initial command stack, selecting from any of four different commands, each of which provides a different advantage. Once you have locked your selections, you place the commands in your stack in the order of your choice. Then, during each round of game play, you secretly select and assign a new command to your ship, placing it at the bottom of your command stack, before you reveal the command at the top of your stack and gain its benefits.&#10;&#10;",

Will they try to come to your aid, leave you to fend for yourself, or outright stab you in the back? Every player must choose what will best help them survive.&#10;&#10;Game play happens in phases. In the first phase of each round, the players (in turn order) roll their dice and attempt to get the best score possible. A given die may be rerolled any number of times until a) the player accepts the number on the die or b) the die rolls a 1. If the die rolls a one, that die is locked at one for the round.&#10;&#10;Once each player has their starting roll for the round, the scheming begins. Each player must choose to help or hinder an opponent with five possible outcomes (3 outcomes if there are only two players left).&#10;&#10;Outcome 1 - Player A helps Player B: Player B adds 3 points to their score for the round.&#10;Outcome 2 - Player A hinders Player B: Player B subtracts 3 points.&#10;Outcome 3 - Player A helps Player B and Player B helps Player A: Each player adds 6 points.&#10;Outcome 4 - Player A hinders Player B and Player B hinders Player A: Each player subtracts 6 points.&#10;Outcome 5 - Player A helps Player B and Player B hinders Player A: Player A subtracts 6 Points and Player B adds 6 points.&#10;&#10;At the end of the second phase, the player with the lowest score in the round loses a die. Players gain bonus chips adding 1 point to their score for the next round for each player with a higher score in the current round. The player with the highest score goes first next round.&#10;&#10;The game ends when only one player is left with dice. All others have been eaten by the zombie.&#10;&#10;",

Each character uses playing cards for a pontoon/blackjack mini game, drawing cards as close to 21 as possible to increase the selection of special actions that are available for use.  Bust hands only allow the most basic attacks, but increase the character's defensive abilities.  Attacks are resolved with opposed dice rolls and players alternate activation of their characters, so the players are continuously engaged in the game.&#10;&#10;Infamy: Welcome to The Big Smoke has a range of intricately detailed, resin-cast, 32mm scale miniatures. Many Infamy: Welcome to The Big Smoke characters are based on famous individuals from literature and history, but given a steampunk twist.&#10;&#10;It is set in an alternate Victorian London in turmoil through the development of advanced new technology. The city is packed with intriguing stories, fascinating characters and a deep history, making for a rich steampunk setting. Character cards describe the unique abilities of each character, creating games that have an exciting cinematic style.&#10;&#10;",

This is not a simplified, beginner version of Dungeons and Dragons.

It is about Grabbing a backpack, a sandwich, that monster you call a &ldquo;sibling,&rdquo; and heading out into the wilderness, leaving the comfort of home at your back.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "From the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 to the beginning of WWI in 1914, there was an amazing development of bigger, faster, and more modern steamships. Whereas in 1870 there are still many clippers around and the good old paddle steamer &quot;Scotia&quot; sails the North Atlantic, sea trade is dominated by the end of this era by huge vessels like &quot;Mauretania&quot;(Cunard), &quot;Olympic&quot;(White Star), or &quot;Imperator&quot;(Hapag).&#10;&#10;In Transatlantic, 2 to 4 players lead their own shipping companies, which transport freight, mail, and passengers around the globe. They purchase new steamships from the market, each of them historical with their individual technical data (tons, knots etc.). Competition is tough, especially in the North Atlantic where winning the &quot;Blue Riband&quot; is not only a matter of prestige, but may also be a profitable investment. In order to let a shipping company flourish, purchasing the best steamships is not enough, if one fails to acquire enough coal bunkers and trade posts as well.&#10;&#10;The game is driven by cards; on each turn, play one card and execute the related action. As new cards enter the game, build your individual deck of cards with new or improved possibilities. The task is to manage your merchant fleet most efficiently. It's a maritime strategy game with low luck, lots of interactive choices, and tough decisions.&#10;&#10;",

With many strategies at their disposal, players optimize four actions per turn in attempt to score the most victory points over five epochs.&#10;&#10;Each player controls several medieval characters that roam the countryside tending farms, taxing towns and taking outposts in effort to rise in power.&#10;&#10;But that&rsquo;s only the tip of the behemoth's horn! You will also compete to acquire coveted feudums, which increase your membership status in one of six guilds. But beware! Feudum owners must pay homage to the king through military service or face the charge of disloyalty.&#10;&#10;Once a guild member, you will dutifully play your part in a progressive economic cycle, whereby the farmer ships goods to the merchant who equips the alchemist, who invents black powder, which arms the knight, and so on.&#10;&#10;If you run your guilds wisely, maintain control of key locations and adapt best to changing events, you will be victorious. Unless, of course, you starve, get sidetracked by sea serpents or develop an unhealthy interest in fermented grapes. Long live the King!&#10;&#10;",

In the game, the players seek to make the most money by buying and selling stock certificates of up to fifteen railroad companies. The player with the most stock of a particular company in his possession acts as the president of this company and is responsible for track laying, the placement of railheads (which are necessary for train runs), route selection and train acquisition. Running trains earns money and this money is either divided by the shareholders or kept in the company's treasure for further investments (like buying better trains or constructing track). This decision influences the value of the company's shares &mdash; and not the player with the most stock or the most beautiful constructed track wins the game, but the player with the most riches in terms of cash and shares.&#10;&#10;18CZ is unique as it uses three different corporation sizes, five small companies with 50%-25%-25% shares, five medium companies with 40%-20%-20%-20% shares, and five big companies with the usual 20%-10%-10%-10%-10%-10%-10%-10%-10% share distribution. Each company size has a different set of trains, and the key focus in this game is that bigger companies can absorb smaller companies.&#10;&#10;",

The core mechanic of the game has players make a single move each turn which they can build into a chain of movement allowing you to move your fleet across the battlefield. Players will also gain access to dynamic powers through flux cards, allowing them to use their fallen warriors to fuel more powerful attacks. Players will gain victory by showing they&rsquo;re the most powerful set of hedrons in the whole sector through dominating areas of space and destroying your opponent&rsquo;s hedrons.&#10;&#10;Throughout gameplay, players are faced with balancing their current options and opportunities with the need to gain resources and maintain a strong board presence. Is it better to use this hedron as a warrior on the board, or better to keep it for dynamic attacks? At the end of the game, players will add their total energy on the board to their points total to determine the final victor.&#10;&#10;",

Combining elements of co-operative play and secret rogue players with unbelievably immersive gameplay, This House is Haunted is a truly original experience.&#10;&#10;What's the story? Well, it appears your house is haunted by demonic spirits! Will you banish the evil presence or become possessed yourself? Bust out the flashlights, explore your darkened home, avoid terrible curses, survive haunted rooms, all the while not know which of your friends you can actually trust...&#10;&#10;Each turn players begin in the designated Home Room where the current leader decides what rooms in the haunted house players will go to in order to draw cards. There are 6 different types of cards that can be drawn. Seals, Blessings, Curses, Demon Marks, Hexes, and Haunting Cards. Haunting Cards trap players in rooms, where they must follow the card's instructions and terrorize visiting players. Our brave human players are attempting to retrieve enough Seal Cards and get them back to the Home Room, but if they draw too many demon Mark Cards they can become possessed and secretly change to the demon's team.&#10;&#10;",

Each player has five wooden figures, and if you're the first to place all five of your figures on the board, you win!&#10;&#10;Ga&iuml;a includes two levels of rules, with the basic rules allowing for play with those as young as eight thanks to the game's simple mechanisms and non-attacking nature. The advanced rules give you the opportunity to use godly powers &mdash; lightning, volcanoes, rain, sun, earthquakes, etc. &mdash; to shape the world after it has been created. You can even steal an opponent's cities, making it a more aggressive game with a higher level of strategy.&#10;&#10;",

The game master draws and reveals 3 number cards from the deck, then each player records them in order. After that, players can check 3 or more numbers which are same or continuous in a row horizontally, or vertically, and gain some points according to the quantity of the numbers he/she checked. The player checked numbers take a bonus number, then gets a chance of additional check. When a player checks fixed times, he/she gain some special ability which would be useful for the game. The game ends when every player couldn't record the numbers, then the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Although the cakes belong to specific players, the players may freely use each others' ingredients and parts to bake them. All players participating in a cake will score but only when it is completed and only if the cake wins the final contest.&#10;&#10;Bake the Cake! is not about baking your own cake first but rather contribute most to the winning cake. To stop other players, you may take the ingredients they want, use the kitchen tools they need and even eat their ingredients (but not too many or you will get a stomache ache).&#10;&#10;The gameplay is quick and intensive as the players fight to get hold of the ingredients and the tools, not unlike what it would be in a real kitchen with too many bakers. Behind the playful theme hides a tactical game where each player must play her cards well to spread her colors to all cakes and at the same get as many other players to them as possible. Please don't try the game recipes at home and don't eat the winning cake!&#10;&#10;Game meachanisms include:&#10;&#10;Economy: The players use ingredients and tools to accomplish their objective. &#10;Interdependence: The players compete about the same resources but may also earn points for each other. &#10;Take that: Players may interfere each other by blocking tools or eating ingredients. &#10;Balanced victory condition: To win, a player must ensure that other players score as well.&#10;&#10;",

Well, on the five peninsulas of Grog Island, they can invest their loot in rock-solid businesses, such as peg-leg shops, carpentries for figureheads, workshops for voodoo dolls, or the infamous &quot;Grog Hole&quot; pub.&#10;&#10;The core of Grog Island is its unique auction mechanism, which uses five colored dice. The players use these dice and the pips on them to create and raise bids. While the winner of an auction can claim buildings on certain peninsulas, the players who have passed are also rewarded: Not only do they receive goods like grog bottles or treasure maps but they also visit merchant ships where they can trade these goods for money, parrots or treasure chests. The auction mechanism of Grog Island makes for tactical and interesting gameplay as in certain moments, passing can be almost as rewarding as winning an auction. Finding the right balance between bidding and backing out is the key to winning.&#10;&#10;The game ends as soon as one player has claimed a certain number of buildings, then all players score the secret goal cards they received both at the start of and during the game. These cards may give points for majorities on peninsulas as well as for claiming certain types of buildings or collecting certain goods. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Shelter combines that strategic gameplay of card-duelling games with a simple dice roll based enemy to create a unique single-player experience.&#10;&#10;Based on the hugely popular Android, iOS and Windows Phone game, Shelter will provide you with hours of exciting play.&#10;&#10;From the developer's website:&#10;&#10;Shelter is a single player game where you build a deck of duelling cards and take them into battle against a zombie deck that &ldquo;plays itself&rdquo;. The zombie deck is not controlled by a hideously complex AI, but plays based on a simple set of rules and dice rolls for that element of chance. You must fight off the waves of zombies before they smash your shelter&rsquo;s barricades and start munching on your brains.&#10;&#10;You choose your survival strategy when you build your deck. Do you pack as many guns into your deck as you can? Do you use traps and reinforce your defences? Do you stun stronger zombies and pick off the weak ones? You have the freedom to play as you want.&#10;&#10;As you win duels, you will be rewarded with new cards to work into your deck and streamline your play style.&#10;&#10;",

An unknown member of the team has been infected by an alien entity and will sabotage and infect the researchers as they try and build a satellite array to contact mission control. Will you survive? Are your friends infected by an alien entity? Can you contact mission control before its too late? Grab some friends and join the paranoia.&#10;&#10;Alien Entity is meant to be played multiple times. Players are passed cards face down to determine who is playing as a human or an alien. The humans win if the satellite array is built or the alien gets shot. The alien wins if it passes out infection cards to all of the humans. After each game ends, points are calculated and another game starts with a new random person as the Alien.&#10;&#10;Each player draws cards from a central pile and takes turns playing and passing cards. Choose wisely because you will only be able to play one card per turn and equipment such as body armor only lasts until your next turn.You may pass cards face down to other players to either help them or hurt their progress. If you are a human you may want to pass parts of the satellite array to another human. If you are an alien you can pass infection cards to other players to get them on your side.&#10;&#10;Games usually last between five and ten minutes. After each game points are given depending on the outcome of the game. The cards are then re-shuffled and a new alien player is secretly chosen. You can play until a player amasses 7 points or you can just play for fun indefinitely.&#10;&#10;",

Will you focus your limited time &amp; efforts on hacking the other teams? Or will you try to mount an impregnable firewall? Don&rsquo;t forget to keep your servers online &amp; healthy to generate the most points out of them!&#10;&#10;Gameplay Overview:&#10;    The game consists of 3 rounds, and each player can take up to 5 actions each round. Players have a set of action tiles to simultaneous choose &amp; resolve actions in the following order: &#10;    1. Install - Pay cards to buy Servers Cards to generate VP when the round ends.&#10;    2. Defense - Play Defense Cards to fend attacks and gain card effects.&#10;    3. Attack - Play Attack Cards to hack other player's servers and score VP immediately. &#10;    4. Mitigation - Pay cards to repair damage dealt your servers.&#10;    At the end of the round, players score VP depending on the health of their servers. Then they remove all damage tokens from their servers, discard their hand and draw 8 new cards for the next round. &#10;    Player with most VP at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

The objective of the game is to create a continuous connection with one set of blocks that spans the length of the game board.&#10;&#10;The game board is a modular square; prior to the game players place &quot;terrain&quot; upon the board using neutral blocks. Each player then must decide how to bridge and/or tunnel through pieces to reach the other side. Once per turn, a player may either place a new piece into play or move one of their existing pieces on the board, as long as it isn't trapped by an opponent's piece. Alternatively, players can use a small selection of &quot;wildcard&quot; pieces that provide a connection for all the players.&#10;&#10;A game is won once the first person successfully bridges the board with no edge connections between pieces.&#10;&#10;Multiple rule variants possible - this is a family of games about building geometric connections in 3d space.&#10;&#10;",

Each card belongs to one of the eight Olympians gods (a family), and shows a level (1 to 3).&#10;&#10;During the five turns of the game, players will try to transfer their cards to the Elysium and write their own Legends, which are series of cards from the same family or from different families of the same level. The more epic the Legends, the more favor from the gods they&rsquo;ll earn. But as they go to Elysium, most cards lose their power and players will therefore have to renounce some of their combinations !&#10;&#10;A game of balance and opportunity with  simple action, but constant dilemmas and complex strategies.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In Find the Treasure!, the players take on the roles of pirates searching a secret treasure. There are nine possible places on the island but each map only shows what is hidden along a specific longitude or latitude. To dig randomly is risky as each place may contain unknown dangers. Instead, the players must challenge each other for the maps or watch where the others dig and then steal whatever they find. To win Find the Treasure!, you must find out the other players' clues while guarding your own, lure them into digging where there are no diamonds and escape from the island before they realize that you have the treasure.&#10;&#10;The gameplay is tense and interactive as the players struggle to seek through the island with one eye and watching the other players' hunt with the other. As more and more of the island's secrets are dug up, the pirates will close in on each other, some eager to fight, others to escape, and tactics and deduction rather than brute force will be decisive. May the most ruthless pirat win!&#10;&#10;Game mechanisms include:&#10;&#10;1. Changing and hidden game board: The island is different in each game and the location of the treasure hidden to the players. &#10;2. Player balance: The players have similar resources (1 pirate and 1 ship) and are always equally strong. &#10;3. Deduction: By acquiring maps, the players can deduce where the treasure is located. &#10;4. Hidden score: The players do not know what the others have found.&#10;&#10;",

Depending on how much luck you want to introduce in the game, it is spun fast or slow.&#10;&#10;When a player believes that the colour of a card he wants to gain is under his mouth, he pushes the head of the crocodile down, stopping the spinner. Now is checked, what the each player, not only the one who stopped the disc, touches with his alligator mouth.&#10;&#10;If a crocodile touches a colour from the available cards, that player takes all those cards. If the crocodile touches nothing or a colour that is unavailable, he gains nothing.&#10;&#10;Then, the cards are replenished, the crocodiles are placed back in their starting positions, and a new round begins.&#10;&#10;Original German description:&#10;&#10;Im Sumpf lauern die hungrigen Krokodile auf fette Beute. V&ouml;llig reglos beobachten sie ihre Umgebung und warten darauf, dass etwas K&ouml;stliches an ihrer Nase vorbei schwimmt. Ist der richtige Moment gekommen, schnappen sie schnell zu! Doch nicht alles, was mit einem Happs zwischen ihren Z&auml;hnen landet, ist auch wirklich ein Leckerbissen. Wer es schafft, gezielt zuzubei&szlig;en und am Ende die meisten H&auml;ppchen hat, gewinnt das Spiel.&#10;&#10;Die Karten zeigen entweder ein, zwei oder drei Tiere oder einen Wecker. Das alles gibt es in den vier Farben, die auch auf dem Spielplan zu finden sind. Die Spieler schauen sich die drei Karten an, damit sie wissen, wo sie den Kreisel am besten stoppen m&uuml;ssen, um Punkte zu bekommen. Dann wird der Kreisel gedreht. Je nachdem, wieviel Zufall man im Spiel haben m&ouml;chte, dreht man den Kreisel schnell oder langsam. Wenn ein Spieler glaubt, dass die Farbe einer Karte, die er haben m&ouml;chte unter seinem Maul ist, dr&uuml;ckt er den Kopf des Krokodils schnell nach unten und stoppt so die Strudelscheibe. Jetzt wird &uuml;berpr&uuml;ft, was die einzelnen Spieler, nicht nur der, der die Scheibe angehalten hat, mit seinem Krokodilmaul ber&uuml;hrt. Ber&uuml;hrt ein Krokodilmaul eine Farbe, von der auch Karten offen ausliegen, so nimmt der Spieler alle davon an sich. Zeigt sein Maul auf eine Farbe, zu der es keine Karte gibt, oder ins Leere, so bekommt er eben in dieser Runde nichts. Die Karten werden dann wieder auf drei offene Karten aufgef&uuml;llt, die Krokodile wieder in die Ausgangsstellung gekippt und die n&auml;chste Runde beginnt.&#10;&#10;",

Players add to the common star, tiles which represent various planets or moons (that protect planets or help create life). Each of these tiles/planets give a different number of tokens (water, atmosphere, asteroids and light) and each planet has their climatic condition, which allows us to create life on these planets. Players can also interact trying to interrupt opponents planets by using space effects, by space tales or fulfill goals to earn more points at the end of the universe.

The official rules are included with the Dishonored Tarot Deck which was included as a pre-order bonus of the video game in some regions.&#10;&#10;It is mostly co-operative in so much as it is a turn-based game in which players change teams from round to round based on which player bets they can win the most tricks with the card they have been dealt. The winner of the betting round, or the Taker, then plays against the other players to win as many elected tricks before the round's end. At the conclusion of a round, the Taker's ability to completed win the required tricks is scored and the inverse of the Taker's score is given to each of the remaining players. The player left of the previous round's Taker deals a new round and bidding begins once again.&#10;&#10;The Game of Nancy has no set winning end score and thus, duration is unknown. The rules state that a target score should be set, and agreed upon, prior to game commencement.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Sometimes when a family moves into a new house, it's not the best place to live. It does, however, turn out to be the best place to stay forever...&#10;&#10;Darkness Comes is a co-operative board game that tells a story of a family trying to escape from a haunted house. The game begins quickly. The set-up is gamified as the players use their cards to create the initial situation on the board. They decide which areas are haunted and which doors are closed, how much time they need to escape, where they can find useful items, what they should do before leaving the place. Every card they play increases the tension, and strange things start to happen: Menacing shadows gather, and family members' faces disappear from photographs. All these events prepare us for the forthcoming nightmare.&#10;&#10;Then the main phase of the game begins. The house tries to ensnare the characters inside or kill them. Trying to find their way out, the family members encounter many kinds of horrors. Every time it happens, they decide whether to strengthen the house, hurt themselves, or change their plans.&#10;&#10;Characters co-operate and support each other by transferring love points &mdash; but sometimes they have to risk their sanity to survive. And sometimes they lose their minds. That's why the rules of the game can change. The possessed character may decide to side with the sinister house. It comes as no surprise for horror fans when the father of the family gets mad and finds the axe!&#10;&#10;",

However, he knows that the brilliant detective, Sherlock Holmes, has caught on to his plans and is trying to sabotage them! Prepared for this possibility, he has hired all his henchmen through intermediaries and hidden himself among them. Who will be discovered first: Sherlock or Moriarty?&#10;&#10;Moriarty's Machinations is a party deduction game for 5-10 players. Each player starts with a unique role card, and which roles are in the game depends on how many players there are. Each role has different information about the other players.&#10;&#10;Phase 1: Information Exchange&#10;At the start of the game, a script is read to inform each player of their privileged knowledge about some of the other players.&#10;&#10;Phase 2: Heists&#10;Players take turns selecting crew members to go on Heists. If the majority of the table approves, then that crew goes on a Heist. Each crew member is given a set of Heist Cards. Cops can choose to Foil the Heist, and it only takes one cop to successfully do so. If no Cops Foil the Heist, then the points are awarded to the Robbers. Otherwise the Cops get the points.&#10;&#10;Phase 3: Accusation&#10;Once one team has reached the required point total, the Accusation phase begins. Jack the Ripper and Inspector Lestrade reveal their roles publicly and try to guess who the leader of the opposing team is. If they guess correctly, their team wins. If they tie, then the win is based on Heist points.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Christina Regina is a card game version of Christina Regina - the Board Game. It is a game about politics and intrigues in 17th century Sweden where each player represents a faction with a hidden agenda. The end of their intrigues is the newly appointed queen Christina of Sweden and their means include persuasion, agitation, manipulation and even assassination. They achieve this by carefully steering the queen towards influence of their own faction and away from influence of other factions. At the same time, they must closely monitor the other players' actions to guess their agendas. But beware, if your own agenda is too obvious, you may yourself become the victim of your opponents' intrigues!&#10; Game mechanisms include:&#10; 1. Card drawing: Cards are drawn or discarded so that each new player in turn is faced with new options. &#10;2. Asymmetric scoring: There are no &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; cards but they all score differently for different players. &#10;3. Hidden agendas: The players do not know how much the other players score until the very end. &#10;4. Guessing game: Based on how players play, the other players may gain points by guessing their agendas (or lose points by guessing wrong).&#10;&#10;Christina Regina is the third game in the Nova Suecia series.&#10;&#10;",

Resolving a crisis places it back in the dive deck, meaning it may resurface again.&#10;&#10;The deeper Nautilus and her crew travel, the greater the rewards but the greatest rewards are shared only with those demonstrating the most loyalty to the Captain.&#10;&#10;",

Players can also pick any scenario as a starting point and determine their own period of the conflict to simulate.&#10;&#10;On To Paris! is a fast moving competitive one map game where players do their best to control their forces and where every decision creates excitement and tension. The game system features interactive game play with flexible initiative and variable turn length as well as extensive defensive player reaction ability. The game puts players in charge of all the famous Corps and Army leaders of the Franco Prussian war which are all rated for their individual leadership qualities and occasional unique characteristics like resistance to following orders.&#10;&#10;",

However, a cat and a ratcatcher are looking to catch the rats. Each rat has a special ability that can help ensure victory. With a little luck and some skill, the rats will find what they need in town, all the while wearing dapper hats, of course!&#10;&#10;Players, as rats, collect Food cards to place in their buffets to complete Entrees given to them at the start of the game. To collect Food cards, players roll a die and move into different locations, such as a bakery or a butcher shop. There are five different types of food: Bread, Fruit, Meat, Vegetable, and Cheese. The different locations offer these types of Food. For example, when a rat enters the Cheese Shop, he or she draws a card from the Cheese deck. Or, when a rat enters the Pastry Shop, he or she draws a card from either the Bread deck OR the Fruit deck.&#10;&#10;Then, the rats add cards to their buffets from their hands, but only one at a time. After that, the player switches into the role of the cat and/or ratcatcher. He or she rolls the Enemy die and moves the cat and/or ratcatcher accordingly. When the cat enters the same tile as a rat, he or she must discard a card in hand. When the ratcatcher enters the same tile as a rat, he or she must lose a card from his or her buffet. So, players can use the cat and ratcatcher to keep other rats in check if a player is getting too far ahead.&#10;&#10;The game moves to a final turn when a player has ten Food cards in his or her buffet OR when any Food deck runs out of cards. Then, the player with the most points, when adding up all of his or her Entrees and Food cards, wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

In the game, the players play both knights and damosels from the Arthurian legend - each with his or her different objectives. As a knight, compete with the other knights to become the most noble of them all or cooperate in quests and battles to earn glory in the eyes of King Arthur. As a damosel, provide another knight with the arms and virtues he needs until he is wrapped around your finger. But beware, if the Land falls you will all fall with it!&#10;&#10;Game mechanisms include:&#10; 1. Double deck building: The players build decks in two ways, different types (knights) or similar colors (damosels)&#10;2. Hidden information: The damosel do not build their own deck but try to get cards of their (hidden) color to the same knight&#10;3. Card placement: The players place cards to earn points but may only place cards not already placed by another player&#10;4. Simultaneous actions: The success of an action depends on a player's ability to predict the card played of another player&#10;5. Cooperation: The players fight wars and obtain quests together.&#10;6. Prisoners' dilemma: One player may benefit by not cooperating but if all do so, all will lose.&#10;&#10;",

The game begins immediately following the Falaise Battle and continues through to 15 December, at which point Third Army was sent to fight In the Battle of the Bulge. Your goal as a player is to surpass Patton&rsquo;s original record, thereby possibly forestalling Germany&rsquo;s Ardennes Offensive and thereby gaining glory as a great general.&#10;&#10;In the game, you control US and other Allied units assigned to the Third Army. The game system plays the Germans. You will have to deal with a wide variety of situations, from battling against fierce panzer counterattacks, to figuring out ways to extend your lines of supply. Your objective: Germany!&#10;&#10;The game has two levels: the Standard Rules, which gives a quick wargame, and the Optional Rules, which give more realism for more complexity.&#10;&#10;While Patton&rsquo;s Third Army is a solitaire game, multiple players can play as the US team, making decisions by consensus, or each managing operations along one of the &ldquo;Axes of Advance&rdquo;. However, one player should always be the Commander of Third Army, and his decision is final!&#10;&#10;Patton's Third Army FAQ&#10;&#10;Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 228 counters&#10;&#10;Magazine: World at War #43&#10;&#10;",

Trump cards can win against other dynasty cards, but they give zero victory points. At the end of each round, players get points by gathering cards from different dynasties. Dynasties award different amounts of points depending on the round being played.&#10;&#10;There are also some special cards that give extra points or even others that allow different effects during play.&#10;&#10;Each card has a Bonus that can be triggered by the player initiating the trick, adding more strategy and density to the game.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The power of games to teach abstract concepts is more and more acknowledged. Find the Bug! offers an introduction to IT testing through a fast and simple board game.&#10;&#10;The application is simulated by a game board divided into a number of components. Each component has a unique number of bugs with a unique level of severity. The test leads take turn to analyse the application (to learn where bugs are likely to find) and to place testers in the application (to find those bugs). Each bug scores a value according to its severity level.&#10;&#10;Once a set of components is perceived to be bug free, a test lead may let a tester cover the entire set and thus increase the probability of finding bugs in the next round. However, if the test lead is wrong, the tester's effort is lost so don't be too fast!&#10;&#10;The winner is the one who finds most bugs.&#10;&#10;Find the Bug! is mainly designed for IT professionals who want to learn testing in a fun way. However, ordinary gamers may also enjoy this deductive challenge where you must use your limited resources efficiently and monitor the other player's actions carefully to Find the Bug!&#10;&#10;Game mechanisms include:&#10;&#10;1. Changing and hidden game board: The number, value and location of the bugs is different in each game and they are hidden to the players.&#10;2. Player balance: The players have the same amount of testers and are always equally strong.&#10;3. Predictable odds: To find a bug requires luck but the more pre-analysis a player does, the better are the odds for finding them.&#10;4. Open end: The potentially high end game score makes every game open until the very end.&#10;5. Educational: The game teaches IT testing in a game context&#10;&#10;",

Warriors who slay monsters, adventurers who grab loot, heroes who level up. Heck, halflings who stay at home eating pie all day. But the world of Munchkin is also sad and benighted, a place where those very same Munchkins are all too often backstabbed by buddies, dined on by dragons, and discovered by doom ducks. Heroes delve too deep, plummet down pits, and lose their loot &mdash; and that's before they die.&#10;&#10;Now what if you combined Gloom with Munchkin? Keith Baker of Atlas Games is doing just that! In Munchkin Gloom , players shepherd their parties through terrible travails and troublesome tribulations until &mdash; inevitably &mdash; they perish in pain. Naturally, the most miserable fellowship wins.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Carcassonne is a tile-placement game in which the players draw and place a tile with a piece of southern French landscape on it. The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, etcetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of his meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.&#10;&#10;During a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: &quot;Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?&quot; or &quot;Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, giving him a hard time to complete his project and score points?&quot; Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.&#10;&#10;This Big Box is the same size as other Big Boxes, but with a slightly different component mix. This big box includes the basic game, Inns &amp; Cathedrals, Traders &amp; Builders, Wheel of Fortune, Hills &amp; Sheep and The River. It also includes two extra sets of meeples - one pink and one purple.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Welcome to a galaxy of adventure!&#10;&#10;In the frozen heart of space lies a fantastic galaxy of planets populated by space-faring factions called Planeteers, who wage a never-ending battle of Rayguns and Rocketships. Some seek action like the brash Astro-Rangers, others desire riches like the fearsome Star Pirates. Some planeteers will to conquer like the horrible alien Blaarg or hunger for honor like the reptilian Zard. Which Planeteers will be the master of the galaxy? That's up to you!&#10;&#10;Rayguns and Rocketships is an action strategy game inspired by the sci-fi classics of the pulp era. The game features fast-paced strategy, pulse-pounding action and over 32 original miniatures!&#10;&#10;Players starts by selecting a Planeteer faction consisting of a rocketship miniature, a rocketship interior map, a crew of six Planeteers miniatures, a captain miniature, a two-sided captain card and a deck of maneuver cards unique to each Planeteer faction. Player place their crew on their rocketship map - in the cockpit, manning the control systems or manning a raygun -  each gives advantages in flight and combat.&#10;&#10;Play is divided into three phases: rocketship movement, rocketship combat, crew movement and combat. Players plot their Rocketship's course using maneuver cards or star cards which are added to the player's hand each turn to provide additional tactical and combat advantages during play.&#10;&#10;As the gigantic rocketships maneuver on the Star Map, they blast away at each other with their deadly rayguns. Crew members can leap out of the airlocks to jetpack into combat with other Planeteers or board enemy rocketships to engage in fierce hand-to-hand combat!&#10;&#10;Points are scored by defeating crew, playing star cards and destroying rayguns and rocketships. The player who reaches the game's victory point goal wins the game and is declared master of the galaxy!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Um Himmels Willen (For Heaven's Sake) is the game of the crazy cards. The rules are simple: Play a card, comply the task and score the points.  There are three kinds of tasks:&#10; *A trivia question: Ask the question to another player. If his answer is correct, both you and that player gain points.&#10; *A puzzle: Make a certain card combination to score points.&#10; *A dexterity challenge: Complete some action that requires balance or sleight of hand.&#10;&#10;Based on a unique concept, Um Himmels Willen garantees fun, tension and variety for gamers of all ages.&#10;&#10;Um Himmels Willen is very interactive and contains also a special variant for Teams.&#10;&#10;Original description (German): &#10;Tante Lise hat gerade ein Farbenpaar ausgespielt, Oma Frieda der kleinen Hanna eine Quizfrage gestellt und Papa Ferdi versucht 10 Karten auf seinem K&ouml;rper zu verteilen, w&auml;hrend er eine Spielkarte auf seinem Kopf balanciert.&#10;&#10;Um Himmels Willen ist das Spiel der verr&uuml;ckten Karten. Denkbar einfach sind dabei die Regeln. Karte spielen, Aufgabe erf&uuml;llen und Punkte kassieren. Aus drei Kategorien k&ouml;nnen die Spieler eine Aufgabe w&auml;hlen: Quizfragen, Knobel- und Geschicklichkeitsaufgaben.&#10;&#10;Eine Quizfrage stellt man einem beliebigen Mitspieler. Kann dieser die Frage richtig beantworten, bekommt auch der Fragensteller Punkte. Man muss also kein Quizmaster sein, um Punkte zu bekommen. Die Mitspieler richtig einsch&auml;tzen zu k&ouml;nnen, ist viel wichtiger. Bei den Knobelaufgaben gilt es Kombinationen mit den verschiedenen Eigenschaften der Karten zu bilden: Farbe, Buchstabe oder Zahl zu Drillingen, W&ouml;rtern oder Stra&szlig;en formen und Punkte kassieren. Die Geschicklichkeitsaufgaben fordern Balance, Fingerfertigkeit und Spontanit&auml;t von den Spielern. Aber auch eine gute Beobachtungsgabe kann hilfreich sein um Punkte zu machen, gibt es ja noch diese &bdquo;Geheim&ldquo;-Karten. Passt man nicht gut auf, landet so eine fiese Karte schnell auf dem eigenen Punktestapel. Oder man verpasst eine Blitzaufgabe und kassiert Minuspunkte.&#10;&#10;Interaktivit&auml;t wird bei &bdquo;Um Himmels Willen&ldquo; gro&szlig; geschrieben. Ein Gro&szlig;teil der Aufgaben bindet mehrere Spieler mit ein. Jeder kann immer mitmachen, ist aber nicht gezwungen dazu.&#10;&#10;Durch das einzigartige Konzept wird f&uuml;r alle Altersgruppen Abwechslung, Spa&szlig; und Spannung geboten.&#10;&#10;F&uuml;r 3-6 Spieler, ab 8 Jahren.&#10;&#10;Eine spezielle Team/Familien-Variante erm&ouml;glicht es auch gr&ouml;&szlig;eren Gruppen Freude an &quot;Um Himmels Willen&quot; zu haben.&#10;&#10;F&uuml;r 2-6 Teams, ab 8 Jahren.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Star Wars: Imperial Assault is a strategy board game of tactical combat and missions for two to five players, offering two distinct games of battle and adventure in the Star Wars universe!&#10;&#10;Imperial Assault puts you in the midst of the Galactic Civil War between the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire after the destruction of the Death Star over Yavin 4. In this game, you and your friends can participate in two separate games. The campaign game pits the limitless troops and resources of the Galactic Empire against a crack team of elite Rebel operatives as they strive to break the Empire&rsquo;s hold on the galaxy, while the skirmish game invites you and a friend to muster strike teams and battle head-to-head over conflicting objectives.&#10;&#10;In the campaign game, Imperial Assault invites you to play through a cinematic tale set in the Star Wars universe. One player commands the seemingly limitless armies of the Galactic Empire, threatening to extinguish the flame of the Rebellion forever. Up to four other players become heroes of the Rebel Alliance, engaging in covert operations to undermine the Empire&rsquo;s schemes. Over the course of the campaign, both the Imperial player and the Rebel heroes gain new experience and skills, allowing characters to evolve as the story unfolds.&#10;&#10;Imperial Assault offers a different game experience in the skirmish game. In skirmish missions, you and a friend compete in head-to-head, tactical combat. You&rsquo;ll gather your own strike force of Imperials, Rebels, and Mercenaries and build a deck of command cards to gain an unexpected advantage in the heat of battle. Whether you recover lost holocrons or battle to defeat a raiding party, you&rsquo;ll find danger and tactical choices in every skirmish.&#10;&#10;As an additional benefit, the Luke Skywalker Ally Pack and the Darth Vader Villain Pack are included within the Imperial Assault Core Set. These figure packs offer sculpted plastic figures alongside additional campaign and skirmish missions that highlight both Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader within Imperial Assault.&#10;&#10;With these Imperial Assault and other Figure Packs, you'll find even more missions that allow your heroes to fight alongside iconic characters from the Star Wars saga. Boxed expansions add more heroes, imperial and mercenary groups, and totally new campaigns (see IA Community Wiki for a list), and the free Star Wars: Imperial Assault &#226;&#128;&#147; Legends of the Alliance app provides you with additional content to play in solo or co-op mode.&#10;&#10;",

A player's maximum speed, which is the number of street spaces he may move, is 5. When a player stops at a Bus Stop, he may pick up a customer card which contains 2 different customers. The customer card's point value directly correlates to the speed in which a bus' movement is reduced to, when carrying the customer card. Once a bus moves through a space with a customers' destination, the customer on the card is considered delivered. Two street tiles may be swapped if the &quot;construction&quot; space is used and a player may hold several customer cards for maximum efficiency.

        "description": "Pick a Vowel is a 2-5 player (works best with 3) board game for families. Players move together around the board collecting letters and cards, aiming to create long and high scoring words. The first player to reach the word limit (decided at the beginning) ends the game, giving all other players one more turn.&#10;&#10;There are many different strategies that can be taken, such as; &lsquo;lots of small words, a couple of long words, or go all out on completing objectives&rsquo;.&#10;&#10;The great thing about Pick a Vowel is no one is left idle. Even if it isn &rsquo;t you turn, you still move around the board collecting letters and cards. This makes it especially good for younger players as often children become bored waiting for their turn.&#10;Another great aspect about the game, is the unpredictable winner. Since there are so many ways to get points, like using words which have lots of vowels, or completing heaps of objectives, by the end of the game, the winner could really be anyone.&#10;&#10;Cards are one of the most important part of the game, as they are used to interact with other play ers, like stealing their letters, or stopping another player make a word, but also are used for perks, like increasing the value of vowels or allowing you to make two words in a turn.&#10;&#10;Pick a Vowel has many different levels of complexity, offering a light,gentle game for children, or an intense, challenging game for adults. The use of objective cards, and letter penalties increases the difficulty dramatically. The length of the game can be adjusted by simply deciding the word limit at the beginning.&#10;&#10;&quot;Very cool word game with lots of interaction, interesting twists, and very little waiting time. Makes you want to play again. Why didn't I invent this game?&quot; - Professional Game Designer and Mentor - Martin Nedergaard Anderson&#10;&#10;&quot;There are choices, you stay involved, there are different strategies that can work - but it rewards longer/more difficult words&quot; - Manager of Board Games Australia&#10;&#10;&quot;Easy to play, good pace, enjoyable - Competitive and encourages bad blood between players&quot; - Designer from Protospiel - Sydney 2014 &quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Fast pace, interactive, different levels of difficulty, great for all ages, can't predict the winner!&quot; - 18 year old play tester.&#10;&#10;",

Playing card sets are divided into three main categories: vocabulary, general knowledge, specific subjects.&#10;&#10;Answers are written into a grid of squares, but the location of the answers is decided by the players. The answers may be words, idiomatic expressions, dates, numbers or mathematical or scientific formulae.&#10;&#10;Points are awarded for each answer written onto the game board.... Each square on the board has a pre-alloted value. The board is divided into several contiguous zones. At each turn, the points scored by the eligible player are calculated by totaling the value of each of the squared occupied by the letters or characters in the answer and multiplying that by the number of zones that the answer passes through or into.&#10;&#10;",

A complete game takes about 20 to 40 minutes to play, but it can be shortened or lengthened easily. The game is comprised of several &ldquo;rounds&rdquo; where each player utilizes his mice to draw cards from any of three cheese piles in an attempt to gather cheese.  Within the cheese piles lie cheese, traps, tools, and the dreaded cat. Each player must gather the number of cheese indicated on their &ldquo;Escape&rdquo; level card and get it transferred to their nest before the other player to win the round!&#10;&#10;When a round is won, that player advances to the next highest Escape card.  The first player to finish all of their Escape cards wins the game! By removing some Escape cards the game can be shortened, or conversely adding extra Escape cards the game can be lengthened.&#10;&#10;Although the concept of the game is simple enough for even youngsters to pick up quickly, the strategy and suspense behind every card flip make this an addictive game for all ages!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Cards and dice game. There are 9 cards representing the skittles 1 to 9. They are shuffled and laid out in a diamond formation. Then the player in his turn, reveals the 9 cards and rolls the three dice supplied. A skittle is hit if the number on a card corresponds with the numbers on the dice,either as an individual figure or the sum of 2 or 3 dice. In this way combinations of the dice may be used to knock over as many skittles (turn them over) as the player can. There are rules about which skittles in a layout are covered by other skittles. This cannot be knocked over until the skittle(s) covering them are knocked over first.&#10;&#10;Players in their turn can throw the dice three times. Every skittle knocked over scores a point. If all 9 are knocked over in three rolls, then the score is 12 instead of 9. If you can knock them all over in just two throws, you score 15. First player to 77 points wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "(from MMP website:)&#10;&#10;In July, 1763, Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) was under siege as part of Pontiac&rsquo;s Rebellion. A relief column was sent out from Carlisle in order to try and break the siege. The column was under the command of Colonel Henry Bouquet and consisted of approximately 500 British soldiers of the 42nd Highlanders, 77th Highlanders, and 60th Royal Americans.&#10;&#10;On August 5th, several hundred Indian warriors of the Delaware, Shawnee, Mingo, and Huron tribes attacked the column east of Bushy Run Station. The British held out, and that night a redoubt was constructed from the supplies, and the wounded were treated inside this perimeter. The next day, the Indians attacked again, and a British counterattack broke the Indians. The British column was able to advance, and relieve Fort Pitt on August 10th.&#10;&#10;The Battle of Bushy Run game uses a simplified version of Iwo Jima: Rage Against the Marines (in Operations Special Magazine Issue #1). The American Indian units use a concealed map and have dummy units to help hide their movement. The British force is a mix of soldiers, grenadiers, and scouts (who can reveal hidden Indian units). To increase replayability there are random events each turn (8 turns, 10 event chits, so 2 are not played each game...their identify is not revealed). Both sides have multiple ways in which they can secure victory.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "bot&middot;net - &quot;A network of private computers infected with malicious software and controlled as a group without the owners' knowledge.&quot;&#10; In botNET, Hackers compete for notoriety and power by building the largest and most powerful network of computers. Mastering botNET requires careful planning, strategy, and a touch of game theory.&#10;&#10;The game is broken into five actions where Hackers: &#10;&#10;     Scan the Internet (draw deck) to download new Nodes (cards), &#10;     Connect the nodes to the network on the table&#10;     Mine encryption keys that can unlock new Nodes&#10;     Hack nodes by moving an Avatar to the node and using the keys. &#10;     Recruit &lsquo;whitehat&rsquo; or &lsquo;blackhat&rsquo; hackers to your side.     &#10;&#10;&#10;Each Node has a Type which determines what it does as well as a security level that shows how hard it is to hack and where in the network it is allowed to go.&#10;&#10;Each node type is associated with a shape:&#10;&#10;     Miners (Triangle) -  Computers that crunch numbers to generate encryption keys. &#10;     Storage (Square) - Databases that store nodes or encryption keys.&#10;     Applications (Circle) - Programs that enhance specific actions. &#10;     Botnets (Hexagon)- Hackers earn street cred by connecting new nodes to these networks. &#10;&#10;&#10;The color of a Node determines its Security Level:&#10;&#10;     Home (Blue) nodes are small systems owned by individuals.&#10;     Commercial (Green) nodes belong to small and medium businesses. &#10;     Cloud (Orange) nodes are located in the data centers of giant multinational corporations. &#10;     Government (Red) nodes belong to a national Government and are very difficult to hack. &#10;&#10;&#10;Cards in the network must respect the security levels. For instance, Home nodes may never be directly connected to Cloud or Government Nodes without a Commercial Node in between.&#10;&#10;A hidden war is being waged between two hacker groups: the Freedom Foundation, whose membership includes altruistic Whitehat hackers, and the Cracker Coalition, which is made up of ruthless Blackhat Hackers.&#10;&#10;Street credit, or &ldquo;Cred&rdquo; is a crucial currency in the Hacker world. In botNET it is represented by White or Black glass tokens that indicate if the Cred is &lsquo;Whitehat&rsquo; or &lsquo;Blackhat&rsquo;. Connecting nodes to Botnets earn Cred from one of the two hacker groups. One earned, Cred can be used to the Hackers advantage by acquiring contacts and issuing exploits. &#10; Contacts are shadowy individuals that will assist you but may switch allegiances at the drop of a hat. Contacts have secret knowledge that can make hacks easier and will pay you if you can gain control over the Nodes they desire. Unscrupulous rivals may turn informant and report Contacts to the police. Who will keep their mouth shut and who will rat?&#10;&#10;",

The game consists of 6 rounds, each player tries to win a round by scoring points for different card combinations.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, he chooses any one card in his hand and places it face up on the playing area trying to match it by suit (curtain colour) with one on the table and take both into his point pile. If he cannot match a card from his hand, he must discard a card face up to the table. After matching or discarding a card, he then draws one card from the deck and places it face up on the playing area. If this card matches any card now on the table, he must match that card and take both for his point pile; otherwise, it becomes part of the table. In the event that the drawn card matches more than one card on the table, the player gets to choose which card to match and keep in addition to the drawn card.&#10;&#10;",

Like real-life divorce mediation, players will have to make tense decisions. Do you take an item that you want--or do you prevent your opponent from getting an item that might be valuable to them? As you fight for your house and your kids, you'll have to play dirty: use lawyers to steal back items, plant incriminating evidence on your opponent, and buy bribes to get the edge. The deck includes cards like Alimony, Mistrial, Tax Fraud, and more, granting players unique abilities to use during the game. In addition, you can sell off your possessions to the Pawn Shop in order to fund the legal proceedings. At the end of the game, the parent that won over their children's hearts gets to take them home--and all the child support that goes along with it.&#10;&#10;",

After the king's death, the powerful dukes and counts of the land are fighting for supremacy. You are one of these nobles, looking to write your name in the annals of history. You will use your citizens to develop your lands, muster armies, and amass wealth. You may even try to secure the goodwill of influential public figures, like the remainders of the royal family. But never forget to keep the dishonest parts of your society in check: Excessive corruption may lead to your downfall sooner than you think. The goal is clear!&#10;&#10;But the path you take to get there is yours to decide: Will you be a peaceful protector of the royal family? Or maybe a warlord, taking what you want by force? Or will you fail to fulfill your ambitions and be lost among the anonymous masses? Take up the king's pouch and find out!&#10;&#10;King's Pouch is a &quot;pouch-building&quot; strategy game set in a medieval kingdom. Each round offers tough choices on how to expand your pool of citizens and buildings. Using the resources you acquire, you may raise powerful armies or secure the support of powerful characters. In the game, you will use several kinds of citizens (cubes and prisms) in different ways, with the ultimate goal of earning prestige points. Your pool of citizens is represented by your pouch: You draw available citizens from there and return used citizens to the pouch only when you cannot draw any more because it is empty. (This concept is similar to the deck-building concept seen in other games.)&#10;&#10;The game takes place over nine rounds. At the end of rounds 3, 6 and 9, a great council allows for the scoring of additional prestige points from influential characters and conquered territories. After the ninth round, the game ends with the third great council and a final scoring in which you can gain or lose points depending on your corrupt officials and buildings, then the player with the most prestige points wins.&#10;&#10;",

The twist is that the person who has the most points of each sin does not score those points, but everyone else does.&#10;&#10;7Sins! has 5 decks with each card representing a sin and has a value between 1 and 7 representing the severity of the sin.  The main deck consists of 80 cards and contains Wrath, Greed, Lust, and Pride.  There are three separate decks for the remaining sins - Gluttony contains 25 cards, Envy has 20 cards, and Sloth has 20 cards.  The final deck is the Original Sins deck.  It has 28 cards and contains all seven sins in values between 2 and 4.&#10;&#10;To begin, 4 Original Sins cards are dealt to each player.  Each player keeps 2 cards and passes one each to the right and left.  They are then set aside until the end of the game.  The Original Sins have no effect on basic game play but will count during scoring.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with 3 cards from the main deck.  Players take turns playing a card and following any instructions on the card, then drawing a card from the main deck to end their turn.  Each sin has a different thematic effect for that sin.&#10;&#10;The game ends when any player has accumulated 7 or more points of Pride. Players should discard their hands (these cards are no longer needed), and then add their original sins to the sins they played during the game. Counting one sin at a time, players should announce how many points they have. Whoever has the most points in each sin is 'shunned' and must discard all those points - in case of a tie, all players discard the points. Everyone else 'gets away with' those sins and keeps those points.  Once the biggest sinner for each sin has discarded those points, each player totals up everything they 'got away with' and the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

Because of the MadLibs-inspired storytelling twist to this game, each prompt (Story) card can set up literally hundreds of different situations. The judge (called the Bard, in keeping with the storytelling theme) plays cards for whichever of the categories (Fool, Crisis or Bad Decision) come up in the first two blanks on that Story card; the other Players complete the story by anonymously playing a card from their hands to fill the final blank. The Bard chooses the winning Story ending, and passes the role of Bard on to the next Player to the left.&#10;&#10;Because you can't make the dumbest stories up, the cards in the core set have themes of bad decisions in headline news and technology, the latter being decided on by a vote of the kickstarter backers. Both themes are populated by hilariously wrong cards drawn from news stories and anecdotes researched from various online and print sources, or sometimes personally related to the creators of the game.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Faro, Pharaoh, or Farobank, is a late 17th-century French gambling card game descendant of basset, and belongs to the lansquenet and Monte Bank family of games, in that it is played between a banker and several players winning or losing according to the cards turned up matching those already exposed or not.&#10;&#10;Although not a direct relative of poker, faro was played by the masses alongside its other popular counterpart, due to its fast action, easy-to-learn rules, and better odds than most games of chance. The game of faro is played with only one deck of cards and allows for any number of players.&#10;&#10;A game of faro was often called a faro bank. It was played with an entire deck of playing cards. One person was designated the &quot;banker&quot; and an indeterminate number of players, known as &quot;punters&quot;, could be admitted. Chips (called &quot;checks&quot;) were purchased by the punter from the banker (or house) from which the game originated. Bet values and limits were set by the house. Usual check values were 50 cents to $10 each.&#10;&#10;The faro table was typically oval, covered with green baize, and had a cutout for the banker. A board with a standardized betting layout consisting of all cards of one suit pasted to it in numerical order, called the &quot;layout&quot;, was placed on top of the table. Traditionally, the suit of spades was used for the layout. Each player laid his stake on one of the 13 cards on the layout. Players could place multiple bets and could bet on multiple cards simultaneously by placing their bet between cards or on specific card edges. Players also had the choice of betting on the &ldquo;high card&rdquo; bar located at the top of the layout.&#10;&#10;Faro was popular in eighteenth century Europe and nineteenth century America, particularly on the frontier. It was also often rigged since it did not offer the house a substantial advantage. Once gambling houses became more regulated and cheating was less tolerated, Faro declined. By 1985 it was no longer played in any of the Nevada casinos. It is remembered today mostly by historians and associated with some of its most famous players and dealers, including Casanova, Charles James Fox, Wyatt Earp, and John &quot;Doc&quot; Holliday.&#10;&#10;",

The choice is not simple, however, as only a proper balance between various types of infantry, cavalry and artillery will make for a strong army.&#10;&#10;",

In the game, which is playable strictly by four players, you each represent one of four characters and your goal is to solve mysteries or crimes by sharing information with one another &mdash; but you are quite restricted in how you can share information!&#10;&#10;Witness includes 64 cases for you to solve, and each case starts with an explanatory scene or image or both that someone reads or shows to the group. Each player then looks in his personal casebook to find information available only to his character. Players randomly decide who shares information first and in which direction, e.g., player A might whisper information to player B while player C talks to player D. Next, B will share both his information and A's information to C while D talks to A.&#10;&#10;After two more rounds of the most inefficient crime-solving system ever created, players read the conclusion of the case, which might offer additional information or another visual, then they each individually answer three questions about the case, with the group scoring one point for each correct answer for a final score ranging from 0 to 12.&#10;&#10;",

As workers, they lumbered wood, hunted salmon,&#10;and mined for ore. A hard life. As soon as they saw a weakness, though,&#10;the tribe banded together, attacking the next settlement over. Some died,&#10;the surviving warriors stand fast und challenged the old jarls.&#10;&#10;In Nord, each player leads a clan, ordering workers and fishermen, performing attacks, uniting settlements, and providing their fighters with raw materials and food. Each player starts with one jarl and one warrior in a settlement, and a typical game turn takes up to three steps:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Place New Workers: A player places up to three workers in one land area or up to two with boats on the sea.&#10;    Attack a Settlement: If two enemy settlements are now connected by the new workers, a raid starts; the player's northmen in the connection attack, some die, some invade victorious, some return with the spoils of war.&#10;    Score Points: If the dragon boat is filled with dead northmen, the next scoring is triggered. When resources are scored players get points for having men delivering wood and iron to their warriors. These are scored in the warriors scoring where some might not survive the winter when not enough food is provided. Alternatively a player might, if he feels strong enough, duel a foreign jarl to receive points of glory.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends after the fourth scoring with a final scoring of treasures that the players hoarded throughout the game. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

The game consists of alternating turns where players can take one of three possible actions: infection, placement, or passing.  An infection is the act of swapping two or more dice for one of an opponent's dice.  A placement is the act of putting a die onto the dice pyramid according to a set of specific rules.  A player can only pass if they've run out of dice to play before the other player has.&#10;&#10;It's an important aspect of Pidan that the players are ultimately responsible for placing all of the dice in their nest onto the pyramid, including those belonging to their opponent.&#10;&#10;When all of the dice have been placed onto the pyramid the players sum the points showing to determine the scores for each side. The player with the highest total on the majority of sides wins the game. Ties are broken by awarding the player whose die resides in the innermost cell.&#10;&#10;",

It is done by destroying (or &quot;Crashing&quot;) all seven cards of their Life Cloth and then dealing the final strike. Players can attack either with their LRIG or summoned beings called SIGNI that come from the Main deck. &#10;Over the course of the game, players can &quot;Grow&quot; their LRIG with cards from the LRIG deck, getting access to more powerful SIGNI and various LRIG abilities. Both decks also have cards with one-shot effects: Arts (in the LRIG deck) and Spells (in the Main deck). These cards, as well as Growing a LRIG, require spending a certain amounts of Ener, which is represented by cards in your Ener Zone. You can put cards from both your hand and your side of the field into your Ener Zone once a turn. It is also the zone where defeated SIGNI and crashed Life Cloth cards go to. Some cards also produce additional effects called Life Bursts if they are crashed from the Life Cloth.&#10;&#10;",

Compete to win in this new card game based on a real life robotics competition!&#10;&#10;Aerial Assault is based on the real-life robotics competition presented by FIRST. Every year, FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) develops an exciting new game. Teams only have six weeks to design, build, and test a robot to play the game. Aerial Assault is inspired by the 2014 competition.  With Aerial Assault, you can now work through a four-month season in 30 minutes by building a robot, training your drivers, and competing against other teams in matches.&#10;&#10;In the build phase, players select robot parts (cards) and build their robot. For driver training, players build their action deck and draft cards that represent special capabilities.  Finally, the robots compete two on two (or three on three in the deluxe game) to drive, shoot, and block their way to victory.&#10;&#10;",

There are three levels of play, increasing in difficulty for older children with more advanced vocabularies.&#10;&#10;In each level of play, children choose cards, write the words on those cards onto the Scrabble-like grid game board, and then score points based on the values of the squares.&#10;&#10;In the lower-level games, an adult helper reads the word to the child and helps him or her write the word on the grid.  In higher-level games, children must guess the word based on a given definition and then write it on the grid, scoring points based on both the values of the squares and the number of &quot;zones&quot; the word passes through.&#10;&#10;Chance squares introduce an random element.  If a word crosses one, the player writing the word chooses a card that can earn them bonus points or cause them to lose points.&#10;&#10;",

Players start off with a single worker, representing themselves, and every season the farm will grow in the form of a new worker. These must be handled with care and fed, or they will abandon you, costing precious points in the end. Every turn will also bring a new weather condition, which will influence how the turn is played out. Ranging from nice sunny days to terrible blizzards, they will either help you or hurt you.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the last turn of Winter has passed by, and points are scored depending on the players' farm performance at the end.&#10;&#10;",
