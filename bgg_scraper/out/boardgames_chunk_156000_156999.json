Roberts Award-winning design team of Wes Erni and Ben Madison at Victory Point Games, is a solitaire States of SiegeTM game where you represent the two largest pre-Columbian Indian &ldquo;mound builder&rdquo; cultures that dominated eastern North America from before the time of Christ until the coming of the European colonists in the 17th century. Your empire represents the earlier Hopewell culture and the later Mississippian culture that derived from it.&#10;&#10;Until the arrival of the Spanish late in the game, you will expand your control across the map of North America, extending it over the various chiefdoms encountered and incorporating them into your economic and religious sphere (&ldquo;empire&rdquo;). Your domain will grow and shrink, but be aware that rather than a military advance and retreat, this process represents the rise and decline of culture, religious ideology, and an economic way of life, threatened from outside by competing ideologies and lifestyles as much as by hostile armies.&#10;&#10;Your goal is to extend Mound Builder culture and amass as many chiefdoms as possible before rival native powers (and the smallpox-ridden Spanish!) rise up to drive you back to your Mississippi River heartland and extinguish your vast capital city at Cahokia, Illinois &ndash; near modern St. Louis.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, a player can first draw as many cards as he likes, one at a time from the deck, placing them in the harbor (an area near the deck). Each card shows one of the following:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Person, who stays in a face-up row next to deck.&#10;     Ship, which the player can attack immediately if he has enough swords on his people cards, after which the ship is discarded; otherwise, the ship stays in the harbor.&#10;     Expedition, which remains above the harbor until a player fulfills it by discarding people who have the items required for the expedition.&#10;     Tax Increase, which forces everyone with twelve or more coins to discard half their money, after which the card is discarded.&#10;&#10;&#10;If the player draws a ship with the same name as a ship already in the harbor, he's spent too much time dilly-dallying and his turn ends (after using the ship to attack, if possible), with all the cards in the harbor being discarded. Otherwise, the player can stop whenever he likes, then use/acquire one card if three or fewer ships are in the harbor, two cards if four ships are present, and three cards if five ships are present. Players rob ships, collecting the number of coins shown on them, then discarding the card, while they hire people, paying the number of coins depicted. After the active player takes his 1-3 cards, each other player may pay the active player one coin in order to take one card in the same way.&#10;&#10;When one player has at least twelve influence points &mdash; which are on both people and expedition cards &mdash; the game is played to the end of the round, giving everyone the same number of turns, then the player with the most influence points wins.&#10;&#10;&bull; Port Royal differs from H&auml;ndler der Karibik in that it includes ten more cards to allow for play with up to five players and players can win without fulfilling an expedition.&#10;&#10;",

Pieces may move in any direction.  Cattle pieces move to an open adjacent circle or by jumping a friendly or opponent piece to a vacant circle on the other side.  Cowboys move this way, but also may jump over any number of pieces in a row to reach a vacant circle on the opposite side.  Pieces are not removed from the board.&#10;&#10;The first player to move all of his pieces to the opposite side and match the piece numbers to the board numbers wins the game.

You determined to keep your job, have returned &ndash; only to find the situation is even more turbulent then before: more planes, less controllers, and high competition. &#10;But that doesn't faze you, because you are an AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER.&#10;&#10;In this turbulent game you control 7 planes, of which 5 must reach your landing strip to win! You have three actions each turn with which you may: Take-Off, Move across one Air Current, Rotate, or Swap&#10;Seems simple right? Not exactly. Rotating and Swapping can only be done if your planes are touching the tiles so the more planes you have on the board, the more power you have. In the mean time your opponent will be trying to get their planes in and pushing or crashing (yes you can collide into other planes) to prevent you from getting there first! You'll be swapping, pushing, rotating, crashing, landing, taking-off, and triple pushing in this game of TURBULENCE.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Superpowerful Bonanza is a handmade cardboard/spruce-wood multilevel three-dimensional board game developed by You Tube's Homemade Game Guru. The game features a new line of comic book superheroes competing to save their city from five super villain bosses. Each hero character has an origin story and mission to complete (explained in an accompanying one-shot comic book). The game play was inspired by classic side-scrolling video games like Double Dragon and Contra.&#10;&#10;Each hero and villain has a main game card that lists their 1)strength, 2)speed and 3)intelligence points. Each hero must add to their strength, speed and intelligence points by collecting cards based on weapons, health, powers and superpowers. Cards are collected by moving along playing spaces in each level. Game cards accumulated not only provide point levels for strength, speed and intelligence, but they also give specific instructions on their limitations and extra abilities. Some cards can be kept and others are one-time use.&#10;&#10;Players compete to gain as many points as possible before taking on each level's villainous boss. Each boss has a complete deck of cards to fuel their strength, speed and intelligence points. Once a boss is reached, a player must duel card-to-card and hope they have the right combination of points to win. Even before players reach the level boss, they must combat minor enemies and deal with civilians (which can help or hinder the mission). Each of the 5 levels plays slightly different from the rest.&#10;&#10;",

Each player is given seven cards: 4 Nobles, 2 Thieves, and 1 Knight. The game also includes 6 Treasure cards. (Also included in the box is an expansion adding additional roles with other effects on the scoring and gameplay.)&#10;&#10;The game starts with as many Treasure cards as there are players stacked in a face-down pile. Players then take turns playing a card from their hand face down on top of the stack, announcing it as one of the cards it might or might not actually be can be (Knight, Noble, or Thief).&#10;&#10;After all players have played all their cards, the deck is flipped over and the cards are scored in order.&#10;&#10;Thieves will take all cards played before them, unless the next card (played right after it) is a Knight. The Thief (or Knight), and all the cards taken are given to the player who played it, and then the remaining cards are scored - up to the next Thief.&#10;&#10;A Knight by himself does not take any cards. Only Knights right after Thieves can take any cards.&#10;&#10;Treasure and Noble cards do not have any effect, but do count toward scoring when they have been taken.&#10;&#10;If you look at them left to right, with the bottommost treasure cards on the left, a sample game might look like this:&#10;&#10;An example 3-player game, with Red, Blue, and Green, using K, N, T, and X to represent Knights, Nobles, Thieves, and Treasure&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &#10;         X&#10;&#10;         X&#10;&#10;         X&#10;&#10;         N&#10;&#10;         T&#10;&#10;         N&#10;&#10;         T&#10;&#10;         K&#10;&#10;         N&#10;&#10;         K&#10;&#10;         N&#10;&#10;         T&#10;&#10;         N&#10;&#10;         N&#10;&#10;         ...&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Blue's Thief is not beaten by a Knight (Green played a Noble after it) so Blue gets 5 cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &#10;         N&#10;&#10;         T&#10;&#10;         K&#10;&#10;         N&#10;&#10;         K&#10;&#10;         N&#10;&#10;         T&#10;&#10;         N&#10;&#10;         N&#10;&#10;         ...&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Blue's Knight beats Red's Thief, and Blue gets 3 more cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &#10;         N&#10;&#10;         K&#10;&#10;         N&#10;&#10;         T&#10;&#10;         N&#10;&#10;         N&#10;&#10;         ...&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Red's Knight does nothing.

The patients on the ward are dreaming of the traumatosaures, creatures from another dimension, who appear in the hospital and try to absorb the patients so they can return home.&#10;&#10;The game takes place in hourly turns over the course of one night. One player takes the role of the nursing staff, who move around getting treatments (pills, injections, and electroshock devices), administering treatments, waking up sleeping patients, and moving patients from room to room. However, they do not have free choice when moving the nurses; for each one a die is rolled, giving two possible rooms they can go to.&#10;&#10;The traumatosaure player moves the traumatosaures that have appeared in the hospital (because the matching patients fell asleep) and moves them, also using die rolls, which now determine how far to move (half speed if the patient is now awake). The traumatosaure player also has a certain number of &quot;AARRGGHH&quot; tokens which can be used on patients to make it harder to help them.&#10;&#10;The advanced game adds fixed events which take place each turn.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Imperialism: Road to Domination approximately covers the period from the 15th to the 19th century. The players control superpowers and attempt to transform them into mighty empires. To accomplish this, they will not only have to look after the economic growth and try to gain social and civilization achievements, but also modernize and expand their fleet and land army. Because being at war is expensive, it is often wiser to resort to plots and lies. Sometimes, making empty promises at the negotiating tables is better than getting involved in a risky and exhausting war, which may empty the treasury and expose you to losing precious prestige. The players have to pay extra attention to the dissenters who, especially in the beginning of the game, have greater military power and will not hesitate to draw others into a religious war. Will you manage to create an enormous colonial empire, military European dominion, or a territorially small but economically strong country? The players&rsquo; choices, luck, and reactions of others will affect the struggle. Creating an empire requires good strategic sense and a flexible approach to changing military and economic situations. The players have to forge thoughtful alliances and avoid wars which they may not win.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to create the most powerful empire. To achieve this, the players will change the reigning rulers, brew plots, conspire, conquer minor countries and overseas lands which will increase the level of goods production in their empire. The players will have to expand their armies and fleet to confront other superpowers. The player with the most glory points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Each turn players play cards from their hand to the table.&#10;&#10;Each card has two ways that it can be played. They can be laid down in a pyramid formation for their numerical value to score points, or for it's special ability. Players play their blueprint cards to the table to score the most points and can bluff about what they are playing and use the special abilities to switch the positions of the blueprints, use agent cards to reveal an opponent's cards, block an opponent's progress and more.&#10;&#10;The pyramid is like a 'technology tree' where the lowest levels represent the infrastructure and the levels above represent your satellites, rockets and manned missions.&#10;&#10;The game is played over three rounds and the winner is the player with the most points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;",

With everyone playing at once, players place one or more fuel balls on their landing pad, place their spinner ship over these balls, then moves their ship in circles so quickly that centrifugal force holds the balls up and doesn't let them fall through the hole in the bottom of the spinner ship. Place your ship on top of the mother ship and let your fuel balls fall inside; if someone else places a spinner on top of yours, you're pinned until their fuel is loaded, so you want to get in and out as quickly as possible &mdash; but that's tricky to do because if you don't spin your ship quickly, your fuel will eject before you've reached the mother ship!&#10;&#10;If you drop a ball, you pick it up, then place it on your landing pad later for another go. Whoever loads her fuel first wins!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The year is 1886 in a small forgettable hovel of a town on the border of nowhere. Several unscrupulous individuals come together for a hand of poker over a pile of cash. A whispered accusation of chicanery crosses the table and irons are yanked from holsters. The sparse crowd dives for cover and lead arcs towards flesh, the saloon aching for a fresh coat of crimson.&#10;&#10;A Fistful of Dinero, the first game published by Magic House Games, is a card game for 3-6 players set in the wild west. After a poker game goes terribly wrong, players draw their weapons, make a quick grab for the cash, throw chairs, dive for cover, and do everything they can to be the richest gunslinger &mdash; or just the last man standing...&#10;&#10;At the start of a round, players draft cards and place (program) them in one of three slots. Then in player order, players reveal the first slot and take one of the two available actions. Players can fire their weapons, hide beyond cover, switch weapons, grab money, etc. Players also have the opportunity to &quot;throw&quot; chairs or other items (cards) onto an opponent's player board to do additional damage.&#10;&#10;The game ends in two ways: If a player takes five points of damage, he's dead and out of the game, with the last man (or woman!) standing winning it all. Alternatively, if the pot of dinero ever runs out, the richest outlaw wins.&#10;&#10;Highlights Include:&#10;-Card Drafting with Conflict&#10;-Action Programming&#10;-Completely unique cover system based on seating location&#10;-Literally throw chairs, tables, knives, tomahawks, and dynamite at your opponents by physically tossing cards&#10;-Descriptive wounds with story flair and lasting repercussions&#10;-Intense narrative that unfolds organically from actions performed (heavily inspired by the classic Avalon Hill game Gunslinger)&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Based on the hit TV series, in Sons of Anarchy: Men of Mayhem players take the role of rival gangs out to control territory, accumulate contraband and reap the monetary rewards of illegal enterprise.&#10;&#10;With each turn gangs must attempt to control a range of sites by assigning gang members and resources to claiming, defending and fighting for money, contraband and guns. However, other players can challenge the right for territory, which will lead to conflict! Negotiate, threaten and ally with rival gangs when it serves your needs, but be wary of the inevitable knife in the back. This game is about making and breaking alliances, and only the gang with the most money at the end of six rounds wins.&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS&#10;Early copies of SoA: Men of Mayhem included a manual listing incorrect component counts. The corrected component counts are:&#10;&#10;4 Clubhouse cards (1 per player)&#10;4 Player blinds (1 per player)&#10;4 Dice (1 per player)&#10;20 Members (5 per player)&#10;20 Prospects (5 per player)&#10;&#10;24 Site Tiles&#10;36 Anarchy Cards&#10;4 Hardcore Anarchy Cards (identifiable by a red border)&#10;136 Cash&#10;34 Order tokens&#10;16 Heat tokens&#10;24 Contraband&#10;24 Guns&#10;1 Reaper Patch&#10;&#10;NOTES&#10;&#10;+  Due to a packing error many first print copies of the game are missing a reference card, 'The Black Market'. You can find the PDF for this card in the files section of this page. The missing card also comes in both the Sons of Anarchy: Men of Mayhem &#226;&#128;&#147; Grim Bastards Club Expansion and Sons of Anarchy: Men of Mayhem &#226;&#128;&#147; Calaveras Club Expansion.&#10;&#10;+  First print copies of SoA: Men of Mayhem include a promo Clubhouse Card for the 'Grim Bastards' Motorcycle Club, which can be used as a substitute for one of the other playable gangs. This promo is also now available as part of a full 5th player expansion in the Sons of Anarchy: Men of Mayhem &#226;&#128;&#147; Grim Bastards Club Expansion.&#10;&#10;",

If the round's customer buys your product, you win!&#10;&#10;To set up Snake Oil: Elixir, each player takes six purple word cards. The customer for the round draws a customer card and announces it. Inventors quickly combine two purple word cards from their hand to form a crazy new product to sell to that customer. When ready, each inventor quickly pitches his or her product directly to the customer. The customer can end any pitch that goes longer than thirty seconds. The customer decides which product to buy and gives the inventor of that product the round's customer card as the prize. Inventors discard all used word cards and take two new word cards each. The player to the left of the customer becomes the next round's customer. Play repeats until each player has been the customer once.&#10;&#10;Whoever collects the most customer cards wins.&#10;&#10;Integrates with:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Snake Oil&#10;    Snake Oil: Party Potion&#10;&#10;&#10;",

That player has a few seconds to name something from the chosen category. The time shortens as play progresses. If the player can't name something before the timer flashes the next light that player is out. Once someone is out they press their assigned button and the timer stops.

For decades, fierce wars broke out and in combat after combat, deaths tolled thousands, in battles and massacres with no sign of peace. In one of these battles, the sky suddenly roared and the earth broke open abruptly, unleashing countless swarms of zombies of the modern world that rushed in from the unearthly crevice. The sudden invasion of these monstrous creatures brought unprecedented threat to the entire world. With their highly infectious ability and agility, the zombies rapidly broke out and were quickly becoming unstoppable. To avoid annihilation, all kingdoms were forced to set aside their long hatred towards each other and joined the line to fight for the survival of mankind.&#10;&#10;Dark Age Z is a strategic board game for 2 to 5 players. You are one of the kings in the Dark Age. All players strive to gain as many victory points (VP) as possible by killing the zombies that attack the Frontiers of the Kingdom Cities. At the end of the game, the player with the highest VPs wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

One player will be the &quot;Socker.&quot;  The other players each take a wooden ball with a string attached and place it into the center of a ring on the table, holding on to the string.  The Socker then holds a rubber cup in one hand and rolls a pair of six-sided dice.&#10;&#10;Whenever the Socker rolls a seven or eleven (SOCK-O!) he must then slap the cup down and try to catch one or more of the balls in the ring.  If he catches someone, they must give him a chip.  If he fails to catch someone, he must give them a chip.  Players who pull away prematurely are penalized a chip.  If the Socker mistakenly slaps the cup down, he is penalized a chip for every player whose piece is still in the ring.&#10;&#10;The Socker continues rolling the dice until he has had three SOCK-O's, at which point he trades with the player to his left and play continues with the new Socker.  The player with the most chips when the game ends (by default or agreement) wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Deception: Murder in Hong Kong is a game of deduction and deception for 4-12 players that plays in about 20 minutes.&#10;&#10;In the game, players take on the roles of investigators attempting to solve a murder case &ndash; but there's a twist. The killer is one of the investigators! Each player's role and team are randomly assigned at the start of play and include the unique roles of Forensic Scientist, Witness, Investigator, Murderer, and Accomplice. While the Investigators attempt to deduce the truth, the murderer's team must deceive and mislead. This is a battle of wits!&#10;&#10;The Forensic Scientist has the solution but can express the clues only using special scene tiles while the investigators (and the murderer) attempt to interpret the evidence. In order to succeed, the investigators must not only deduce the truth from the clues of the Forensic Scientist, they must also see through the misdirection being injected into the equation by the Murderer and Accomplice!&#10;&#10;Find out who among you can cut through deception to find the truth and who is capable of getting away with murder!&#10;&#10;Roles&#10;&#10;Forensic Scientist x1&#10;As the game master, the Forensic Scientist holds the solution to the crime. They are responsible for assisting the Investigators in identifying the &ldquo;Key Evidence&rdquo; and &ldquo;Means of Murder.&rdquo; When an Investigator does that successfully, the crime is solved and the Forensic Scientist and the Investigators win the game.&#10;&#10;During the game, the Forensic Scientist is NOT allowed to hint to the solution with words, gestures, or eyes.&#10;&#10;Murderer x1&#10;When the crime takes place, the Murderer chooses 1 Clue card and 1 Means card as the solution to the crime. These will be the &ldquo;Key Evidence&rdquo; and &ldquo;Means of Murder&rdquo; respectively.&#10;&#10;The Murderer tries to hide their role and look for a scapegoat. Even if they are identified, the Murderer still wins the game if no one correctly identifies both the &ldquo;Key Evidence&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Means of Murder&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;Investigators x8&#10;To solve the crime, the Investigators must analyze the hints given by the Forensic Scientist. As long as one of the Investigators correctly identifies both the &ldquo;Key Evidence&rdquo; and &ldquo;Means of Murder,&rdquo; the Murderer is arrested and the Investigators win the game (as does the Forensic Scientist).&#10;&#10;Bear in mind that the Murderer (and sometimes Accomplice) is among the Investigators! The innocent Investigators must make a vigorous effort to defend themselves from false accusation.&#10;&#10;Accomplice x1&#10;The Accomplice is an optional role for games with six or more players. The Accomplice knows who the Murderer is, as well as the solution to the crime. The Accomplice and Murderer both win if the Murderer gets away with his crime.&#10;&#10;Witness x1&#10;The Witness is an optional role when playing with six or more players.* The Witness is an Investigator who has witnessed the culprits leaving the crime scene. They have no way of knowing which is the Murderer and which is the Accomplice and they do not know how the crime was committed.&#10;&#10;If the Murderer is arrested but can identify the Witness, the Witness is considered to be killed, allowing the Murderer and the Accomplice to get away with murder and win the game.&#10;&#10;",

When opponents land on players owned property, the owning player collects rent from the landing player. Owning sets of properties increases the rent paid to the player who owns them, by the player who lands on the square. The ultimate goal is to have the most money and drive opponents into bankruptcy.&#10;&#10;Another version of the classic Monopoly. This time the cases represent the German company &quot;Bankhaus W&ouml;lbern&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

Also, from time to time there are unexpected events (such as Pig Shows and Sausage Fest) which offer players great opportunities to outperform their peers.&#10;&#10;There are four rounds to each season, and all unvaccinated pigs die at each season change. The game concludes at the end of four seasons, when all pigs are sold off at different prices in accordance with their sizes. The player with the highest profit at the end wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

The main features of the rules are:&#10;&#10;The playing pieces - model figures and vehicles mounted on stands - represent battalion-sized or regiment-sized units, depending upon the type of unit being represented. These units are allocated Strength Points (SP) which relate to each unit's type (e.g. Infantry, Cavalry, Armour), strength, equipment, and level of training. Strength Point markers are attached to the back of each stand, and are changed when the unit loses Strength Points as a result of combat.&#10;&#10;The ground scale used is very large (1:25,000 in games using 20 mm scale figures and vehicles and 1:50,000 in games using 1:300th scale figures and vehicles).&#10;&#10;The game moves represent two hours of actual time.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "On 28 June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his wife were shot dead in Sarajevo, by Gavrilo Princip, member of the Black Hand, a political organization seeking for a merging of the Balkan area into a Greater Serbia or a Yugoslavia.&#10;&#10;Austria-Hungary subsequently issued an ultimatum against Serbia. As the ultimatum was rejected, Austria-Hungary then declared war, marking the outbreak of the war.&#10;&#10;While France and Russia immediately sided with Serbia, Germany joined the Austria-Hungary and started a surprise offensive in the west with the objective of quickly defeating the French, to then turn east and knock the Tzarist Russia out of the war.&#10;&#10;&#10;1914 is a game of World War I conflict simulation at the strategic level. It recalls the most decisive battles fought by Austria-Hungary on both the Balkan and the Eastern Front in 1914. Although based on historical events and battles, the players in command of the two factions can modify the evolution of World War I.&#10;&#10;The game is recommended for two or four players, but has a good solitaire suitability.&#10;&#10;Developed with a system of wooden blocks and cubes and played out over 2 70x90 cm multicolor mapboards, with more than 300 wooden/plastic components created by the best Italian artisinal industry and painted &quot;A buratto&quot;, a technique usually adopted for painting car parts and accessories.&#10;&#10;The rules are divided into three major sections which can be learned one at a time:&#10;&bull; The Basic Game Rules introduce the basic concepts and enable players to start playing the game without too many rules to remember.&#10;&bull; The Advanced Game Rules provide more specific and detailed rules for enhanced realism.&#10;&bull; The Optional Rules are for those who want to get the most out of the game, with rules for Strategic Warfare, Amphibious Landings, and more.&#10;&#10;In 1914, 1 cm is approximately 10 km, a turn is 1 month long, and a full-strength counter represents a major military formation, normally corps size with some divisions and brigades.&#10;&#10;The game can be played with &quot;Fog of War&quot; on (with the faces of wooden blocks hidden from the opponent) or off (all units are visible).&#10;&#10;",

His seminal work, the Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, which is Latin for &quot;Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy&quot;, laid the foundation for classical mechanics.&#10;&#10;In Newton's Noggin, 2-4 players manipulate ideas inside Newton's head to formulate the concepts necessary to write the Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica. Problems will need to be solved or worked around. Other players' ideas will impede your progress. The player that contributes the most ideas to Newton's masterwork wins the game.&#10;&#10;Players begin the game with 30 ideas represented by wooden cubes in the player's color and six basic Think Cards. Players must use the limited number of cards they have to place and maneuver ideas on the board to form Concepts - various geometric shapes - that make up the Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematical. Players will need to manage their hand size and contents in an effort to obtain the most valuable Think Cards possible without exceeding their hand size. Think Cards played to manipulate ideas do not count towards the player's maximum hand size, but careful management and planning is required because the cards used by a player during their turn return to their hand over time in subsequent turns.&#10;&#10;",

That's what peasants are for...&#10;&#10;All the empires have sent their intrepid adventurers out to collect eggs, but not all will succeed! It gets crowded on Ridback Mountain, and there are only so many dragon eggs to go around &mdash; not to mention that the dragons have started mixing exploding eggs into their nests, and those hurt.&#10;&#10;In the fast-playing card game Eggs and Empires, players use matching decks of empire cards that contain adventurers numbered 1-10. Starting with a hand of three empire cards, each turn all players select one card from their hand, then play them simultaneously in an attempt to collect egg cards. Typically, the player who played the highest empire card chooses an egg first, then the player with the second highest empire card, and so on until all revealed eggs are collected, if possible. However, each empire card has a unique power that can affect the order in which eggs are selected. The powers interact in strategic and awesome ways so that every hand is exciting and fun!&#10;&#10;Outwit your opponents to collect as many good eggs as possible &mdash; that is, ones worth victory points (VPs) &mdash; while avoiding those nasty exploding eggs! Whoever collects the most VPs over three rounds wins.&#10;&#10;",

The one battle at a time, the two Skylanders across from each other do battle.  Both players roll their dice simultaneously, if their Skylander's symbol comes up, they win and collect the two Skylander cards.  A wild is considered a symbol, and the Kaos symbol is considered a loss.  Ties are re-rolled.  This is done for each Skylander.  The only exception is the Kaos Skylander, in which case you lose points if you collect them, so you hope they are taken by the other person instead.&#10;&#10;The player with the the most points (Skylander cards minus Kaos cards) wins.&#10;&#10;",

Income is gained by other players visiting their properties and money is spent when they visit properties belonging to other players. When times get tough, players may have to mortgage their properties to raise cash for fines, taxes and other misfortunes.&#10;&#10;Game play&#10;On his turn, a player rolls two dice and moves that number of spaces around the board. If the player lands on an as-yet-unowned property, he has the opportunity to buy it and add it to his portfolio or allow the bank to auction it to the highest bidder. If a player owns all the spaces within a color group, he may then build houses and hotels on these spaces, generating even more income from opponents who land there. If he lands on a property owned by another player, he must pay that player rent according to the value of the land and any buildings on it. There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes, collect income, or even go to jail.&#10;&#10;Goal&#10;The goal of the game is to be the last player remaining with any money.&#10;&#10;",

In order to fill the orders, you'll need to collect the ingredients for making the perfect burger for each customer that comes into the shop.&#10;&#10;There are four decks of ingredients: a red deck that includes beef patties and fried eggs, a yellow deck that includes chicken nuggets and french fries, a blue deck that includes pickles and cheese, and a green deck that includes tomatoes and onions.  All four decks also include buns.  You start the game with two food preparation areas and a card from each deck.  Three orders are turned up that can be filled.  A fourth order is turned up on top of the deck, this is a future order that will become available when one of the current orders is filled.  On your turn, you can play ingredients into your two food prep areas.  Then you place your worker token next to one of the four decks.  You draw two cards from that deck and place them under your token.  These cards can be taken when it is your turn again.  If someone also places their token next to the same deck, then you can take those cards at that time.  If at the end of your turn you have more than four cards in your hand, you have to trash ingredients until you are down to four cards.  Once cards are in the trash, you may also send your worker to get ingredients from the trash--with the added benefit that you get to choose which two cards from the trash you put under your token.  The game continues until one of the decks is exhausted.  Add up the total value of the orders each player has filled.  The player with the highest value wins.&#10;&#10;",

Each of these additional cells is called a Fortress and belongs to a player.&#10;&#10;Each player has three kinds of pieces in their own color: one General, four Officers, and seven Soldiers.  To begin the game, the General pieces are placed in the middle triangle of the first row adjoining that player's Fortress.  Filling out that row are the four Officers.  The next row inward has seven triangles and each are occupied by Soldiers.  These two rows are known as each player's Zone.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to move a General into an opponent's Fortress.  A cell may be occupied by only one piece at a time; players capture each other's pieces by landing on the same cell and removing the opponent's piece from the board.  Capture is not compulsory, and continuing moves after a capture is not permitted.  Movement of the pieces is through the sides of the triangular cells, not the points.&#10;&#10;A Soldier moves to one adjacent cell in any direction except backwards towards his home Fortress.  An Officer moves across two adjacent cells, unless there is a piece he wishes to capture in one adjacent cell.  After capturing, he must remain in that cell until the next turn.  While in their own Zone, Officers may not move back towards their own Fortress.  Once out of their Zone, Officers may move in any direction.  Generals move across one or two adjacent cells in any combination of directions, so long as they do not return to the same cell on the same turn.&#10;&#10;The first player to move his General into an opponent's Fortress wins the game.  Since it is possible for any piece to capture any other piece, it is possible that all three Generals could be captured and no player would win.&#10;&#10;",

By peddling influence, sending agents on strategic missions and carefully timing your secret plots you can sway these critical soldiers in the shadows and declare victory without dropping a single bomb.&#10;&#10;The Raccoon is at the Candy Shoppe challenges 3-6 players to deduce who is friend and who is foe. Use your table position to send your suspected enemies&rsquo; agents into danger or to control the outcome of an assignment. Will your carefully laid traps eliminate a dangerous spy or will your most trusted resource double cross you?&#10;&#10;Each turn you will send a spy out to a hotspot in the Cold War. When they arrive all spymasters will secretly spend tokens to influence the spy toward their goal or to twist the outcome of the mission. After all available spies have been placed players take turns revealing the tokens at each location and choosing how the mission will resolve. If your ideology has the most spies on your side at the end of the game, you win the Cold War!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Kastellet is a game for two, played on a hexagonal board comprised of sixty-one smaller hexagons, five to each side.  The central hex is referred to as the Point, and may not be played upon by either participant.  There is a unique neutral piece called the &ldquo;Roy&rdquo; which is used to mark the Point.  Each player has thirteen pieces in their own color, as follows: five Flag pieces, four Maces, three Lances, and one Bar.  Only one piece may be on a hex at a time; landing on an occupied hex is a capture, and the opponent's piece is removed from the game.  The object of the game is to continually &ldquo;cover&rdquo; the Point by always having at least one piece ready to move onto it.  Should a player lose his pieces covering the Point and not be able to move another piece into covering position on the next turn, he loses the game.&#10;&#10;The game begins with the players at opposite ends of the board, with a five hexagon side closest to them.  Their five Flags are placed on those closest five hexes, the player's back line.  Flags only move forward to one adjacent hex, toward the opponent's end of the board.  Should a Flag reach the center hex of the opponent's back line, on the next turn (if it has not since been captured) it can be exchanged for that player's Bar piece, which is held in reserve at the start of the game.  The Bar can be placed anywhere on the board, but will remain there for the rest of the game, unable to be moved or captured by either player.  No further moves are allowed for that turn.&#10;&#10;Maces begin the game two to a side on both ends of the players' Flags, extending around the rim of the board.  Maces may move to any adjacent hex, in any direction.&#10;&#10;Lances begin in the central three hexes of the third row of hexes inward from the players' back lines.  The movement of a Lance is through the points and lines of the adjacent hexes to one of up to six hexes just beyond.  The game's hexes may have three alternating colors so that the color-bound moves of the Lances are obvious.  Because of its position on the board and its style of movement, the central of the three Lances begins the game covering the Roy.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Foretold is a turn-based strategy game for 2-4 players. Play features Cards (Faithful, Fate Cards and Relics) and Tiles (Temple) acquired through a central Marketplace board. Games feature a period of economic build-up, preparation for combat, then Raiding and end-game. Players will align with one of four unique Fate Decks, boosting replay value and interaction. Craftiness, table politics and strategic play determine the winner. &#10; Overview:&#10;Players take on the role of an aspiring deity. They must build up a Temple, gather Faithful followers and collect powerful Relics in an attempt to wipe their opponents off the map &ndash; only one deity can reign eternal in this free-for-all of legendary proportions!&#10;&#10;Play Time: &#10;2 players (1-hour), 3 players (1.5 hours), 4 players (2-2.5 hours)&#10;&#10;Basic Play: &#10;&#10;    Play follows a 4-step turn: Reveal (start), Marketplace (buy), Raid (combat), Reinforce (end). &#10;    The Tile Deck, Faithful Deck and Relic Deck feed into a central board called the Marketplace. &#10;    Players use Faithful (human followers) in their Temple to collect gold and defend in combat. &#10;    Faithful placed in the Raiding Party can attack opposing Temples during combat. &#10;    Relics (4 of which are aligned to each Fate) further increase strategic play and add variety. &#10;    Players will purchase Tiles from a randomized stack (the Tile Deck) to customize their Temple, which is then arranged strategically to increase hand-size and defenses. &#10;    The four fates are: Chaos, Grace, Prosperity and Wisdom, each tailored to a unique play-style. &#10;    Each Fate Deck has a powerful set of 20 different cards, in theme with each of the Fates. &#10;&#10;&#10;Combat: &#10;A Raiding Party ventures into an opposing Temple, encountering Defenders and Traps along a Tile path  to the Heart of the Temple, where the opposing life force dwells. Combat is resolved through dice rolls, with Defense rolling first and combining its total. Faithful played from the Raiding Party must beat defending total or they are forced to retreat. If the Temple is conquered, damage is dealt through Smiting. When an opponent&rsquo;s life hits zero (20 max), they are defeated. The last remaining player has achieved immortality!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Kung Fu Fighting is a card game that simulates an all-out brawl between 2-6 kung fu masters! Players are dealt a hand of cards, which include attacks, attack enhancements, weapons, blocks, chi restoration (healing) and fighting stances. They take turns playing cards from their hands to attack other players with stylish moves like the dreaded &quot;Running up the Wall-Spinning-Flipping-Kick&quot;. A defending player can answer back with a block card, or counter attack with certain powerful cards. If an attack gets through, the defender loses chi (health). When a player runs out of chi, he is knocked out, and the battle continues until only one Kung Fu master &mdash; the True Master  &mdash; remains standing.&#10;&#10;This edition of Kung Fu Fighting combines elements of the original Kung Fu Fighting (2004) and its expansion More Kung Fu Fighting (2008) with new game mechanisms.&#10;&#10;",

S, K, W, N). Then, a category card is drawn from the deck and a die is thrown to determine the category (eg. &quot;at the playground&quot;). Players now turn the hourglass and write down all the words they can come up with that contain the chosen letters and match the category (eg. &quot;sand&quot;, &quot;swing&quot;, etc). When the time runs out, they score one point for each chosen letter they managed to use in their words; for example, &quot;swing&quot; would give 3 points for using S, W and N.&#10;&#10;Contents: 29 letter tiles, 50 category cards, hourglass, pyramid-shaped die, scoring sheets, rule book.&#10;&#10;Part of the Oppi&amp;Ilo playful learning series by Sanoma Pro Oy.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "A monopoly (from Greek monos &mu;&#207;&#140;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf; (alone or single) + polein &pi;&omega;&lambda;&epsilon;&#225;&#191;&#150;&nu; (to sell)) exists when a specific person or enterprise is the only supplier of a particular commodity.&#10;&#10;Monopoly is a roll-and-move game where players move around the game board buying or trading properties, developing their properties with houses and hotels. When opponents land on players owned property, the owning player collects rent from the landing player. Owning sets of properties increases the rent paid to the player who owns them, by the player who lands on the square. The ultimate goal is to have the most money and drive opponents into bankruptcy.&#10;&#10;The classic Monopoly with constructions and other elements from The National Gallery in the United Kingdom.&#10;&#10;From the publisher:&#10;The National Gallery houses one of the finest collections of European paintings in the world.&#10;Explore the gallery by starting with Thirteenth-Century paintings, journeying by way of Renaissance masterpieces by Leonardo and Raphael, and finishing with Post-Impressionist works Van Gogh and Rousseau.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "A Fistful of Kung Fu is a small scale miniature skirmish game based on A Song of Blades and Heroes and designed to recreate the action of Hong Kong action movies.&#10;&#10;Each player has a &quot;Protagonist&quot; and 5-14 &quot;Extras&quot; - which could be selected from the Police, Ninjas, Martial Artists, Yakusa, Triads and Tongs, Supernatural Creatures, animals, or Cyborgs lists provided in the book - or pretty much anything they can imagine.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn models are activated individually and dice for action points. For each success the model can take an action. For each failure the enemy protagonist has a chance to react. If two failures are rolled the player's turn ends and passes to the other player.&#10;&#10;From the publishers website:&#10;&#10;A Fistful of Kung Fu brings the hyper-kinetic, bullet-spraying, demon-slaying, kung-fu-fighting action of Hong Kong movies and Asian cinema to the wargames tabletop. In a modern world walking a precarious line between the advances of next-generation technology and the tradition and mysticism of ancient cultures, Kung Fu schools face off in no-holds-barred tournaments, corporations hire agents and spies to steal each other's secrets, overworked SWAT teams respond to gunfights between feuding Triad and Yakuza clans, and ancient artefacts are sought by hopping vampires, demon sorcerers and cyborgs alike. Combining the gunfights of John Woo&rsquo;s Hard Boiled, the hand-to-hand combat of Enter the Dragon, the sheer mystical weirdness of Big Trouble in Little China, the wuxia action of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, and everything in-between, A Fistful of Kung Fu is a skirmish wargame unlike any other&#10;&#10;",

Hens have become easy prey for the wild animals that roam the outskirts of the land. Each night the weasels and foxes sneak in to nab a nice dinner from the shelter of the chicken coop.&#10;&#10;Lately, the farmers have not been as diligent as they should when it comes to the safety of their broods. The roosters have decided to stop their cock fighting and stand up against the attacking beasts. They band together and wait for an attack from the vile creatures, hoping their numbers can fend off the nightly attacks. All is not completely safe for the hens however, as the farmers still like the taste of poultry in their meals&hellip;&#10;&#10;The Hen House is a fast paced card game for 2-8 players. Each player tries to defend their Hen House while trying to stop the other players from building up their brood.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "You are a Dreamwalker, lost in a mysterious labyrinth, and you must discover the oneiric doors before your dreamtime runs out &ndash; or you will remain trapped forever!&#10;&#10;You may wander through the chambers of dreams, hoping that chance will reveal the doors, or you can linger in each type of room. In both cases, you will have to deal with the slithering Nightmares, which haunt the hallways of the labyrinth.&#10;&#10;Onirim is a solo/cooperative card game. You (and a partner, if you wish) must work (together) against the game to gather the eight Door cards before the deck runs out; you can obtain those Door cards either by playing cards of the same color three turns in a row, or by discarding (under specific circumstances) one of your powerful Key cards. In both cases you will have to decide the best use of each card in your hand and carefully play around the Nightmares. Those cards are hidden in the deck and will trigger painful dilemmas when drawn...&#10;&#10;Seven mini-expansions, all standalone and compatible with one another, are included with the second edition of Onirim, including these three that were in the first edition of the game:&#10;&#10;&#10;    &quot;The Towers&quot; introduces a new type of card that allows more searching and deck manipulation, while also imposing an additional victory condition.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &quot;Happy Dreams and Dark Premonitions&quot; adds evil time bombs that will impede your progress at predictable moments of your quest as well as helpful but unreliable allies.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    In &quot;The Book of Steps Lost and Found&quot;, you must find the eight Door cards in a randomly given order and may remove discarded cards from the game to cast powerful spells that will help you complete this difficult task.&#10;&#10;&#10;In addition to these three variants from the first edition, there are four new modules in the Onirim 2nd edition box. Just like previously, each module consists of something that makes the game easier and something that makes the game harder:&#10;&#10;&#10;    &quot;The Glyphs&quot; introduces a fourth symbol on location cards (apart from Key, Sun and Moon), which makes it easier to compose the row of unrepeated symbols. Player must then find one extra door of each color (so 12 doors in total) to win&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &quot;The Dreamcatchers&quot; are four cards that &quot;guard&quot; the Limbo piles. The Limbo pile stays with Dreamcatcher until some effect allows the player to shuffle the pile back to the deck... if all Dreamcatchers are full and new cards should come to Limbo, a Dreamcatcher is discarded and his cards shuffled back. Also, four new &quot;Lost Dreams&quot; cards are supposed to be in Limbo at the end of the game, as an extra winning condition - so discarding all Dreamcatchers means loss.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &quot;The Crossroads and Dead Ends&quot; introduce location cards with a given symbol (3 Sun, 2 Moon, 1 Key), but serving as any color &quot;joker&quot;. It also contains 10 &quot;Dead End&quot; cards, that remain in players hand (un-discard-able on its own) and block her 5-cards hand limit... until a player discards the whole hand (=the only way to discard a Dead End).&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &quot;The Door To The Oniverse&quot; brings several one-time abilities cards as &quot;inhabitants of the Oniverse&quot;... and one extra colorless door to find.&#10;&#10;&#10;Apart from all those, there are a few special rules to use the dark meeple in the game (which interferes with Nightmare cards resolving), making the game easier or harder, depending on the chosen variant.&#10;&#10;",

Get it before it's cool.  It even has a pretentiously  hipster name, since it only includes one die.&#10;&#10;The rules are characteristically evasive but the gist is: there is a six-sided die. Each side of the die represents a category: music, drink, literature, fashion, movies, and food. One player rolls the die and has one minute to declare a factoid concerning the rolled subject. If everyone accepts the factoid as true, then play passes to the left. If someone challenges the factoid, then that player has two minutes to disprove the statement using whatever electronic device is handy. The winner in the challenge scores one point. The winner of the game is declared when that person scores five points. Players will have to provide their own score keeping units and electronic device for research.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Originally published by the Society of Ancients in 1969, this set of rules was a late development of the simple Bath/Featherstone system that held sway before the days of Wargames Research Group. It is widely considered to have been the ultimate in 'fun' rules of the time.  The final publication was in booklet form in 1984.&#10;&#10;These miniatures rules are semi-skirmish level rules allowing for combats in open field, around fortifications (sieges), or on shipboard (rivercraft or boats).&#10;&#10;Players create their own scenarios and victory conditions.  Gameplay follows the typical 1960s style of simultaneous action via written orders and combat resolution via die rolls and modifiers familiar to anyone who has played early Donald Featherstone or Tony Bath ancient and medieval rules.&#10;&#10;",

The spots on each side are the same, so that on one side the numbers run clockwise, the other anti-clockwise, which is indicated by an extra mark.&#10;&#10;The rules describe these games for play with Trilos:&#10;&#10;Dom Trilo &ndash; a game of drawing Trilos and matching them on a table, in an attempt to rid one's hand of any remaining tiles&#10;&#10;Stones and Windows &ndash; two players match randomly drawn Trilos around the blank edges of the small board (a triangular grid of 10 triangles the same size as the Trilos.)  The goal is to be the first to use all one's Trilos or, if reaching an unplayable position, to score the fewest points on remaining Trilos.&#10;&#10;Rummy Trilo &ndash; three players draw seven Trilos and privately try to match a pattern drawn in the rulebook, taking turns swapping out pieces until someone completes the pattern.&#10;&#10;Crazy Pavement &ndash; a more complicated version of Stones and Windows, with players trying to match pieces around the numbered sides of the small board, tracking several different ways to score points.  When the game becomes unplayable, the score determines the winner.&#10;&#10;Khuti &ndash; two players lay Trilos on the larger board (which features a grid of twenty-two triangles,) attempting to fill the board while outscoring each other.&#10;&#10;Khefren &ndash; two players engage in a slightly less difficult version of the above game, Khuti.&#10;&#10;Two Patience Games &ndash; there are two solitaire games included in the rules, Pyramid Patience and Trilex Patience.&#10;&#10;Troulette &ndash; a game of chance utilizing a scoring board drawn in the rules and the Trilos pieces.&#10;&#10;",

There are three long sides of the board, equivalent to six of the cell's sides in length, and three short sides, two cells in length.  The overall shape is of a triangle with it's points cut off, and the game's pieces (Stones) share this shape.  Half of the board's cells are recessed, and divided into three color groups: black for a triangular Field in the center of the board, and red, yellow, and green for each of the Camps in the corners of the board.  In each of the recessed Camp cells are a number of dots in one of these quantities: one, three, six, ten, and fifteen, with the smaller quantities being closer to the center of the board.&#10;&#10;Each player starts play with nine Stones of the same color as his Camp, placed in all the cells of his Camp.  The game is played only in the recessed cells of the board.  Players take turns moving their Stones one at a time in an attempt to move all the stones of their color into one or both of their opponents' Camps.  Stones may move to any one vacant adjacent cell (there are up to six adjacent recessed areas) per turn, so long as they do not re-enter their own Camp.  Stones may jump over one opponent's piece to an empty adjacent cell on the opposite side; stones are not removed from the board.  Jumps over friendly Stones are not allowed.&#10;&#10;The rules allow for final scores to be tallied based on the number of dots covered by each player in their opponent's Camps, and for alternate winning conditions.&#10;&#10;",

Games can be played using a timer or to a set number of points.&#10;&#10;Various field and ball designs have been used over the years, attempting to capture the realistic feel of soccer, while reducing bounce and the ball being ejected from the game.&#10;&#10;Skilled players can learn how to alter their shots between &quot;ground&quot; balls and volley shots.&#10;&#10;The game is light enough to be played on any elevated surface (such as a dining table or coffee table).

It is up to you to create shows that will attract the highest ratings and beat out your rivals. At the start of the game your schedule is a blank slate. You will have to program shows for Monday to Friday night. You do this by programming (playing) cards onto the table. These cards represent the shows, actors, commercial breaks and more. At the end of the game, whoever has the highest rated shows on each night will &ldquo;win&rdquo; that night. Each night is worth points. The player with the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;Cast the actors, come up with special twists and don&rsquo;t forget to program some commercials to pay for it all. What shows you create and when you program them are all up to you. Will you fight for the coveted Thursday night-time slot with a prestigious big budget show or try to tie up Monday and Tuesday nights with cheap programming? It&rsquo;s up to you to take your network to the top of the charts and be the leader of Prime Time.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Bloemeneiland - the Island of Flowers - is a game for 2 or 3 players who are flower buyers for the King. Players must buy flowers from the local merchants and growers and send them by ship back to the Palace to gain favor at court. The player with the most favor after six rounds is the winner.&#10;&#10;Playing the game:&#10;Beginning with the round&rsquo;s Starting Player, players take clockwise turns doing 2 actions in order.&#10;&#10;Action 1: Players must move the Island Marker on the board in a clockwise direction from one Townsperson space to another (or to the Dock). They may move any number of spaces but only the first space moved is free. Each additional space costs 1 gold. If the marker stops in front of a Townsperson that player will receive a benefit if they choose. If the player stops at the Dock they&#10;will cause all players to deliver flowers to the Ship.&#10;&#10;Action 2: After the player visits a Townsperson they must move their numbered Player Marker to a Location which matches the Townsperson&rsquo;s colored border. Locations occupied by another player may not be visited. You may then use the Location&rsquo;s Special Action. If the Island Marker is at the Dock, no Locations may be used.&#10;&#10;If the Island Marker is at the Dock, all players may now choose to deliver flowers to the Ship and gain Favor Points. Beginning with the round&rsquo;s Starting Player and then continuing clockwise, each player may deliver one type of flower to the ship, but never more than the Palace currently demands as valued by the dice in play. After each delivery, adjust the corresponding die down by the number of flowers delivered. Anyone who delivers flowers receives Favor Points equal to what is currently shown on the Favor Point track above the Ship.&#10;&#10;Game End: The game ends after the sixth Ship has sailed. In additional to the Favor Points earned during the game, each player receives an additional 1 Favor Point for every 3 flowers of each type they have in their possession. Gold is not worth any Favor Points. Whoever has collected the most Favor Points is the winner.&#10;&#10;This game is an express version inspired by Santiago de Cuba by Michael Rieneck.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The game is a turn based strategy game with economical macro game phase which includes:&#10; - Politics&#10;- Trade&#10;- Tech development &#10;- Building&#10;&#10;and Micro game phase with tactical squad based combat which includes:&#10;- Different soldier classes with skills trees&#10;- Custom vehicle &amp; troops loadout &#10;- Deep damage system for vehicles and troops &#10;- Meaningful troops moral and mental statuses&#10;- Weather conditions which influence on stats of vehicles and troops&#10;- Variety of mission types (Vip protection, convoy raids, hostage rescue, search and destroy etc .)&#10;- Permadeath of soldiers&#10;&#10;So here is a few words about game setting it's about post world war three, not very distant future with alternative history. World isn't in ruins (it's not a full post apocalypse but pretty messed up) but in a very bad state. Some terytories are in better shape, a rich ones of course live in a good cities with clean air water and ecologically clean food, poor people aren't so lucky they have to deal with desease, poor salaries raiders etc. Political map changed dramaticly some contries disappeared a new one emerged. The name of the game has a relation to the actual document of WWII between Germany and USSR the original text in ussr was kept in the special folder under number 34. The realtion is spiritual of course, it can give the mood of the uncertanty there is peace for now but for how long and at the same time war is continuing but on the different fronts in trade in politics and in actual &quot;undercarpet&quot; secret  combat by mercenary pmc.&#10;&#10;A few words about gameplay:&#10;&#10;Players control a group of mercenaries,who  is trying to survive in the world.After choosing a spawn region  players start roam the world map in turn base manner, trading, finding themselves in different random events,building their base and of course taking missions . Countries autonomously  act with each other,influencing the market  and  political situation(some political events can create a job oportunity with bigger challenge  and at the same time with bigger profits and reputation points). As for missions-There are many types of them they are played on a smaller maps with terrain also in the turn based manner(One of the things that we want to make is a very tactical game play where diceroll isn't a decisive thing but human skill is). All in all the game has more  of  rouge like feel  than a  classical wargame with particular objectives.  The process is the main fun part,but global goals also here(Player can get a citizenship of particular country and lead it to world  domination,take hold of the entire PMC market and be the one who pull the strings,also there are  some endings that are closely lore related).Also battle system can be used just for skirmishes.&#10;&#10;",

This instant classic is a re-imagining of the longer-to-brew hit game you've heard only whispers about from another tier of consciousness.&#10;&#10;&quot;Bob&quot;ball! is a game for two players. Try to save your mutant family and get them to the Pleasure Saucers before X-Day. Beware, there's only enough room for one more family. The other will be condemned to fry on Earth with the rest of the Normals.&#10;&#10;So pull the wool over your own eyes, grab some dice, and praise &quot;Bob&quot; or kill him. You've never seen balls like these.&#10;&#10;Use your &quot;Bob&quot;balls to bounce around along the grid to pick up family members and deliver them to the Pleasure Saucers. Each turn, roll three dice, assign the values to each &quot;Bob&quot;ball, and move. Make them hit your opponent's ball and transfer movement power to form chain reactions to keep them from scoring. Hitting another &quot;Bob&quot;ball stops yours and can transfer a family from one to another.&#10;&#10;",

This information takes the form of cards dealt at the beginning, known only to their owner.&#10;&#10;The game is played in turns, with each turn an auction.  The active player chooses one card to put up for bidding, and the highest bidder pays the bank and takes the card.  At the end of the game, the hidden cards are revealed and determine the worth of each purchased card, which the bank pays out.  The richest player is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

By playing cards to the free-form play area and then placing cubes on them to record their contributions, they hope to have their work be recognized by the Queen at story time.&#10;&#10;Scoring is similar to Acquire, where the person with the most cubes scores the normal value of a card, and the second-most gets half that value.  This scoring is triggered when someone plays a card with a low enough rank -- the more workers on a card, the more likely it'll get scored by a particular play.&#10;&#10;The number of workers you place each turn is based on the number of matching suits touched by the card you play.  This leads to natural clusters of suits, shaped implicitly by the opinionated nature of the deck.&#10;&#10;When the deck runs out, or a player runs out of workers, or a player reaches 100 points, the game ends with a final scoring round.  The player with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Individual games last from 15 minutes to 1 hour allowing for multiple exciting games in an evening's play.&#10;&#10;Patrol takes you beyond line &lsquo;em up and shoot &lsquo;em down miniature gaming. Opposing squads draw one of the 20 missions offering a large variety of tactical challenges that reflect historical tactics and weapon effects.&#10;&#10;Stats and weapons for American, Commonwealth, Soviet, German, Italian, Japanese, and Partisans forces are included. Additional appendix expands the game into the Korean War with new weapons and missions.&#10;&#10;Monstrous tanks, zooming jeeps with 30 cal blazing, flame throwers and mortars raining death, along with random battlefield events, create a chaotic and dangerous battlefield where a realistic morale system recreates the reactions of soldiers and their squad leader's attempts to motivate them.&#10;&#10;A complete campaign lets you keep the same squad over multiple games (if you can keep them alive). Survivors gain experience and skills, scrounge for weapons and gear, and try to get some sleep before drawing replacements and ammunition for the next patrol.&#10;&#10;",

But just one ship may not be enough, so you can fly through a wormhole to create two or even three ships to help you gather resources.&#10;&#10;You can make connections to gain more resources or hang around the local Riffraff. Send pirates, bounty hunters, or gangsters out to make areas rougher for your opponents, or enhance locations for everyone by sending out traders and courtesans.&#10;&#10;For every Trobil card you capture, you gain victory points. The player with the most points at the end wins&#10;&#10;",

Each player takes one tile at random to start the game. Then as quickly as possible, everyone picks up fruit tiles one by one and adds them to the stack already in their hand &mdash; but to add a tile, you must match the fruit half showing on the top (or bottom) of your stack with an identical fruit half on the tile being added. Thus, you're combining the fruit halves to create a whole fruit.&#10;&#10;Players can flip over tile on the table to see the reverse side. Once all the tiles have been claimed or no one wants any more, players compare their tile stacks and the players with the taller pile wins &mdash; but only if all the fruits have been combined correctly! If not, he loses and the player with the next tallest stack wins.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, a player calls either &quot;more&quot; or &quot;less&quot;, then flips the top card of the deck. Depending on what's called, players race to grab the items that correspond to the color and shape most (or least) visible on the card, scoring one point for each item correctly grabbed. If a magnifying glass appears on the card, players can grab anything they want. If the boss shows up, just grab him and score three points if you do.&#10;&#10;The number of points needed to win depends on the number of players.&#10;&#10;Attrapez-les tous !&#10;Les Gloobz sont d&rsquo;adorables cr&eacute;atures mais elles s&egrave;ment la pagaille partout o&ugrave; elles passent :&#10;rattrapez-les vite ! Selon l&rsquo;annonce du tour, saisissez les figurines dont la forme et la couleur sont les moins ou les plus repr&eacute;sent&eacute;es sur la carte en jeu. Chaque bonne figurine saisie vous fait marquer 1 point mais en cas d&rsquo;erreur, une p&eacute;nalit&eacute; vous attend. Et des cartes sp&eacute;ciales viennent se m&ecirc;ler &agrave; ce joyeux d&eacute;sordre. Ayez l&rsquo;esprit et le geste vifs pour attraper ces dr&ocirc;les de cr&eacute;atures avant vos adversaires! Points forts : mat&eacute;riel ludique, r&eacute;fl&eacute;chir vite, ambiance survolt&eacute;e.&#10;&#10;",

Japan vs. the Soviet Union, 1941&#10;&#10;Strike North presumes that Imperial Japan has decided to invade the Soviet Union in 1941, instead of going to war with the United States. Conceptually, a Japanese invasion of the Soviet Union would be in conjunction with the German attack on the USSR (Operation Barbarossa) on 22 June, 1941. The strategic possibilities of this alternative course are incredible; The Soviets will be under the pressure of fighting a two-front war. However, by following this strategy, the Japanese would be temporarily abandoning their planned invasions of the resource regions of the East Indies and beyond, leaving Japan less than a half-year of oil to sustain their war effort.&#10;The map shows Northeast Asia as it was in 1941, with each hex on the map equaling roughly 37 miles (60 kilometers) from side to opposite side. Each game turn represents one month of operations. The units are brigades, divisions and corps.&#10;&#10;Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 228 counters&#10;&#10;",

You will mix and match sentence fragments, balancing the story you want to tell about yourself against building a winning score&mdash;then read your creation aloud and hope a high score overshadows a potentially embarrassing or frightening self-portrait.&#10;&#10;The official goal is to produce a lineup of seven cards with the (absolute) greatest value, but most of a player's effort goes into putting together a story they'll be satisfied reading aloud to the group&mdash;and in the event of a tie or someone scoring exactly zero, the best story wins (by player voting).&#10;&#10;The story chunks on the cards contain elements of comedy, horror, working in an office, sexuality, religion, new-age mysticism, dreams, nightmares, and more, and are frequently only a sentence or a fragment of a sentence, so it's unusual for any single theme to dominate even a single player's hand. Some cards, or combinations of cards, are explicit in their depiction of sex and violence, which will either put players off the game or push them to create the wildest stories possible.&#10;&#10;",

Soldiers venture forth, battling centipedes while clashing with opposing colonies for territory. Workers dig an ever-expanding network of tunnels in their tireless search for food. The first larvae hatch and it is clear this generation will be different: the young colonies rapidly evolve into a multitude of new forms. The ants march out to claim the meadow as their own.&#10;&#10;In March of the Ants, you create the shared Meadow board by sending your ants to explore it, revealing and strategically placing two dozen unique tiles like Fern, Pebble, and Nest of Centipedes.&#10;&#10;Populate new territory by breeding larvae and marching your ants onto collection sites. Will you engage competing colonies in battle, seeking to claim the land for yourself? Or will you establish peaceful, symbiotic relationships and share the spoils? All of this must be done while carefully managing the resources in your underground nest.&#10;&#10;Forage for Event Cards like Strange Appetite, Cold Snap, and Fungal Outbreak to impact the entire board &ndash; or just one unlucky opponent.&#10;&#10;Mutate your colony with special Evolution Cards like the Trap Jaw head, Weaver thorax, and Leaf Cutter abdomen. What weird and wondrous path will your colony&rsquo;s evolution take: advanced Workers, fearsome Soldiers, or a fertile Queen?&#10;&#10;Emerge triumphant by scoring Colony Points as your ants explore and control the Meadow. Search for Colony Goals like Epic Stores, Followers of the Eyeless, and Extensive Tunnels to plan your route to victory.&#10;&#10;March of the Ants takes strategy underground&hellip;literally!&#10;&#10;",

You must work around the weather and the extinction of natural resources as well as negotiate deals to protect your wives while you decide between monotheism or polytheism. In this tableau-building game, you'll send your population out to hunt native species of Greenland &mdash; but some might not come back. (Historically, the climate turned frigid and all but the Thule (Inuit) died out.)&#10;&#10;In the game, play takes place over six phases; all players complete each phase in turn order, then the next phase starts. Each turn is one generation. In order:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Resolve events: Examples include elder deaths, animal migrations, feuds, or global cooling. If a trade ship arrives, an auction is held for its wares. &#10;     Assign hunters: Hunters are assigned to hunting grounds, resource gathering, colonizing the New World, raiding other tribes for wives or animals, or promotion to an elder.&#10;     Negotiate: Players can bribe others to peacefully withdraw hunters, including marrying them to their daughters. Players with a War Chief Elder can use hunters to attack others on the same card. The New World turns hostile if there are too many colonists.&#10;     Resolve hunting: Roll a die for each hunter and modify it for technologies and marriages. Success can result in gaining new hunters, resources, hand cards, wives, and/or technologies. Beware, as some animals can be confused by the prey-predator relationship and your hunters might not return. Some successes let your take cards from the central play area into your hand if within hand limit. &#10;     Maintain livestock: Pay to keep the animals you've already domesticated.&#10;     Take elder actions: Examples include invention, domestication, proselytization, and witch-burning. If you have no elders, you can convert to monotheism.&#10;&#10;&#10;Depending on each player's ending theistic worldview, he has a variable scoring based on successful hunts (polytheism) or resource gathering (monotheism).&#10;&#10;",

The game lasts four rounds (hands) with seven tricks in each round.  Each trick is represented by a tile (which can be positive or negative).  All of the tiles are known and in the order they will come out.&#10;&#10;A round consists of drafting your hand from all the available cards.  You can also get chips that count towards end game points in the drafting process.  After the draft, the hands are played out acquiring point tiles.  At the end of each round, player with the most tiles/tricks gets bonus points.  Also, you will be carrying over three cards into the next round.&#10;&#10;End of the game, more points are gained by being in the top three in the number of tricks, highest total on your three remaining cards and the number of chips gained from drafting.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Princess Emerald and her companions are questing deep into the Lordship Ruins to confront the evil that resides there. Brooding from his darkened hallways, the Forgotten King is a cursed lord who has pledged himself to the service of the Dark Consul, darkening his once lush and verdant lands. At his side are two new mini-bosses: Trent, a towering guardian of the forest with thick bark and brambles for armor, and Boris, a raging brute with snarling ursine features.&#10;&#10;In Super Dungeon Explore: Forgotten King, players explore the Fae Wood, home of the Kodama, sentient forest spirits with a taste for adventuring Heroes. Wisps lure Heroes into ensnaring traps as terrifying, man-eating plants sprout from the loamy forest floor to devour them. Continue into the Lordship Ruins where the once proud bramble knights, now corrupted and twisted into servants of the Dark Consul, stalk the stony ruins for any who would defile their lord's holdfast. Don't get too close to the trees, though, as we hear the squirrels are in an ill mood.&#10;&#10;Super Dungeon Explore: Forgotten King includes five new Heroes to brave the depths, including the Thundervale Huntress, Fae Alchemist, Royal Warden, and the brave Questing Knight. Each lend a new dynamic to gameplay and your strategy to conquer the Forgotten King and his minions.&#10;&#10;Forgotten King contains two play modes: Classic Mode, in which someone controls the dungeon and its monsters while everyone else takes the roles of the plucky heroes, or Arcade Mode, which allows for a fully co-operative game for up to five players.&#10;&#10;Forgotten King, while itself a standalone game, is compatible with all previously published Super Dungeon Explore expansions and supplements.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Nova Suecia - the Board Game&copy; is a board game about colonization, trade and survival in the New World. The players take on the role as governors of the Swedish colony Nova Suecia in the 17th century Delaware. They must cooperate to build a viable economy in the fragile colony since no player can control all parts on his or her own. The colonists need food, the colony needs money and the resources must be manufactured into tradable goods. The players must also, secretely, allocate common and own resources to the budget to prevent the colony from falling to internal and external threats. Each player must thus find a way to get the upper hand in this cooperative act of balance to emerge as a winner in the end. If they fail and the colony of Nova Suecia falls, all players lose!&#10;&#10;Game mechanisms include&#10;&#10;1. Player balance: The players grow by one district per turn and are thus always equally strong.&#10;2. Game balance: The game has a delicate balance between wealth, food and production. If one area grows on behalf of the others, the game will fall and so will the players.&#10;3. Bidding: All card drawings are followed by biddings where judgement rather than luck determines the outcome.&#10;4. Production &amp; Trade: The players build and develop the game together.&#10;5. Taxation: The players must secretly choose how much to pay for common expenses, thus introducing free-rider and prisoners' dilemma challenges&#10;6. Interdependence: The players must both cooperate and compete to survice.&#10;&#10;",

Each card has a saying [that needs to be said] and a gesture [that needs to be gested]. If your card doesn't match anyone else's, then your card goes to the center of the table. BUT, if your card does match another's, then you both must race to complete all the cards in the center of the table before you slap the BAM! card. Be the last to slap the BAM! and you get to add all the cards to your deck.&#10;&#10;",

The last remaining hope for restoring peace to Xidit lies with the Kingdom's noble heirs, the Idrakys. As one of them, you must roam the Kingdom recruiting brave soldiers and reclaiming threatened cities. Your bravery will not go unrewarded: accumulate wealth, send bards to sing your praises, and build Sorcerers' Guilds!&#10;&#10;Lords of Xidit features simultaneous programming and an elimination-based scoring system that leaves no room for complacency! In more detail, at the end of the game players compare their influence in one category and the player with the least influence is eliminated and his pieces removed from the board; players then compare influence in another category, with a player again being removed. The order of elimination is randomly determined at the start of play, forcing you to thinking in different ways each game.&#10;&#10;Prepare to ride out, Idrakys, and forge your legend!&#10;&#10;Note: Contained inside the box are 2 copies of a promo for other game: Seasons: Speedwall the Escaped&#10;&#10;",

With the restoration of Coldrum Manor ongoing, there has never been a better time to document its history, and it seems apt that it should be a Coldrum to relate the tale.&#10;&#10;Coldrum Manor, more commonly known as the derisory &ldquo;Redcap Manor&rdquo;, was built atop Mossdown Hill, a site long associated with spirits and faeries. Legend speaks of a series of standing stones that once stood near the hill, and Roman records of the area describe pagan rites involving human sacrifice. The strategic location of Mossdown Hill has long been recognised, and several strongholds have been constructed at this site over the last one thousand years.&#10;&#10;'Redcap Manor' draws from the most traditional tales of haunting in the British Isles, in which it was faeries, not ghosts, that kept people awake at night. In 'Redcap Manor', each player represents one of four Edwardian investigators sent to the titular mansion, to gather as much evidence for the uncanny as they can over three nights. To this end, the protagonists will use the recently-harnessed power of electromagnetism against the Fae.&#10;&#10;'Redcap Manor' is an auction/bluffing card game, divided into three turns representing the three nights of terror. Each turn, the players select a number of Haunt cards from their hand, to be secretly shuffled into the Haunt deck for the next night. Haunt cards are divided into three types: Fae, Presence, and Influence cards, each of which is countered by a different Ward card. Each player then places one of their three Ward cards face-down, and takes it in turns to uncover the top-most Haunt card. Eight cards are revealed per turn, representing eight hours before the dawn. After revealing a Haunt card, a player may choose to flee the Manor, but may not re-enter that night. The Haunt card remains face-up, and may be taken by subsequent players, together with any newly revealed cards. Alternatively, the player may take the Haunt card(s) - any Haunt cards countered by their Ward are taken as evidence (victory points); however, if the top-most card is not countered by their Ward, it is taken as a curse. Each Haunt card (24 unique cards, one for each hour of each night) has its own effect, influencing how the game is played. The player must determine whether taking a curse is worth the opportunity to acquire more evidence.&#10;&#10;At the end of the third night, the player with the most evidence points is the victor.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "From the Avalanche Press website:&#10;&#10;Without the formality of a declaration of war, in October 1935 Italian armies stormed into Ethiopia from both north and south. Badly outgunned and outnumbered, the Imperial Ethiopian Army resisted for six months before its final collapse. Italian forces deployed tanks, aircraft and poison gas against the Ethiopian levies, who fought back with suicidal courage and little else.&#10;&#10;Conquest of Ethiopia is a complete boxed game in the Panzer Grenadier series based on these battles. You do not need any other game to play any of its 40 scenarios. Design is by Lorenzo Striuli and Ottavio Ricchi, authors of our Fronte Russo supplement.&#10;&#10;The Italian invaders rely heavily on colonial troops, long-service professionals recruited in Eritrea, Somalia and Libya. They also have Blackshirts, Carabinieri, elite Alpini mountain troops, tanks and a great deal of air power. And the Italian advantages continue: motor transport, much more artillery and armored cars.&#10;&#10;Ethiopia&rsquo;s defenders include the elite Imperial Guard, and a number of regular battalions that are fairly good troops armed with modern weapons. Beyond that, things get a pretty bad for the Ethiopians pretty quickly. There are three distinct Ethiopian forces at play: the Imperial Regulars, the Imperial Levies (local forces loyal to the throne) and Provincial Levies (local forces loyal to their own leaders, usually a Ras or Duke). None of the levies are very well-armed.&#10;&#10;The game includes eight semi-rigid mapboards, with art by Guy Riessen. The maps are fully compatible with all others in the Panzer Grenadier series (and those from Panzer Grenadier (Modern) and Infantry Attacks, too). Plus 517 playing pieces: smooth, scorchless, sootless laser-cut pieces, a joy just to hold in your hands. And 40 scenarios.&#10;&#10;This game is sold only direct from Avalanche Press.&#10;&#10;",

The main goal of each player is to use game cards inspired by the world of archaeological science and collect so called scientific points.&#10;&#10;The first player who reaches the required amount of scientific points wins the game. Obtaining those points depends on the abilities of individual cards (and their combinations), that are used for construction of gaming decks. These cards are divided into five main card types. A player can play artecafts, archaeological sites, scientists, event cards and cards of so called written sources. Cards are also divided in unique and non-unique categories (unique means that you can play a card just once, non-unique cards can be played multiple times) and temporary (especially event cards) and permanent cards. Every player owns his or her own constructed deck, whose construction and the ability to defeat an opponent depends clearly on his or her combinational skill and his or her own inventiveness.&#10;During the game players draw cards from their decks and play them from their hands. They can play cards to support their gaming strategy or to disturb the opponent's game.&#10;&#10;The game primarily serves as an instrument of popularization and education in archaeology.&#10;&#10;",

Discard up to three cards and draw from the face down deck&#10;2.  Exchange up to three cards with the face up supply store&#10;3.  Play a special card&#10;4.  Play a fish card and try to catch it&#10;&#10;As well, as a free action, a player may swap or play a new lure.&#10;&#10;To catch a fish you must roll the die and match the die range for that fish type and the lure you are using.  Some lures work better for each type of fish.  Special cards can be used to steal fish from other players, break their rods or help you catch the biggest fish.  Be careful not to draw the hook card or you may need the first aid kit.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player has caught one of each type of fish.  To win, you must try to collect the most fish (2 points), the biggest single fish (2 points) and the total weight of your fish (1 point per pound).&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "What do you get when you mix Chaos, Cribbage, and Carnage?&#10;&#10;War Elephant Racing (W.E.R.) is a fast paced game of chance and skill. War elephants will be bumping and crashing into each other on a tight course sending the others into a spin that will cost them crucial game points. Players must carefully balance a number of objectives, be quick with reactions, and recognize all of the scoring combinations to be able to beat their opponent. It is a game where experience counts for a great deal although a little bit of luck always helps. New and young players will be able to jump in fairly quickly and give the vets a run for their money.&#10;&#10;War Elephant Racing uses Xhaos cards to spice up the race and increase the competitive action. Xhaos cards are special cards that call upon a special ability of an elephant of renown to give the players huge advantages to use against their competition. Special timing will provide the players with an edge over the other war elephant racers.&#10;&#10;War Elephant Racing is played closely to Cribbage, each player is dealt war elephant racing cards and then must take turns laying one card at a time from their hand to attempt to get pairs, runs, and target numbers to score points. Each point allows the player to move their elephant an equal amount of points. Once each player has played all of the cards from their hand they then take turns adding up the different combinations of &quot;points&quot; in their hand to move their elephants. Players move around the tight track for six laps.&#10;&#10;While players are moving their elephants if they land in a space that has another elephant they &quot;bump&quot; them. When a bump occurs the bump dice are rolled allowing the elephant to pass through, or send the bumped elephant in a spin, or send themselves in a spin costing valuable points.&#10;&#10;War Elephant Racing also has &quot;Xhaos&quot; cards which allow them to make ranged attacks, powerful bumps, throw spectators in the path, and more. The xhaos cards are a great fun edge that each player will have to help them win the race. Almost all of the xhaos cards are named after famous elephants in history, and their effect in the game is related to their fame.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Autumn, 1739. Fierce economic competition between Britain and Spain has broken into open war: the War of Jenkin&rsquo;s Ear.&#10;&#10;As His Britannic Majesty&rsquo;s naval commander-in-chief in the Caribbean, your duties have suddenly multiplied. Their Lordships at the Admiralty demand action. Parliament expects the speedy conquest of Spain&rsquo;s New World possessions &ndash; ALL of them &ndash;&nbsp;but is unwilling to supply men and ships. That would require the adoption of methods suitable only under a &lsquo;French Despotism&rsquo;. Before you utter them let it be known that your objections are unpatriotic and un-British. Meanwhile, the powerful Planters&rsquo; Lobby is insisting you make defending their islands your top priority, while the equally powerful Traders&lsquo; Lobby is demanding convoy protection and simultaneously accusing you of &lsquo;pressing&rsquo; merchant seamen into service aboard your ships.&#10; Or, can you honourably serve the great House of Bourbon, whose scions rule France and Spain? The English heretics have unjustly fabricated a war. They are jealous of Spain&rsquo;s greatness and desire her colonies for their own. For years they have paid lip service to the international laws of commerce while breaking those same laws at every opportunity. Of late, His Most Catholic Majesty had graciously agreed to accept arbitration for so-called &lsquo;wrongs&rsquo; done to British traders, waiving compensation for similar wrongs done to Spain. But when she offered payment, the English dogs slapped Spain&lsquo;s hand aside, saying it was not enough! This insult will not go unavenged. The King has ordered you to secure our trade routes and has issued letters of marque for the harrying of British merchantmen &ndash; let their own methods be used against them! In the fulness of time, our brother France has promised his support.&#10;&#10;Control the seas and you control the fate of the New World. Whichever side you choose, glory and honour &ndash; and prizes galore &ndash; are yours for the taking. Provided you avoid court martial and disgrace.&#10;&#10;Yellow Jack is a naval war game for two players, set during the years 1739-1743. It explores the roles of the navies of Britain, Spain, and France in the Caribbean. Scale is &ldquo;operational&rdquo; &ndash; that is, the playing pieces represent squadrons of as many as four ships, rather than individual men-o-war. Other counters represent leaders (good and bad), &ldquo;light&rdquo; forces such as frigates and galleys, and &ldquo;formations&rdquo; that allow you to concentrate your forces.&#10;&#10;Tactical themes are eschewed in favour of operational issues: keeping your forces in fighting trim, being at the right place at the right time, &amp; dealing with a mounting list of instructions, orders, and unfilfillable mandates from your Government. Combat, though abstracted, takes into account leadership, the class and condition of your ships, and of course the Weather Gauge. In an Age of Sail, wind and water conditions are critical, even at the &ldquo;operational&rdquo; level. Movement uses a point-to-point system where costs change with the wind and you will often be unable to go where you desire. Actions are &ldquo;simultaneous&rdquo;, but unlike many naval games, plotting is not required. Special features of Yellow Jack include the Hurricane Season, amphibious assaults and land campaigns, and the Yellow Jack itself &ndash; Yellow Fever.&#10;&#10;Time Required: 3 hours for a Minor Scenario; 1 weekend for the Campaign Game. As a bonus, there are also scenarios for 1744-1748, when the Caribbean struggle became submerged in the greater War of the Austrian Succession; these allow an Extended Campaign covering 1739-1748.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;6 die cut counter sheets &ndash; 720 counters &ndash; including the naval forces of Britain, Spain, and France, plus Pirates (no Caribbean naval game is complete without Pirates). One of the counter sheets includes all the important naval leaders who participated in the War of the Austrian Succession; another consists of land units &ndash; all the regiments that fought in the Caribbean. There is also a sheet of generic markers.&#10;&#10;37 wooden disks representing &ldquo;task forces&rdquo; (boxed game only; regular counters are also supplied to represent these items).&#10;48&rdquo; x 54&rdquo; map depicting the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, and Carolinas coastline.&#10;&#10;1 series rulebook, 1 exclusive rule book, 2 scenario/OOB books, 1 set of charts &amp; tables, historical commentary. 1 set of display cards.&#10;&#10;",

Thus, you need to observe the actions of others to figure out who you are. Another difference from traditional Werewolf games is that it requires no moderator and if your character dies, you can still participate in the discussion &mdash; and possibly even win!&#10;&#10;In the game, players are divided into two camps: Manlike and Werewolf. During the game, players accuse one another through confidential markers, which send others to death through family trial. When the number of surviving players drops to a predetermined threshold, which is based on the number of players, the camp with more survivors wins.&#10;&#10;",

Play takes place on a 3x5 board, where each square has one of five types of weather. Players take on the identity (and abilities) of one of the mad scientists.&#10;&#10;Players use their weather machines to move or create weather, with the aim of getting good weather to their side of the board or giving bad weather to their opponents. These can range from the humble remote control cloud to the gargantuan Noahmatic or the planetary realigner. Each machine can normally be used once per round, so the sequencing of play is important. At the end of each turn, sun and rain help gardens to grow, while heatwave and lightning cause them to wither and die.&#10;&#10;The final action of the game comes from the play of a 'taunt' card, which contains a special, hidden move and an associated threat to yell at your opponent.&#10;&#10;The player with the most flowers at the end of the game will be the winner.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Timeline: 60 ans de t&eacute;l&eacute;vision &agrave; la RTBF is a card game played using 110 cards. Each card depicts an event in the history of the Belgian television, with the year in which that event occurred on only one side. Players take turns placing a card from their hand in a row on the table. After placing the card, the player reveals the date on it. If the card was placed correctly with the date in chronological order with all other cards on the table, the card stays in place; otherwise the card is removed from play and the player takes another card from the deck.&#10;&#10;The first player to get rid of all his cards by placing them correctly wins. If multiple players go out in the same round, then everyone else is eliminated from play and each of those players are dealt one more card for another round of play. If only one player has no cards after a bonus round, he wins; otherwise play continues until a single player goes out.&#10;&#10;Timeline: 60 ans de t&eacute;l&eacute;vision &agrave; la RTBF can be combined with any other title in the Timeline series.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Card Hockey League is an ice hockey simulation game played with a standard deck of 52 cards.&#10;&#10;The two players take on the roles of team managers. The game is played over 3 rounds (periods). The players should ideally play facing each other and have access to a 6-card inverted pyramid game area.&#10;&#10;Each game area consists of 3 rows. The row closest to the player represents the goalkeeper. A single card is placed in this row. The second row holds two cards, representing defenders. The third, and final row, holds three cards, representing the forwards on the team. All cards are placed face up in a portrait orientation except the goalkeeper which is placed face down in a landscape orientation.&#10;&#10;The first player, determined in whatever fashion the players desire, shuffles the deck and secretly looks at the top card. He can choose to place this card in any open position in his own play area. Once placed, the card cannot be moved. Once all six spots are filled, the deck is passed to the opponent who fills his own six spots in like manner.&#10;&#10;Players take turns advancing on their opponent. Each turn begins with the player flipping over the top card of the deck and comparing it to his opponent's line of forwards. If the card matches or beats another card in value, both cards are discarded and the player is considered having advanced past that hockey player. If multiple cards meet the criteria, the player chooses which route to take.&#10;&#10;There is a strategic element when deciding which route to take when advancing on your opponent. With your first card, you compare against the three forwards. Once you have overcome a forward, your options for advancement may be limited. At no point are you allowed to skip another card in order to reach a more favorable card.&#10;&#10;Let's say that you use your first card to overtake the center forward with your first card &mdash; you now have clear line of sight to both remaining forwards and the two defenders, but the goal is still blocked. If, on the other hand, you advanced past the left side forward, only the center forward and left defender are &quot;open&quot; to you.&#10;&#10;Once the goal is &quot;open&quot;, you are free to attempt to score at any point. You simply announce that you will shoot instead of taking on a hockey player. Your card is compared to the value of the goalkeeper. If your card is [i]higher[/i] in value, you have scored a goal. Regardless, both cards are discarded as usual.&#10;&#10;Whether a goal is successfully scored or not, it is now your opponents turn. Play also switches if you fail to successfully overtake enough players to clear an open path to your opponent's goal.&#10;&#10;Your opponent will begin his turn by first filling any open spots as was done when the game began. He then takes his turn as normal.&#10;&#10;Special Rule: When only one card is left in the deck, a player may, on his turn, assuming his team slots are filled, attempt a shot on goal regardless of whether an open path exists or not.&#10;&#10;Once the deck is exhausted, the period is considered having ended. All cards are gathered up, play switches to the next player who shuffles and drafts his team as was done at the beginning of the game.&#10;&#10;Once three periods have been played, the player with the most goals is declared the winner. There are no rules for breaking ties.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "&quot;Are you joking?&quot; is an educational game for English learners. It consists of two type of cards. One type has tongue twisters, jokes, quotes and such; the other type contains words (in English and German). One player reads one card of the first type, then counts from 10 to 0. The other players check whether they hold word cards with words that are included in the text. If so, they can discard them in front of themselves and draw new cards. Players who manage not to laugh during the countdown get an extra card; if everyone laughs, the reader gets it. &#10;After a certain number of rounds, the player with most points on his/her cards is the winner. &#10;There are some advanced rules included, for example demanding a certain reading style.&#10;&#10;",

You will be amazed about what you will find out about your friends.&#10;&#10;It's a simple and fun adult card game that is different every time you play, as different groups will respond in different ways. You will find out more about your friends or new people at a party. You will be amazed and surprised about the answers you get to intimate, probing questions. We are sure you will be surprised about what you learn about your friends.&#10;&#10;In its simplistic form, a dealer reads a question from the deck and you anonymously answer 'Yes' or 'No'. The dealer tries to guess how many answered 'Yes' or 'No', and if they guess correctly, they keep the question card. If not the dealer decides which stories they want to hear why people answered 'Yes' or 'No'. If the dealer wants to hear the 'Yes' stories and you as a player answered yes, you can choose to tell the story to win the card, or keep quiet and remain anonymous. If there are more than one 'Yes' cards, then multiple people can tell their stories and the dealer decides which story wins. At the end of the game, the player who has gathered the most cards wins the game.&#10;&#10;The great thing about this game is that you have the freedom to choose to remain anonymous or to share the stories behind your answer - so you decide on what to divulge to the group you&rsquo;re playing with, it allows you to freely express something in public without the repercussions.&#10;&#10;The game provides the environment to share stories and situations and engage in conversations that you would not normally engage in. You will be amazed what you find out about your friends. Is an adult game(18+), so as you can imagine there are some pretty risque questions.&#10;&#10;Here are a couple of 'tame' sample questions in the deck:&#10;&#10;Have you ever had a DUI?&#10;Have you ever been arrested?&#10;Have you ever lied on a tax return?&#10;&#10;",

To reach The Zone, you must navigate the terrain and capture or circumvent enemy tanks. To capture a tank, move your tank into the space it occupies.&#10;&#10;Each space on the board features one of four types of terrain, either dirt, grass, hill, or mud. Each space gives you a different combination of attack and movement range when you move from that space. You can get stuck in the mud with a movement of zero, or blast down a hill with a movement of 2! Your attack range is consistently 1, except for when you have the high vantage point of the hill space.&#10;&#10;This has the feel of a classic strategy game like Othello or Stratego. It's very simple to learn but hard to master. Understanding the terrain and effectively positioning your forces will be the key to your success. Pretty simple, right? Then get moving, Commander!&#10;&#10;",

You will be going back to the Communist era during the winter of 1983 to fight for ration cards for meat, sugar and other goods. Your goal is to buy the goods on your shopping list before your guests arrive.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, the goods in stores are rationed, and the number and kind of ration cards distributed rarely corresponds with what you need. Instead those cards might land in the hands of other players. You soon realize that success depends on how clever and smooth you are in exchanging ration cards with players standing in the same queue &mdash; but you need to hurry as the clerk will finish her tea in just one minute and start selling the goods.&#10;&#10;As with all IPN publications, Reglamentacja: Gra na Kartki was created as an educational tool to remind the world of why the Communist economy fell. The richly illustrated booklet includes a historic overview of the last decade of Communism in Poland and the principles of distribution of controlled goods.&#10;&#10;",

Finding food, building a shelter, resisting floods and mostly avoiding being poisoned by unhappy neighbors: such is the price of freedom!&#10;&#10;Ragondins (French for &quot;coypus&quot;, a.k.a. river rats) is a trick-taking game. Each round, each player in turn places a card from his hand on top of the first player's card, playing the same color card if possible. Whoever places the highest valued card of this color wins the trick and plays again. The food cards are positive and the shelters protect the food; the flood cards are negative and wash away first the shelters, then the food, from a player's collected cards. Some food is poisoned and costs you points, so try not to grab that! Whoever has the highest score after seven rounds wins.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "A fast, trick taking game of medieval village politics!&#10;&#10;Life in a medieval village can be very political. On one side you have the Mayor - respected, powerful, able to affect real change. On the other side you have the Village Idiot.&#10;&#10;Challenge other players to a battle of skill and luck. Add to the rules of the game as you seize power but beware! No one is above the law. Claw your way to the top and do your best to stay there in this fast, fun, trick taking game with a twist! Village Idiot plays in less than an hour for 3-10 people. You'll be jumping right out of your seat!&#10;&#10;Based on several classic party games, Village Idiot combines trick taking, rules making and six rounds of play with every round progressively changing as players build upon the basic rules.&#10;&#10;Objective: Become the mayor of your small, medieval village.&#10;&#10;Game Play: The entire deck is dealt out to all of the players. The deck consists of numbered cards from 2 - 15. Several cards have special abilities or act as wild cards.&#10;&#10;In round one, whoever has the Start card (a 4) begins play. Each player must then play one or two cards of a higher number. Play continues clockwise. The first player to discard all of their cards becomes the Mayor and scores 5 points. The second becomes the Councilor and scores 4 points, and so on.&#10;&#10;The last player with cards in their hand becomes the Village Idiot.&#10;&#10;Players then rearrange their seating So that play begins with the Mayor, proceeds to the Councilor and so on. The player who has become the Mayor then gets to add one rule to the game, which must be followed until the game ends. Any player who does not follow this rule finds themselves drawing more cards rather than playing them.&#10;&#10;The game continues for six rounds, with seating changing and new rules entering play. At the end of the sixth round, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Easy to learn as all of the rules fit on two standard, poker sized cards. Village Idiot can be played with family or friends and be as fun or as cutthroat as you want it to be!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Kombat Kittens Game Rules&#10;&#10;THE GOAL&#10;Collect the most treasure by battling your kitten compadres and taking their treasure. At the end of the game, the player with the most treasure wins!&#10; THE DECK&#10;80 Kitten Cards: Ten each of ranks 1-7 and ten of rank 9 (There is no rank 8 in Kombat Kittens.) Each card has treasure value from 1 to 4.&#10;Five Dog Cards: Each Dog card has a treasure value of 5. Dogs do not have a rank.&#10;&#10;SETUP&#10;Remove all Dog cards from the deck and deal each player five Kitten cards.&#10; For two players: Deal out three Kitten cards face up in the center of the table - these are the Recruit cards. Add three Dog cards to the remaining deck, each &#226;&#133;&#147; of the way through the deck, with the last on the bottom. This is the Draw pile. Place it in the center of the table.&#10; For three to five Players: Deal out one Kitten card face up in the center of the table - this is the Recruit card. Add two Dog cards to the remaining deck, one at the center, and one on the bottom. This is the Draw pile. Place it in the center of the table.&#10; The player with the most realistic &ldquo;meow&rdquo; goes first.&#10;&#10;TAKING TURNS&#10;On each turn, the player can either:&#10;1) Draw a card from the Draw pile. (If they have less than seven cards in their hand.)&#10;or&#10;2) Take a Recruit card and replace it with a card from their hand.&#10;or&#10;3) Battle another player: do this by declaring which player you wish to battle.&#10; We recommend passing a turn token (coin, salt shaker, stuffed mouse, etc.) around the table as you play this game. It is always okay to ask how many cards another player has.&#10;&#10;Battles&#10;In a battle, both players attempt to make the best three card set from the cards in their hand.  &#10; To indicate they are ready to battle, each player holds their first card face down over the table. When both players are ready, they reveal their cards simultaneously. They repeat this process until three cards have been played (unless a player forfeits, as described below.) After the third card, the best hand is determined and the winner chooses their treasure (see below).&#10;&#10;DETERMINING THE WINNER OF A BATTLE&#10;The winner is the player with the best hand based on the hierarchy below, from high to low. If two hands of the same type are played, the one with the highest rank wins.&#10;Three of a Kind: Three cards of the same rank. Example: 4,4,4 beats 2,2,2 and all straights, pairs and high card hands.&#10;Three Card Straight: Three cards of adjacent rank. Example: 4,5,6 beats 2,3,4 and all pairs and high card hands.&#10;Pair: Two cards of matching rank, plus one other card. For matching pairs, the one with the highest 3rd card wins. Example: 6,6,5 beats 6,6,3 or 4,4,7 and any high card hand.&#10;High Card Hand: A hand without a straight and no pairs. Example: 7,4,3 beats 6,5,2.&#10;&#10;TIES&#10;If there is a tie, all players involved in the tied battle discard the played cards and take the number of cards they played from the draw pile instead of drawing up to five cards. No treasure is taken in a tied battle.&#10;&#10;CAPTURING TREASURE&#10;At the end of battle, the winning player captures Treasure from the losing player(s) as follows:&#10; Three to Five Player Game: The winner may now take either one card from the losing player&rsquo;s played cards or the lowest value treasure from the losing player&rsquo;s captured treasure. If there are multiple lowest value cards, the winner chooses whichever of these they want.&#10; Two Player Game: The winner takes one of the loser&rsquo;s played cards - they cannot take captured treasure.&#10;&#10;AFTER A BATTLE&#10;Once battle is resolved, all uncaptured cards that were played are put into a discard pile, which we call the Litter Box. Then,  all players who participated who have fewer than five cards left, draw new cards until they have a total of five in their hand.&#10; All captured cards are placed face up in front of the player who captured them, so that their treasure value and suit are visible to all. Additionally, if a player forfeited (see below), they draw an extra card now. If a battle ended in a tie, then each of the players in the battle (primary and helper) draw the number of cards they played (three or one).&#10;&#10;HELPING&#10;Once a battle has been announced, but before the first card is played, each player involved in the battle may ask for help. If Player B agrees to help Player A, then Player B will play a single card at the end of the battle, after Player A has played their three cards. In a four or five person game, each side in a battle may ask for and receive help. If both sides have a helper, then each helper reveals their card simultaneously after the two main combatants have shown all three cards.&#10;&#10;After all cards are played, each side makes their best three card hand out of the four cards available.&#10;&#10;Taking treasure: In a helper battle, two cards are taken from the loser. The main combatant on the winning side chooses one card from the played cards (all four cards, if the losing side had a helper) and one card from the main losing combatant&rsquo;s captured treasure. If the main combatant on the losing side has no captured treasure, then the winning side takes two cards from the cards played. Once they&rsquo;ve taken treasure, the winner can choose to give one of those cards to the player who helped them.&#10; Example: Kim announces she will battle Josh. Josh and Kim both ask for help. Mike agrees to help Kim, and Vivian agrees to help Josh. Kim and Josh then simultaneously reveal three cards from their hand in sequence. Mike and Vivian then both reveal a card from their hand. Kim&rsquo;s side ends up with 5,5,5,7 and Josh&rsquo;s side ends with 4,5,6,7. Kim&rsquo;s side wins, because she has three 5&rsquo;s which beats Josh&rsquo;s hand of 5,6,7.&#10; Kim then takes one card from Josh&rsquo;s captured treasure, and one of the four cards played (one of the 4,5, 6 or 7).  Although she could add both cards to her own treasure, she gives Mike one of the two as a reward for helping her.&#10;&#10;FORFEITING&#10;Either of the main combatants in a battle may forfeit after playing their first or second card. Players who are receiving help can forfeit as well, but even if they do, the helper must play a card. Cards played by the forfeiting player or their helper are subject to being taken by the winner, just as in any other battle.&#10; If a player forfeits, they are allowed to take an additional card from the Draw Pile after the battle. If they are left with fewer than five cards at the end of battle, they first draw until they have five cards then take their additional card. Helpers on the forfeiting side may not take an additional card. They only take new cards if they have less than five in their hand at the end of battle.&#10;&#10;DOGFIGHTS&#10;If at any point during play a player draws a Dog card from the deck, they immediately place it face up in the center of the table and a Dogfight commences. (Before the Dogfight, the player who drew the Dog draws a new card and any other players who were in mid-draw should finish drawing.)&#10; Players must play at least one card in the Dogfight, but they may forfeit after playing their first or second card. The winner of the Dogfight takes the Dog card and places it face up in front of them in their captured treasure. As in normal battle, all players select a card and hold it face down over the table, then reveal their cards at once. Unlike a normal battle, players may not ask for help.&#10; The Dogfight ends when either a) all players but one have forfeited, or b) all players who are still in the Dogfight have played three cards. In the case of Ties, the Dog is discarded, and all players who played three cards take three cards from the draw pile.&#10; As with normal battle, any players who forfeit the Dogfight battle draw an extra card at the end of the battle and all players who have fewer than five cards draw until they have five.&#10;&#10;REACHING THE END OF THE DECK&#10;Two Players: At the end of the first deck, there will be a single Dogfight (the bottom card is always a Dog) and then the game is over.&#10; Three to Five Players: At the end of the first deck, after the Dogfight, take all the discarded cards from the Litter Box and reshuffle them. Then add the last three Dogs to this deck, each card roughly &#226;&#133;&#147; of the way through the deck with the last Dog on the bottom of the deck. When you reach the end of the second deck there will be one final Dogfight and then the game is over.&#10;&#10;END OF THE GAME&#10;Two players: The game ends after the Dogfight at the end of the first deck.&#10;Three to Five players: The game ends after the Dogfight at the end of the second deck.&#10; Note: If any player has fewer than five cards or needs to draw cards due to a previous battle, then shuffle the discards from the Litter Box and draw cards before the final Dogfight.&#10;&#10;DETERMINING A WINNER&#10;At the end of the game, each player adds up the treasure value of all cards in their captured treasure (the ones face up in front of them) and adds any Suit Bonuses (as described below). The player with the highest total wins! They should be patted on the head and given a treat.&#10;&#10;SUIT BONUSES&#10;A player who has four or more treasure cards of the same suit receives a 10 point bonus at the end of the game. Players receive this bonus once per suit of which they have four or more cards.&#10; Example: If a player has four captured Samurai kittens, they get 10 bonus points. If they have eight captured Samurai, they still get just 10 bonus points. However, if they have four captured Samurai and four captured Mechs, they get a 20 point bonus (10 for each suit).&#10; If two or more players tie for the the highest treasure score, the tied players play a three-card hand after first drawing to make sure have at least five cards in their hands. The player with the best hand is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Each player equips fleets with escort ships and upgrades and uses them to control star systems for VPs. Diplomatic leverage, cunning, and brute force will determine the victor.&#10;&#10;Each round in Fleets: The Pleiad Conflict consists of six phases:&#10;&#10;1) Player order. Every round has a new randomized player order. Being first has its pros and cons, so does being last.&#10;&#10;2) Build. The players take turn buying new fleets, escort ships, and upgrades, using their megacredits. The fleets each consist of a flagship and space for some combinations of escort ships and upgrade cards. Which fleet you choose and how you develop it will determine its strengths and weaknesses.&#10;&#10;3) Deployment. The players place their fleets at the different systems they want to control.&#10;&#10;4) Diplomacy. Players take turns using diplomatic actions. There are 2 basic actions: A) Use 2 diplomatic points to retreat your fleet from the board. B) Use 6 diplomatic points to retreat an opposing fleet from a system where you have a fleet. There are also diplomatic actions on some fleets, systems, and action cards.&#10;&#10;5) Battle. At every system with more than one fleet there will be a battle where every ship gets to shoot once. Each fleet has different initiative numbers for its ships, describing when they get to act. Late ships risk being shot down before they have a chance to fire. During battle, players can also use battle actions on action cards, upgrade cards, fleets, and escort ships. Most battle actions cost energy from the fleet. If a flagship is destroyed, its owner must immediately retreat all surviving escort ships from that battle and discard the fleet.&#10;&#10;6) Reward. Players get 1 VP for each system they have to themselves (The first player to reach 7 VP is the winner.). Then each fleet gets energy from its reactor and resources from the system where they are located. Then each player gets 2 diplomatic points, 6 megacredits, and an action card, and then the next round can begin.&#10;&#10;",

Collect the most and best characters (properties), and earn the most fuel (money) to win.&#10;&#10;The board is 7 x 7, with 4 characters (properties) per side, two per color, plus the standard Go, Free Parking, Go to Jail and Jail corners, and finally 2 &quot;Race Challenges&quot; and 2 &quot;Prize Fund&quot; locations (where the railroads would be, but correspond to the Community Chest or Chance cards in the original game). Race Challenges will often have you contribute money to the Prize Fund, which then goes to the next person who lands on those locations.&#10;&#10;When the game begins, each location has a corresponding card placed on it. As each player lands on those locations and &quot;buys&quot; them, they take the card and mark the location on the board with one of their 10 hangars (houses/hotels, sort of, but that simply mark ownership of locations on the board). Then like in classic Monopoly, other players must pay the fuel cost for that location if they land there.&#10;&#10;Variants on the basic game allow for monopoly pricing, scoring per the fuel cost on each card (property) instead of simply 1 point per card, and card (property) swaps.&#10;&#10;",

In addition to the standard property acquisition and collecting payment from opponents, players can fight monsters and develop their characters. Getting on certain cells of the field, players can start a battle with monsters and get treasures, which will improve their fighting skills.  The measure of fighting abilities is the level. Clashes between players are also possible: 2 players need just to be on the same sector. A mechanism of a fight is simple: the opponents roll a D6, add the number to their level value (that can be improved with artifacts) and the highest sum is the winner! In case of a defeat players don't die. The worst that can happen is the loss of a certain amount of money. Most powerful artifacts the player can receive for the victory over the dragon help you to make your rivals go broke, but do not play a critical role: if someone is doing bad he goes bankrupt anyway and prosperous player can afford to lose a couple of hundred.&#10;&#10;",

But the story of the game is more satirical than actually criminal. The game is worth buying at least for the illustrations on the cards: very vividly depicted representatives of the Russian criminal world.&#10;Also the cards have classical card suits on them. So you can play classical card games with one of the decks, if you want to.&#10;&#10;The game consists of two decks - fighters and property. Each card has a toughness value. If the toughness of the fighter is higher than the toughness of the property, he can capture it and become it's guard. The owner of that fighter becomes the owner of the property. Another player can try to seize neutral property or someone else's property by attacking the guard. All fighter cards have different special abilities on them. At the beginning of the game players assign trumps. And during the game only the trump suit can use card abilities. When at some point of the game any player possesses a curtain amount of property he is declared the winner and the game ends.&#10;&#10;&#208;&#160;&#209;&#131;&#209;&#129;&#209;&#129;&#208;&#186;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#181; &#208;&#190;&#208;&#191;&#208;&#184;&#209;&#129;&#208;&#176;&#208;&#189;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#181;:&#10;&laquo;&#208;&#145;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#187;&#209;&#140;&#209;&#136;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#185; &#208;&#186;&#209;&#131;&#209;&#136;&raquo; &mdash; &#209;&#141;&#209;&#130;&#208;&#190; &#208;&#184;&#208;&#179;&#209;&#128;&#208;&#176; &#208;&#191;&#209;&#128;&#208;&#190; &#209;&#128;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#185;&#208;&#180;&#208;&#181;&#209;&#128;&#209;&#129;&#208;&#186;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#181; &#208;&#183;&#208;&#176;&#209;&#133;&#208;&#178;&#208;&#176;&#209;&#130;&#209;&#139; 90-&#209;&#133;, &#208;&#186;&#208;&#190;&#209;&#130;&#208;&#190;&#209;&#128;&#208;&#176;&#209;&#143; &#208;&#178;&#209;&#139;&#208;&#191;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#187;&#208;&#189;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#189;&#208;&#176; &#208;&#178; &#208;&#191;&#208;&#190;&#209;&#130;&#209;&#128;&#209;&#143;&#209;&#129;&#208;&#176;&#209;&#142;&#209;&#137;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#188; &laquo;&#208;&#177;&#208;&#187;&#208;&#176;&#209;&#130;&#208;&#189;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#188;&raquo; &#208;&#176;&#208;&#189;&#209;&#130;&#209;&#131;&#209;&#128;&#208;&#176;&#208;&#182;&#208;&#181; &#208;&#184; &#209;&#129; &#208;&#178;&#208;&#181;&#209;&#129;&#209;&#140;&#208;&#188;&#208;&#176; &#209;&#131;&#208;&#183;&#208;&#189;&#208;&#176;&#208;&#178;&#208;&#176;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#188;&#209;&#139;&#208;&#188;&#208;&#184; &#208;&#191;&#208;&#181;&#209;&#128;&#209;&#129;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#189;&#208;&#176;&#208;&#182;&#208;&#176;&#208;&#188;&#208;&#184;. &#208;&#161;&#209;&#130;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#187;&#209;&#140; &#208;&#184;&#208;&#179;&#209;&#128;&#209;&#139;, &#209;&#129;&#208;&#186;&#208;&#190;&#209;&#128;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#181;, &#209;&#129;&#208;&#176;&#209;&#130;&#208;&#184;&#209;&#128;&#208;&#184;&#209;&#135;&#208;&#181;&#209;&#129;&#208;&#186;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#185;, &#208;&#189;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#182;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#187;&#208;&#184; &#209;&#128;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#176;&#208;&#187;&#209;&#140;&#208;&#189;&#208;&#190; &#208;&#186;&#209;&#128;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#188;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#189;&#208;&#176;&#208;&#187;&#209;&#140;&#208;&#189;&#209;&#139;&#208;&#185;. &#208;&#149;&#209;&#145; &#209;&#129;&#209;&#130;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#184;&#209;&#130; &#208;&#186;&#209;&#131;&#208;&#191;&#208;&#184;&#209;&#130;&#209;&#140; &#209;&#133;&#208;&#190;&#209;&#130;&#209;&#143; &#208;&#177;&#209;&#139; &#209;&#128;&#208;&#176;&#208;&#180;&#208;&#184; &#208;&#184;&#208;&#187;&#208;&#187;&#209;&#142;&#209;&#129;&#209;&#130;&#209;&#128;&#208;&#176;&#209;&#134;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#185; &#208;&#189;&#208;&#176; &#208;&#186;&#208;&#176;&#209;&#128;&#209;&#130;&#208;&#176;&#209;&#133;: &#209;&#129;&#209;&#130;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#187;&#209;&#140; &#208;&#186;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#187;&#208;&#190;&#209;&#128;&#208;&#184;&#209;&#130;&#208;&#189;&#208;&#190; &#208;&#184;&#208;&#183;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#177;&#209;&#128;&#208;&#176;&#208;&#182;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#189;&#209;&#139; &#208;&#191;&#209;&#128;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#180;&#209;&#129;&#209;&#130;&#208;&#176;&#208;&#178;&#208;&#184;&#209;&#130;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#187;&#208;&#184; &#208;&#190;&#209;&#130;&#208;&#181;&#209;&#135;&#208;&#181;&#209;&#129;&#209;&#130;&#208;&#178;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#189;&#208;&#189;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#179;&#208;&#190; &#208;&#186;&#209;&#128;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#188;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#189;&#208;&#176;&#208;&#187;&#209;&#140;&#208;&#189;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#179;&#208;&#190; &#208;&#188;&#208;&#184;&#209;&#128;&#208;&#176;.&#10;&#10;",

Even as you lead your bravest warriors into battle, you must plan for the future, establishing a presence on planets before the tides of war consume them in blood and fire. You must conquer the Traxis sector by strength of arms for in the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war.&#10;&#10;Warhammer 40,000: Conquest introduces seven distinct factions: Space Marines, Astra Militarum, Orks, Chaos, Dark Eldar, Eldar, and Tau. Each of these factions possesses a unique flavor and style of play, and an alignment wheel introduces the possibility of forming an alliance between two factions.&#10;&#10;At the start of play, the Traxis sector lies open before you, with planets awaiting the tramp of armies on the road to war. Each round begins with you and your opponent preparing for battle. Planet cards are arranged in a row between the players at the beginning of the game, and the planet farthest to the left of the starting player is the first planet. Each round, you or your opponent will clash at the first planet, and the victor will capture the first planet.&#10;&#10;Capturing planets is your ultimate goal. Some planets possess essential materials necessary for the armies of the 41st millennium. Others offer strategic advantages to those who hold them, while yet others are home to great technological wealth. Each of the planet cards possesses one or more symbols in the upper left hand corner, designating that planet's assets. These symbols grant no abilities by themselves, but the first player to collect three planets sharing a common symbol dominates the sector and wins the game.&#10;&#10;Your warlord grants powerful special abilities, determines your starting resources and hand size, and serves as a vital part of your army, so you'll want to build your deck around your warlord to take full advantage of his strengths &mdash; and cover his weaknesses, as defeating the opponent's warlord is another way to victory.&#10;&#10;",

Players need to combine cards to hit and slay the monsters before they destroy the castle. The card combos available in Munchkin Panic are created from a unique mixing of the decks of the two source games. Each defeated monster becomes a trophy and gives up its treasure to the victor. If players work together to defeat the monsters, the player with the highest point count becomes Master Munchkin &mdash; but players must balance their self-interest with the cooperation necessary to survive. If players get too greedy, the monsters will stomp the castle flat while the players are too busy fighting amongst themselves!&#10;&#10;",

On each of the tiles, there is one character: A dragon, a knight, a king, a princess and a horse. The active player rolls a die. If the result is a number, the player moves any character forward by that number of tiles. If it shows the dragon, s/he moves the dragon by one tile. If the dragon ever reaches the princess, the two of them move together from now on. If the black hat is rolled, a card is flipped over: It shows the character that has to move one tile forward. The six cards form a puzzle of the evil count. If the players manage to get all characters onto the same tile before the puzzle is complete, they win; if not, they all lose.&#10;&#10;",

Your goal is to build the most efficient hospital in three dimensions in order to get the most popularity. You will manage the construction of the building from scratch as well as the installation of new services and the recruitment of the best doctors, nurses and administrative staff that align with the arrival of new patients. You will also be attentive to the well-being of patients and not forget that time is also money when competing with neighboring hospitals...&#10;&#10;Each turn in Clinic, players take three actions &mdash; building in different modules; hosting patients; hiring doctors, nurses and staff &mdash; by playing one card. Each cube that enters the clinic comes with a car that needs to be parked, leaving less space for the hospital being constructed! During the game, you'll move patients, doctors, nurses, and staff in the 3D structure as efficiently as you can in order to save time, with doctors and nurses tending to patients as long as their colors (indicating both training and illness) match. By taking care of patients you receive money, which lets you pay fees, salaries and maintenance as well as buy popularity points.&#10;&#10;During an administrative phase, uncared for patients grow sicker, new patients enter the pre-admission room, doctors become less knowledgable about the diseases they face, and new doctors and nurses become available from their schools. In the end, the player with the most popularity points and least time spent during the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

A roll-to-hit system enables air and (optional) naval combat to scale from the small dogfights of the Fokker Scourge to the mighty clash of dreadnoughts at Jutland. On land, corps entrench by flipping which opens up an in-hex dimension for every trench battle to simulate the tactical ebb and flow that animated the front even during strategic &quot;stalemate&quot;.&#10;&#10;Since victory hinges on territorial control, the opposing sides feed men into the mill hoping to win a war of attrition before accumulated demoralization triggers a domestic political crisis to upset their balance. The prospect of a &quot;breakthrough&quot; to the green fields beyond motivates ceaseless attacks, but it's ephemeral until tanks and planes arrive in numbers. The presence of specific admirals and generals, including the U-boat ace Lothar von Arnauld de la Periere, makes the game personal.&#10;&#10;A haggle-based diplomacy system enables history buffs to recreate the land-swap politics of the period, or players can opt for a simpler, streamlined schedule of neutral entry with a dash of randomness added for surprise. Production is as simple as 1-2-3 to avoid excessive math while enabling players to comprehend the &quot;cost&quot; of their losses. In the end, victory goes to the side that beats its historical record.&#10;&#10;Link to VASSAL http://www.vassalengine.org/wiki/Module:Balance_of_Powers&#10;&#10;Link to Zun Tzu module&gt; http://www.mediafire.com/download/hrl36m0iko6by9c/Balance+of+Powers.ztb&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Every player is dealt one animal card, face down, and the goal of each player is to be the last surviving animal. There are 21 different animals, including &quot;Man,&quot; and they range from the lowly mosquito to the mighty Lion.&#10;&#10;The game is played in days and each day, players take turns either asking another player a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; question (in a quest to learn the identity of that player's animal) or attacking another player's animal (if they believe their animal is stronger that day). When an attack occurs, the player with the more powerful animal ON THAT DAY wins the attack and stays in the game. The losing animal is revealed to all and the player with the losing animal is out of the game. The game continues until only one player/animal remains and that player/animal is declared King of the Jungle.&#10;&#10;Now, while each animal has a usual strength (i.e., the Frog (3), the Crocodile (12), the Lion (20)), each day comes with a different condition (i.e., flood, monsoon, Beautiful Day). The condition of a day can change the strength of some of the animals. So, no animal is always the stronger or the weaker every day of the game. For example, while the Lion (20) on most days is more powerful than most animals, during a flood, the strength of the Crocodile rises to 21 and will defeat the Lion this day. Learning which player has which animal, when to attack another player's animal, and how to keep your animal secret, are key components to becoming King.&#10;&#10;To enhance the strategic element, you can play with Advantage Cards (included). There are six different advantage cards and each player is dealt one at the start of the game.  Advantage Cards may increase your animal's strength when attacking, it could allow your animal to &quot;Run Away&quot; from an attack, among other things.&#10;&#10;  In addition, if you download the &quot;King of the Jungle Companion App&quot; from your favorite App Stores, you will have information in your hand pertaining to facts about the animals (helpful when asking or answering questions), rule variations, and Trivia (which can be used to incorporate a reincarnation rule or determining who starts the game).  This information is also available on the game's website.&#10; This fun and hilarious game of deception, deceit, and deduction will challenge a player's memory, teach one how to ask questions, and enhance your analytical processes. It is great fun for kids, adults, adults with kids, large groups, and family get togethers. It can be played with up to 21 players!  Enjoy and good luck on becoming King!&#10;&#10;",

Players take turns placing coins from their hands onto the map based on a simple set of rules with the goal of capturing coins that have already been situated on the map.&#10;&#10;Coins are never flipped in this game, and the random element is determined by the pool of coins used to play. Thus every game is different and strategy varies based on the coins available. The length of the game is also determined by the deck of coins - when the pool is exhausted, the game ends.&#10;&#10;Despite the geographical suggestion of the art, the game is not about conquering territories from neighboring territories, but involves planning ahead and placing coins to capture the most coins for yourself, while not creating an advantageous position for your opponent(s). Coins are captured based on comparative sizes of the coins (sometimes smaller, sometimes larger) and simple rules that are written on the territories.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "As Hitler's grasp on Germany tightens and his maniacal fervor is unmasked, men from the highest levels of the Reich begin to plot his assassination. As the clock ticks and Hitler's ambitions grow, these daring few must build their strength and prepare for the perfect moment to strike. The Gestapo hound their trail, calling these conspirators &quot;Schwarze Kapelle&quot;, the Black Orchestra. Will this band of daring patriots save their country from utter ruin before it is too late?&#10;&#10;Black Orchestra begins with each player choosing a historic figure involved in the conspiracy against Hitler. In this dark and dangerous pursuit, motivation is perhaps your greatest weapon. If you can stay true to your convictions in the face of overwhelming threat and inspire your comrades, then you will be able to use your special ability, attempt plots, and even become zealous (necessary for some extremely daring plots).&#10;&#10;But every move you make may also increase the suspicion of the authorities. The Gestapo will make routine sweeps, and any players with high suspicion will be arrested and interrogated (possibly resulting in other players being arrested). If you are all arrested or if the Gestapo finds your secret papers, you lose. And the suspicion placed on each conspirator will increase the chances their plots are detected.&#10;&#10;On a turn, players may take three actions, such as moving, searching for an item, or drawing a card; or, at the cost of one action per die, roll the dice in an attempt to gain even more actions &mdash; at the risk of attracting the suspicion of the gestapo. This dice rolling &quot;Conspire&quot; action allows players to make bold moves when most needed.&#10;&#10;After the actions have been taken, an event card is drawn. The game is played over seven stages of World War 2, represented by seven stacks of event cards. These cards walk you through the events of WWII in a roughly (but not strictly) chronological order. New stages open up new areas of the board, cause Hitler and his deputies to interact with the Conspirators, and present various opportunities or threats. During the final stage, many board spaces become off-limits, as the Allies move closer to Germany.&#10;&#10;To win, players must collect a plot card and fulfill all necessary requirements listed (such as having Hitler be in a certain space and possessing certain items--detonator &amp; fuse, etc.). The active player may then attempt the plot by rolling the indicated dice, including all additional modifiers and helpful Action cards. The total of number of &quot;Target&quot; symbols needed to kill Hitler is based on Hitler's military support, but a Conspirator's security level decides if any &quot;Eagles&quot; rolled will see them detected, and foil the plot regardless. Players must consider their ability to successfully complete a plot and the relative suspicion levels of the different Conspirators involved.&#10;&#10;Players will need to work together and agree on the wisest course of action, as well as have a little luck, to succeed. The phenomenon of one player dominating the game because of its cooperative nature is mitigated by the fact that there are no certainties, and often a player will need to make a bold or reckless move to keep the conspiracy alive. Cool heads often prevail, but play it too cool and you may miss your chance. The co-operative dynamic gets really interesting if a player is ever arrested, and fails to resist interrogation, then they will need to make a big decision all by themselves, without revealing their options to the group. No one player can guarantee success. It is hoped that players will have tense conversations similar to those had by the real conspirators and enjoy a truly unique historical experience.&#10;&#10;",

The idea of the game has is to be the first to 1 million Rand (the currency of South Africa). This is done by moving round the board, drawing cards and sometimes having to answer questions related to different countries. The card also has an amount on it in the thousands which is then converted to Rands using the exchange rate of the land you just moved onto. There is also then a multiplier done based on the colour of the square you landed on. There are also Action and Bonus squares giving you a 2 &amp; 3 times bounces. You keep doing this and the first person to 1 million Rand wins.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Despite its American inspired name, Chicago has its roots in Sweden and is one of the most popular traditional card games in the country. It has an endless number of variations, so the summary below will deal with the most common rules in use today.&#10;&#10;Chicago is played with a standard deck of 52 cards. The object of the game is to score points by having the best poker hand. Each poker hand is assigned a point value (p), as follows:&#10;&#10;1p &mdash; One Pair: Two cards of the same rank (e.g.: A, 10, 10, 6, 2).&#10;2p &mdash; Two Pair: Two pairs of different ranks (e.g.: K, K, J, 4, 4).&#10;3p &mdash; Three of a Kind: Three cards of the same rank (e.g.: Q, Q, Q, 9, 6).&#10;4p &mdash; Straight: Five cards in rank sequence (e.g.: J, 10, 9, 8, 7).&#10;5p &mdash; Flush: Five cards of the same suit (e.g.: A, J, 10, 7, 3; all diamonds).&#10;6p &mdash; Full House: Three of a kind in one rank and a pair in a different rank (e.g.: Q, Q, Q, 9, 9). &#10;7p &mdash; Four of a Kind: Four cards of the same rank (e.g.: J, J, J, J, 8).&#10;9p &mdash; Straight Flush: A straight with all cards of the same suit (e.g.: J, 10, 9, 8, 7; all diamonds).&#10;&#10;Points are also awarded for taking the last trick of each round (5 points), or for scoring a &quot;Chicago&quot; by taking all five tricks of the round (15 or 25 points, must be declared by calling &quot;Chicago&quot; before any trick is played).&#10;&#10;The first player to reach a pre-determined number of points (typically 50, 52, or 100) wins the game.&#10;&#10;Common scoring variants include awarding an automatic &quot;Chicago&quot; for a holder of a straight flush instead of the normal points awarded for that hand at the end of the round. Others award points equal to the game goal (50, 52, or 100) if the straight flush is also &quot;Royal&quot; (meaning, ranks A, K, Q, J, 10).&#10;&#10;Playing a round&#10;&#10;Each player (including the dealer) is dealt 5 cards after which 3 phases follow. Before each phase, the players are allowed to discard any unwanted cards face down to the central playing area and are dealt an equal number of replacement cards.&#10;&#10;First and Second Phase&#10;&#10;Each player may now declare any poker hand which they hold (honor system). Highest hand scores points according to the value of the poker hand combination. The other players do not score. In the case of a tie, highest card used to score the hand wins (highest triple in the event of a full house). If still tied, highest non-scoring card breaks the tie. If still tied, each tied player scores full points.&#10;&#10;Variant: If you scored a poker hand, but discard at least one of the scoring cards before the next phase, you must simply announce that you are &quot;not keeping&quot; your hand.&#10;&#10;Third Phase&#10;&#10;The player to the left of the dealer leads out by playing a card in front of themselves. Each other player must follow suit, if able. The winner of the trick leads out the following trick, and so on.&#10;&#10;It is important for all players to keep their own cards separated from other player cards. All played cards should be clearly visible to all players.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the first trick, and only during the first trick, before a player has played their card, they may call &quot;Chicago&quot;. Should this happen, all players gather any cards they played back into their hand (as applicable) and the player who called &quot;Chicago&quot; will lead out instead. In order to score a successful &quot;Chicago&quot;, all five tricks must be won, no exceptions.&#10;&#10;Round Scoring&#10;&#10;The winner of the fifth and last trick scores 5 points (variant: score 10 points if you won the trick with a 2). As was done during the first two phases, the best poker hand also scores. If a successful &quot;Chicago&quot; was played, no other points are scored. A failed &quot;Chicago&quot; instead results in the caller receiving a score penalty equal to the points normally awarded (-15 or -25 points). A cumulative negative score is possible.&#10;&#10;At the end of scoring, if any player has reached the pre-determined final score, the game ends. Otherwise, or in the event of a tie, play continues. Deal passes to the left. The entire deck is re-shuffled before the initial deal each round.&#10;&#10;",

The cargos are distributed around the wells at the start of the game.&#10;&#10;Players choose a cardboard playing board printed with a train of empty cars pulled by a Chuggington character to collect cargos on.  Then they are then dealt a card showing the pattern of cargos they are to collect on their board. Patterns call for matching by combinations of shape, color, and number of items.&#10;&#10;Players take turns spinning the spinner.  Spins allow players to open boxcars to look for a cargo piece that they need for their pattern or rotate the train disk by one or two spaces.  The goal is to be the first player to collect his or her complete pattern.&#10;&#10;",

This is the &quot;ocean&quot; where the manatees are swimming. The 4 corners is where the &quot;home&quot; cards go and the very center is a stack of shuffled boat cards that should be face up. All other spaces should each have stacks of two manatee cards on them face down. &quot;&#10;&quot;On your turn, you...&#10;&#10;----1. Flip over two manatee cards. If they match, leave them face up. If they do not match, turn them face down again. (OR: if there is a stack of two face-down manatee cards adjacent to an empty space with no manatee cards, you may move the top card from the stack of two into the empty space instead of flipping any cards over.)&#10;&#10;----2. If any of YOUR manatees are face up, you may move one of them toward their home location. If you have face up manatee cards that are adjacent to each other, any adjacent manatee can follow the card that moved by moving into the space it just left, and an adjacent manatee can follow that card, and so on. Manatees move up/down and left/right but not diagonal. If a manatee makes it home, that manatee is safe and counts as a point toward winning.&#10;&#10;----3. If you moved a manatee you have to move a boat one space too (unless there are no boats left). The boat has to go toward the location matching the manatee on the card, moving up/down and left/right but not diagonal. If the boat lands on the same space as any face-up manatee, the manatee is removed from the game. The boat only moves one space per turn, even if several manatees moved by following the manatee you initially moved. When the boat makes it to the home location, the boat is out of the game.&#10;&#10;(Note: You can play competitively or cooperatively. You can move the boats to take your opponents manatees out of the game on purpose or you can work together to have none of the manatees get hit by boats.&#10; Players keep taking turns until one of the players has all of their manatees out of the game, either from getting hit by a boat or making it safely home. At this point, players should count up all the manatees they got home. Each manatee counts as one point. Whoever has the most points wins.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Mix! is a game of secret goals and tactical color theory, in which players compete to influence which of six paint colors will be applied to canvases in order to meet their own goals. This requires thoughtful play, as the control each player has over which colors are painted is indirect.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, each player is assigned a goal with two colors -- one color that will grant them points, and another that will cause them to lose points. A player's positive goal is public, while their negative goal is private. Players must work to influence the painting process so as to maximize their positive goal color, and minimize their negative goal color.&#10;&#10;Of course, this is easier said than done. Players can only affect the colors that are painted by controlling the location of a shared set of tokens on a color palette. These tokens are moved between sections of the palette by mixing together color cards from a communal pile that all players must play cards into. Players can also play action cards to affect the location of tokens, and the availability of color cards to mix.&#10;&#10;Timing is a critical aspect of Mix!, as players can only take one of three possible actions each turn -- either combining color cards to influence the palette, taking on new bonus objectives, or painting. Painting results in all players gaining and losing points based on the state of the palette, and also allows players to complete their bonus objectives. As a result, players must choose carefully when to work to influence the palette versus when to paint, in order to maximize their own gains while minimizing those of their opponents.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, private goals are revealed, and the player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;",

This was also a golden time for the workers as their skills were much needed to reform and build the new Russia.&#10;&#10;In Saint Petersburg, players play important roles in building the city of Saint Petersburg. To do this, they will take turns selecting and purchasing cards from the display of available workers, buildings and nobles. Each type of card has an associated phase, and at the end of each phase, players earn rubles and score victory points based on the cards they have collected of that type. When one of the decks runs out, the players play until the end of that round, then the game is over. Additional victory points are awarded at the end of the game depending on the number of unique nobles that each player has, and the player with the most victory points wins the game.&#10;&#10;This new edition of Saint Petersburg features an additional optional module, the Market, which adds a new card type, the market cards, and a new game phase for them. These cards bring in new resources and not only allow for new tactical opportunities, as having a majority in a resource provides extra victory points during the market phase scoring, but also allow for a fifth player to join the game. This edition also includes the two expansion modules from the original edition plus four entirely new modules.&#10;&#10;",

Will you finish all nine holes before the judges carry out their inspection?  If not will stunning scenery and design excellence be enough to beat off the opposition?&#10;&#10;The Front Nine is a card game where players compete to build the best nine hole golf course with a balance of challenging par, scenery and facilities. The course cards depict each hole (pars 3, 4 and 5)and after paying the land and resource cost for trees, water and sand, they are laid on the table to depict the actual layout of the course. Each player develops a course from club house to 1st tee and from green to following tee etc. Each hole has a differing topography which constrains tee access and green exits which results in each player's course snaking across the table. Players must manage their finances carefully to enable their course to generate an income to ensure they can afford the ever increasing land costs and resources required to design and build each hole. The winner is the player whose course design best links back to the club house, has the best design, bunkers, woodland and water hazards and optimizes the use of the natural environment.&#10;&#10;The Front Nine has direct player interaction and competition and an economic engine with an interesting spatial aspect where careful thought is needed for card purchase and placement.&#10;&#10;",

For each clue purchased the player moves his marker on a specific track and get a bonus.&#10;&#10;In the second part of the game, the mechanics changes completely, and players use the collected artifacts and more help from alchemists to win four different tests, and rescue the princess.&#10;&#10;Shazam is a game in European style with medium level of complexity and can satisfy the more experienced players and more casual!&#10;&#10;",
