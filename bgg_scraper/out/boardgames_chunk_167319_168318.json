Each round, players collectively generate a creative prompt by playing a card game. This prompt outlines the kind of future that the thing-to-be-imagined comes from, specifies what part of society or culture it belongs to, describes the type of object that it is, and suggests an emotional reaction that it might spark in an observer from the present. Players must then each write a short description of an object that fits the constraints of the prompt. These descriptions are then read aloud (without attribution), and players vote on which description they find the most interesting, provocative, or funny. The winner of each round keeps the cards put into play for that round, and whoever has the most cards when the game ends is declared the overall winner.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Generations is a collection of three games, also referred to as three &quot;generations&quot; (Discovery, Conquest and War). There are rules to play each game individually, but the set can be played in sequence as one long game, taking the players from the discovery of a new land, through colonization and industrialization, and finally to a bitter war for complete control of the land.&#10;&#10;The first generation, Discovery takes about 45-60 minutes to play. You compete to grow your population while creating a unique map on which the other games will be played. Pieces are drawn at random, and different types of placements result in different &quot;scores&quot;. It is a relatively simple game of geometric strategy, along the lines of &quot;Dominoes,&quot; &quot;Carcassonne&quot; or &quot;Blokus&quot;. Your final score is based on how effectively and efficiently you &quot;discovered&quot; the land.&#10;&#10;The second generation, Conquest takes about 60-90 minutes to play and is played on top of the map created by Generation One. This game is a race to colonize the map and build industries. You roll dice to determine where you can place your people on the board, or how you can impede your opponents. You trade in people from different land types to build industries. You can also build trade routes (allowing you to move people around) and  fortifications (to protect industries). You have to manage your assets wisely to win, but timing and luck play a role as well. The first player to achieve a &quot;stable society&quot; with four industries wins.&#10;&#10;The third generation, War, also takes 60-90 minutes to play and is played from the end state of Generation Two. Your people have all become soldiers, trade routes are now blockades, and your industries are repurposed for the war effort. The basic mechanic for battle is similar to other world conquering games (like &quot;Risk&quot;) but your industries and blockades all have unique affects on the battlefield. Your armies can move and span across territories, resulting in a war that can ebb and flow to the very end.  The last remaining player is the winner.&#10;&#10;The three games/generations are balanced in such a way to make it unlikely for a single player to win all three. And each generation uses different mechanics and different skills, allowing players of different types to engage with it.&#10;&#10;",

Veggie Sales is a simultaneous action game where players try to fulfill, as quickly as possible, their shopping cards with a variety of vegetables. The player, who collects the most vegetables in order to fulfill their shopping cards, becomes the happiest veggie shopper and wins the game!&#10;&#10;How to play:&#10;Players start the game with a certain number of Shopping Cards in hands and share a basket of random Vegetable Tokens in the center of the table. The youngest player shouts out &ldquo;Veggie Sales!&rdquo; and everyone tries to manipulate the Vegetable Tokens in the Shopping Basket so as to match the compositions on their Shopping Cards. There are three things players can do: &#10;(1) put ONE Vegetable Token into the basket, &#10;(2) remove ONE Vegetable Token from the basket, or &#10;(3) swap exactly TWO Vegetable Tokens in and out of the basket.&#10;If a player thinks that they can fulfill one of their Shopping Cards in hand, they immediately play the card in front of them, grab the Shopping Basket, and perform exactly one of the three possible actions to fulfill the card they have just played. If it successfully matches the card, they place the Shopping Card, face-up, beside them as their scores, and return the basket to the center of the table. After that they give exactly one Shopping Card in hand to any one player next to them. However, if they fail to match the card, they must turn over one of their scored card (if any), face-down, and return the basket to the center of the table, and other players may try to play cards and grab the basket for themselves.&#10;The game ends immediately when one player has got rid of all their cards in hand. All players count the total vegetable icons shown on their scored Shopping Cards. Whoever collects the most vegetable icons wins.&#10;&#10;",

These beings come into conflict in TetMithra, a game in which you score by placing blocks on your own game board or cut down your opponent's score by placing blocks on his.&#10;&#10;To set up the game, each player creates a grid of number tiles by drawing the tiles from a bag and placing them on his game board; these tiles contain four squares in a row, with the squares being red, green, yellow and blue and containing the numbers 3-6 in some order. On the first turn, the starting player draws three block tiles, which show the shape of the blocks available for this turn; the blocks are Tetris-style quadrominoes that have squares in four colors. The player chooses one of these pieces and places it on his board within one minute, scoring points for the like-colored squares touching this block. Thus, if a red 5 on his grid is adjacent to a red square on the block he just placed, he scores five points.&#10;&#10;The next player then reveals a new block tile, reveals the new block, then places one of the three blocks in his grid. From a player's third turn on, he can choose to place a block in an opponent's grid, costing him points.&#10;&#10;The game ends when either only two blocks remain unplaced, no blocks can be placed in either grid, or one player has more than 180 points or less than -50 points. At this time, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

A scientist races to find a solution in his makeshift lab. A traitor steals the last escape pod in the very last moment. Intruders you meet on the ship are not only reacting to the noise you make but also evolve as the time goes by. The longer the game takes, the stronger they become. During the game, you control one of the crew members with a unique set of skills, personal deck of cards, and individual starting equipment. These heroes cover all your basic SF horror needs. For example, the scientist is great with computers and research, but will have a hard time in combat. The soldier, on the other hand...&#10;&#10;Nemesis is a semi-cooperative game in which you and your crewmates must survive on a ship infested with hostile organisms. To win the game, you have to complete one of the two objectives dealt to you at the start of the game and get back to Earth in one piece. You will find many obstacles on your way: swarms of Intruders (the name given to the alien organisms by the ship AI), the poor physical condition of the ship, agendas held by your fellow players, and sometimes just cruel fate.&#10;&#10;The gameplay of Nemesis is designed to be full of climactic moments which, hopefully, you will find rewarding even when your best plans are ruined and your character meets a terrible fate.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In Ashes: Rise of the Phoenixborn, a two-player expandable card game, players take on the roles of Phoenixborns, demi-gods and protectors of this world. These characters are the great saviors of their civilizations. Before they came into existence, the humans were plagued by monsters like chimeras that took away their lands and forced them to live in walled-off cities. When the Phoenixborns came, they fought off the chimeras and freed the lands for humans to take over once again.&#10;&#10;But the time of peace was short-lived. A prophecy arose that if one Phoenixborn was able to absorb enough Ashes of others, they would ascend into full gods and take mastery over this world. This, as well as humans' greed for land, fueled the War of Ashes. The great cities now fight among each other, each one of them with a Phoenixborn at its helm, and you will decide who will rise and who will fall to ashes.&#10;&#10;Ashes Reborn: Rise of the Phoenixborn, released in 2021, features the same Phoenixborn as in the original Ashes with the same cards, but some cards have been modified to balance them. (Publisher Plaid Hat Games estimates that about 30% of all cards across all expansions are being modified.) The rules have undergone a few changes as well, mostly to clarify powers. The Ashes Reborn 1.5 Upgrade Kit contains more than 350+ updated Ashes cards, along with an updated rulebook, allowing players to move from the original game to the new 1.5 rules.&#10;&#10;",

You must build an army for defense, and maybe an attack or two.  But you must carefully watch your food supply and the size of your army because of spoilage and fungus plagues. If you can exterminate another colony's home hill or build a great temple hill, all the other colonies will surrender to you and you will be an instant winner. Or if the forest is cleared first, you can win by having the most wealth.&#10;&#10;Ants 4X is a diceless game.  This gives the players choices instead of relying on luck.  Battles are resolved by secret deployment of soldiers ants, simultaneously revealed.  Of course, the explore actions, by necessity, will involve finding random items.  Everything you find will be useful for something, but you may need to change your strategy.&#10;&#10;Ants 4X is not an educational or epic game, just a fun, fast playing game that includes all the basic 4X actions, resource management and a dab of ant know-how thrown in for good measure.&#10;&#10;",

Caricatures on game cards and money represent actual PRL-produced commodities and Polish currency from that period.&#10;&#10;",

They face the challenges of restoring Warsaw destroyed during World War 2, bringing back the city&rsquo;s prestige and importance in the fields of administration, culture and industry.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to rebuild Warsaw after the war and develop the city. The players have to get concrete, use the materials acquired from the debris of the destroyed Capital and various social funds that were used in reality during the rebuilding of Warsaw. However, not only the reconstruction itself is important, but also the appropriate location of the objects on the city map and competent delegation of the members of one&rsquo;s studio to work. One of the several tactical elements of the game is managing the project cards and workers. Using their extra abilities may be the key which will benefit one player and make the work much harder for another. But even for a moment they should not forget about acquiring building materials from prefabricated elements and building new panel blocks.&#10;&#10;The game covers the period of thirty-five years, so in subsequent stages many various tasks appear. They are related to political doctrines, tendencies in architecture as well as the general economical and developmental situation in Poland in the given period. But the most important feature of the game is that each time the players are able to rebuild Warsaw in a different way from this known from history. They decide whether the historical rebuilding plan will be realized and where &ndash; if at all &ndash; the Palace of Culture and Science will stand. The players also have an access to the plans that were never realized, both from the Six-Year Plan and later urban development concepts. The game includes a futuristic element, too &ndash; the players have plans of two subway lines at their disposal. Such plans actually existed in post-war Warsaw, but they were never realized due to economic problems. In this game it is possible.&#10;&#10;",

Players will choose attributes and goals for their characters from a hand of cards and will then pick from one of two scenarios: &quot;Lab of the Mad Wizard&quot; or &quot;Shopping with Humans.&quot;&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, the other players pick one of the active character's attributes and one of her goals and narrate a scene of how that attribute gets the character into trouble while she pursues the goal. Then, the active player must describe the character's attempt to get out of that trouble and meet the selected goal using her other attribute.&#10;&#10;For example, let's say your group is playing the scenario &quot;Lab of the Mad Wizard.&quot; Your character has the attributes &quot;Short term memory loss&quot; and &quot;Sarcasm&quot; and the goals of &quot;Needs to burn the place down (even just a little bit)&quot; and &quot;Wants to hurt the feelings of character on right.&quot; The other players might narrate a scene in which you completely forget where you are and what you are doing and then notice a book of matches on the table. You start playing with the matches, which draws the attention of a quivering tower of sentient slime who wants to swallow you and your pretty matches. Now you must narrate your character's effort to get out of this situation using her sarcasm while she tries to meet her goal of burning the place down. Can you manage to crack a sarcastic remark that gets you away from the monster while lighting fire to something?&#10;&#10;More importantly, can you tell the tale convincingly enough that the other players will vote for your success? They will decide if your attempt was successful or not and whether or not your goal was met, and they will narrate the results accordingly.&#10;&#10;Players WIN who manage to meet the goals of their characters before four rounds have passed, and they celebrate by narrating the fates of their characters freely. Players LOSE whose character's goals are not met before the end of four rounds, and they must narrate the deaths of their characters.&#10;&#10;",

Alice must find the White Rabbit among the Trump Soldiers, to escape from the palace. The White Rabbit might know where to go. Alice who wants to catch the White Rabbit and the Queen who wants to catch Alice&hellip; The hide-and-seek between Alice and the Queen of Heart now begins.&#10;&#10;Goal&#10;Chasing Alice is a 2-player game, and each player becomes Alice and the Queen of Heart. With your reasoning, find where the opponent is. The player who catches another first wins the game. The victory condition for each player is different, however, so you&rsquo;ll need a different strategy on each role. Don&rsquo;t forget! Catch her before you get caught.&#10;&#10;Game Play&#10;Each player takes a role as Alice or the Queen of Heart. Two players share the space of game board and their locations on the board are hidden. Each player uses a recording sheet to mark his location and information of the opponent&rsquo;s location.&#10;In one&rsquo;s turn, do one action of two as follow.&#10;1. Move: Choose one of the cards and place it face up in front of the Blind Cover. According to the suit on the card, change your location to the adjacent box. &lsquo;The adjacent box&rsquo; includes all 8 directions. You cannot move to the box you have ever been. The Queen may move the White Rabbit only once, and Alice may move herself twice. Make sure you mark your path for each move.&#10;2. Trace: Reveal the two cards in your hand to the opponent, and announce a single location with the card numbers combined. Trace the selected box and the adjacent boxes. The opponent must say how many boxes she had been among those 9 boxes.&#10;After an action, a player can say &lsquo;GOTCHA!&rsquo;. This action is optional, and you can decide whether to do it or not. If you succeed, you win a victory; otherwise you lose the game immediately. Carefully do this action for the game. The condition for catching the opponent varies in different roles.&#10;- The Queen of Heart: Guess where Alice is, and point exactly one box on the Game Board. If it is correct, the Queen wins a victory. Otherwise the Queen loses the game.&#10;- Alice: With no pointing, both players reveal their location. If Alice and the White Rabbit are near enough to reach within a box, Alice wins a victory. Otherwise Alice loses the game.&#10;&#10;Game end&#10;If any of the players succeed or fail the action &lsquo;GOTCHA&rsquo;, the game ends immediately.&#10;Or if the Game Cards run out (which means each player took 5 turns) without determining any result, Alice fails to escape and the Queen wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "A turn-based board game for 2-6 players based on the video game Ingress.&#10;&#10;Theme:&#10;In the middle of the 19th Century, a trade ship named Niantic departed Connecticut and set sail on a voyage to the Orient coast.  Some say the Niantic was smuggling Opium out of China and Indonesia but while that may have been a side deal worked out for its journey home, the merchant vessel Niantic docked in Whampoa Harbor and unloaded a precious cargo.&#10;&#10;A relic, uncovered during an archeological dig hundreds of years earlier, was transported to Whampoa Harbor and buried there.&#10;&#10;The relic laid buried in the area that later became known as Whampoa Garden until approximately 150 years later, when in 1999, Liu Fan excavated it and working in combination with a group of international researchers, went to work unlocking its secrets.&#10;&#10;Ingress: The Relic casts up to six researchers in roles to unlock the undiscovered power of exotic matter.  Researchers take turns placing portal tiles on the relic board and activating them with resonator tokens.  Connecting three fully activated portal tiles can lead to an even greater power by creating a control field.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;The game plays out on a grid-based board with tiles in a manner somewhat reminiscent of Go or Chinese Checkers.  Winners use a combination of action cards and tile placement to earn action points.  The player to first reach 50 action points or the player with the most action points at the end of 10 rounds wins.&#10;&#10;",

Building types consist of residential buildings, goods and economic buildings, buildings required for growth as well as the military and defence buildings required for keeping players, and random events out of your settlement.&#10;&#10;Having a constant income is only part of the struggle, with droughts, floods, fires, roaming bandits and more coming into play. As well as balancing your stretch to victory without becoming a prime target for other players and their military.&#10;&#10;Multiple paths to victory, be the first to achieve a city, or last 24 in game months and come out with the best score across multiple categories.&#10;&#10;Small enough to play anywhere, big enough to get stuck in.&#10;&#10;Isometric artwork heralds back to the late 90's strategy and empire building boom.&#10;&#10;",

The game lasts five rounds with each player taking a turn in each round.&#10;&#10;To start a turn, a player grabs and rolls two or three dice from the bag. From that point on, the player has a choice of stopping and scoring points, or drawing and rolling three more dice. If a player ever has three of the same number or color showing, that player's turn ends and she scores nothing &mdash; unless she also has a die face that shows &quot;Free (number)&quot; or &quot;Free (color)&quot;, in which case that number or color can't bust her for the turn. If a player has used all 18 dice in the bag, she must stop.&#10;&#10;To determine a score for the round, first remove all of the &quot;Free ____&quot; dice, then sum the digits on the dice that remain. If, however, you've rolled one or both of the lucky dice in the bag, your score might be boosted (or halved). A &quot;1:5&quot; on a lucky die, for example, means that 1s give you five points instead of one. A &quot;1/2&quot; means that your sum is halved, but if you roll both &quot;1/2&quot; symbols, then your score is doubled instead.&#10;&#10;The player with the highest score after five rounds wins!&#10;&#10;",

Fortunately, the condition can be reversed, though there may be some residual side-effects.  In the meantime though... players must battle each other to survive!&#10;&#10;Zombie ApocalyOOPS is a fast paced card game in which players switch between human and zombie in a free-for-all battle.  Each card is split in half and color coded.  Blue halves are playable by humans, green by zombies, and white by any race.  If a player chooses (or is forced) to change race, they must flip their hand to the corresponding color.&#10;&#10;The game also includes 22 Event cards, of which a random 10 are used each game.  This provides high replay value, and also a chaotic element similar to what one might expect in a real zombie apocalypse.&#10;&#10;",

Players then tally their scores, earning 3 points for each border that contains more of their marks than the opponent's, 2 or 4 points for each trough they control, and 2-20 points for each herd they have, depending on the size of the herd.

In October of that year the Batavia, with 341 souls aboard, would set sail to the East Indies. Everything seemed to be going great on it's maiden voyage... But on June 4th of 1629 the ship ran aground near the coast of Australia. Only a handful of people survived the disaster and the following mutiny...&#10;&#10;Every player plays the skipper of a VOC ship. The starting player will roll the die determining how many spaces everybody gets to move. If a player ends his move in a port they can stock up on goods (for free). If a player ends in the Home port he can unload his goods thereby securing them from the pirate and the other players. And if a player lands next to another player he can attack them (high roller wins, difference in roll is the amount of goods that can be stolen).&#10;&#10;Secured goods can be used to buy parts of a players own Batavia which also yields an advancement for the players current VOC ship.&#10;After a player has build his own Batavia, he will have to sail it from the Home port to Batavia city to win the game.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Ragnaroll is a game of glory, death and dice. A great winter has descended upon the land, the sun has disappeared, the sea has frozen over, there's no more crops or cattle and all you have left is a few winter stores and, of course, your fluid Viking sense of ownership.&#10;&#10;In Ragnaroll, you control a band of Viking warriors, each represented by a custom die, struggling to survive. Your band consists of a unique hero, 2 soldiers, 1 shieldmaiden and a loyal, but slightly unreliable, dog. You'll need to fight to protect your precious food stores, as well as raid your opponents for glory and more food. It's a harsh winter wasteland, and the last Viking alive wins, unless of course Ragnaroll happens first.&#10;&#10;A round of Ragnaroll starts by revealing an event card, which will provide some incentives and rewards for your Vikings to leave their comfy halls. Next, players secretly separate their warriors into their defenders and their raiders. Players reveal their selection simultaneously and the boldest and bravest player, the one with the smallest raiding party, seizes the Initiative, gaining control of raid order for the round. If there's any ties, you'll need to literally seize the initiative by grabbing the initiative token from the centre of the table.&#10;&#10;In the order of the Initiative holders choice, each player conducts a little bit of Norse business, pitting your raiders against your opponents defenders and using your defenders to protect your stores from your enemy&rsquo;s raiders. Battle is resolved through rolling dice and using special battle abilities fuelled by glory. Each hero has a unique set of powers that will enable them to turn luck into fate. Each player, starting with the raider, will use a battle ability, and then the winner will be determined. Whoever has the most axes win, but you'll be able to block axes with shields and appeal to Odin to reroll results. The winner of the battle will get to steal stores or slay his opponent's warriors, but each player will also gain glory. In addition to glory provided through the event for the round, every hero has a different path to glory, some will delight in crushing their enemies, while others will be satisfied with survival and some may even gain glory through defeat.&#10;&#10;After all players have raided, they will return to their falls and feed their warriors, but with stores running low, not all mouths are worth feeding. You can send any of your Vikings out into the snow for a long walk, saving precious resources, and if you get really desperate, you can even eat the dog. After you&rsquo;ve fed, you&rsquo;ll draw a new event card and start all over again. The game will end in one of 3 ways, each of which show the gods that one band of warriors is fit to fight alongside them in Ragnaroll. When there&rsquo;s only one player with Vikings left, that player wins, demonstrating they have the strength and cunning to fight with the gods, but if all players run out of stores at the same time, you will all conduct one last glorious battle and the player with the most axes will emerge victorious. However, if any player is able to demonstrate they are truly worthy of the god&rsquo;s favour by gaining 15 glory, they will immediately win and take their rightful place in Valhalla.&#10;&#10;Ragnarol is a game where your choices matter. You&rsquo;ll need to balance risk and rewards, and manage your precious, dwindling resources, making hard decisions for the survival of your clan. The dice-based combat doesn&rsquo;t simply mean that your fate into the hands of the gods, as you&rsquo;ll be able to influence the outcome of the battle using your glory-fueled powers, but you&rsquo;ll need to choose the battles that are worth the cost.&#10;&#10;",

A knight can't enter a lake (blub), a mountain with an opposing pawn, or any space with an opponent's city or stronghold or two knights of the same opposing color.

In addition to the usual Chess pieces and two more pawns, each player also has one centurion, starting in the fourth column, and one decurion, starting in the seventh. The centurion jumps to any square two squares distant, either in a straight line or changing direction like a knight. The decurion moves a single square in any diagonal direction, like the fers of Shatranj.&#10;&#10;The options and restrictions regarding promotion, castling and en passant are slightly different from regular Chess and/or slightly ambiguous. For instance, pawns are promoted when reaching the last row and always promote to queens.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "As documented by Harold Murray and John Gollon, Shatranj Kamil was an early and largely unsuccessful attempt to expand the game of Shatranj. The board has been enlarged from 8x8 to 10x10, and in addition to two more pawns, each player is given two of a new piece, the camel, which jumps two spaces in a straight orthogonal line (i.e. it is an orthogonal counterpart to the elephant and significantly weaker than the rook). The camels have variously been placed in the corners, in the fourth and seventh columns, and possibly in other configurations. The rules and pieces are otherwise the same as in Shatranj. The word &quot;kamil&quot; does not refer to the camel piece, but instead means &quot;perfect&quot; or &quot;complete&quot;.&#10;&#10;This game should not be confused with Tamerlane Chess, which is also referred to as Shatranj Kamil; most likely there were several other variants being ascribed the status of higher perfection.&#10;&#10;",

Welcome to New Earth...'&#10;&#10;Just one continent remains home to civilisation after a cataclysmic event. Much of the human race has perished &ndash; from billions to a few million. The world as we knew it has gone. Those that survived are split into various &lsquo;factions&rsquo; (or proto-nations). Each player assumes the role of a &lsquo;government&rsquo; leader charged with building his/her &lsquo;country&rsquo; by developing existing resources and assets; whilst expending production in the form of consumption and government cash on infrastructure.&#10;&#10;As much as each nation will want to trade with each other, there remains the probability that political and economical control of land and resources (zones) become ever more critical. Progress is measured in terms of social development levels and the emergence of new cities. The higher the Development Level the higher the value of each zone and thus victory points, but watch out for the 'catastrophes'.&#10;&#10;New Earth is a strategy game for 2-4 players with elegant game mechanics combining worker placement with innovative hand management and modular tile design that provides endless game scenarios. Game length is 12 turns and lasts around 60-90 minutes, though players can agree on an extended time-frame. For ages 12 &amp; up.&#10;&#10;",

Using elements of both Hand Management and Area Control, players are rewarded for both their ability to optimize actions and by strategically placing Unit Cards to gain points.  Some luck is involved through both drawing cards and unit placement, but players who can master their decks can dominate the battlefield..&#10;&#10;Each kingdom/faction contains a set of 18 cards.  Unit Cards are placed on the Board and determine the end of game (once all of the spaces are occupied, the game is over) and the scoring (capturing other units or occupying spaces.  Strategy Cards allow for creating combinations and rule bending.  The 'Board' is made up of Terrain Cards and can be configured to any shape or design - presenting a new set of challenges, potential strategies, and time limit for each new game.&#10;&#10;Players are limited to 1 action per turn: Draw 1 Card or Play 1 Card. But, certain cards allow for the creation of combinations and special rule bending - creating a lot of nuance and strategy as the game progresses.  TK is based on the Three Kingdoms period of China and the historical-fiction book, 'Romance of the Three Kingdoms,' by Luo Guanzhong.&#10;&#10;",

The Player assumes the role of the head of the Tokugawa Clan during the later decades of Japan&rsquo;s Wars of Unification (1540-1600). As the Leader of the Tokugawa Clan, you have the powerful ambition of conquering your Clan Rivals and unifying all of Japan&rsquo;s Provinces under one ruler, you. Will you be able to fulfil your destiny to become the Shogun of Japan?&#10;&#10;GAME OBJECTIVE: The Player takes the role of the Daimyo of the Tokugawa Clan and must muster his forces and manage his assets to defeat the rival Clans. The Player must control a number of Settlements whose Fortification Values (FV) total 60 or more by the time the last Campaign Card is played. If the Player controls a number of Settlements whose FV total is 20 or less during the Victory Check Phase, the Player loses.&#10;&#10;GAME FEATURES: Samurai Conquest features a 4-Sheet Map, lots of colorful game counters, Campaign Cards, a Battle Mat for resolving Battles and much more. Units include Ashigaru Spearmen, Teppo (Arquebusiers) Infantry, Samurai Foot, Samurai Cavalry and individual Samurai Champions.&#10;&#10;If you love movies like Ran, Kagemushi, The Hidden Throne, and Heaven and Earth, you will enjoy this game.&#10;&#10;Samurai Conquest can be found at the following URL:&#10;http://www.berserkergames.net&#10;&#10;",

What they do not have in abundance is time.  The island and its vital airfields must be conquered quickly to allow the 77th Infantry Division to be transferred to Okinawa as soon as possible.  Even so the American side must achieve its mission with no more than a modest number of casualties otherwise the 77th will be in no condition to relieve the 96th Infantry Division on Okinawa as it did historically.  An economy of force approach must be adopted and assets such as air power, armor, artillery, and the American Navy all used to maximum efficiency.&#10;&#10;The Japanese player has a mixed bag of forces ranging from regular army units to airfield construction personnel to island civilians.  Defeating the invasion at the landing beaches isn&rsquo;t the goal so much as making the invaders pay as high a price as possible.  With this in mind the Japanese player must focus their defense on the best terrain&mdash;primarily Mount Gusuku and the urban areas adjacent to it&mdash;but always be on the lookout for opportunities to upset the American timetable with judicious placement of machine gun nests and pockets of civilian resistance behind American lines.  The island&rsquo;s artillery possesses the capability to inflict attritional losses on the invaders, and the threat of a kamikaze attack on the 5th Fleet is something the American player must account for.  The arrival of night each turn opens the door for small Japanese assaults which, along with satchel charges, might produce a local victory as happened historically at Bloody Ridge, or at the very least see the American player surrendering control of the advantage marker to demand a reroll.  Changes in the weather are random, but the arrival of rain benefits the Japanese side, as does the appearance of rubble in urban areas.&#10;&#10;An optional rule allows players to experience the uplifting presence of Ernie Pyle being close to the front and the leadership provided by Major Igawa personally joining the combat, though at the risk of seeing these historical figures killed in action.&#10;&#10;Game components: one cover sheet, one 22&rdquo;x17&rdquo; unmounted map, one countersheet of &frac12;&rdquo; counters, and a rulebook; all in a bag.&#10;&#10;",

The players play until there is no more moves possible and the winner is the one who has the highest score calculated from the values of the tiles.&#10;&#10;Extra tiles are special moves designed to change the tide in one or another's player favour. They are :stop, :swirl, :gold, :bomb and :star (described below).&#10;&#10;A stop tile prevents an opponent to turn all tiles in a line up until the stop tile (included) rather than until the opponent&rsquo;s bounding tile.&#10;&#10;A swirl tile turns all the opponent&rsquo;s tiles aside in all 8 directions plus all playable line up.&#10;&#10;A gold tile behaves like stop tile but cannot be turn ever. It can be laid down at the beginning to add a handicap.&#10;&#10;A bomb tile explodes the tiles aside in all 8 directions regardless of the colour. The tile itself can stay on the board for an added handicap.&#10;&#10;A star tile gives extra points (e.g. 5 points) and cannot be turned ever but will not prevent a line up to turn.&#10;&#10;",

Things quickly turned bad as the virus mutated and became immune to the existing antigen. Rather then accept responsibility, GenTech sat back hoping the virus would stop spreading.&#10;&#10;Five years later, and nearly 75% of the worlds population has been affected. Some have been reanimated from the dead, others gruesomely mutated into something that no longer resembles a human life form. Pick your side. GenTech? Rogue military? Civilian? Street Gang? Private security? Government? Scientist?&#10;&#10;Build your deck and try to survive one more day.&#10;&#10;Game Play&#10;&#10;Players must construct decks from predefined Base Decks along with optional expander packs to customize their chosen deck. All packs contain no randomization or rarity. Similar CCG themes are present such as playing cards from your hand, drawing from a draw pile and having cards discarded from play through various mechanics.&#10;&#10;Various card mechanics allow players to draw additional cards, reduce an opponents hand, introduce survivors (your team), use zombies and mutants to harm your opponent and use defensive barriers and equipment to protect your survivors while trying to defeat your opponent.&#10;&#10;Each faction has team members which have skill levels in certain skills. These skill levels give them access to &quot;doing&quot; things through playing cards which match their required skill levels.&#10;&#10;For example, a Geneticist has a Skill Level of 3 and can create more powerful mutants then say a Lab Assistant with a Skill Level of only 1.&#10;&#10;The end game is to defeat the opposing faction by using your survivors and equipment along with their abilities to either control zombies, engineer mutants or simply use brute force in this post-apocalyptic card game!&#10;&#10;",

For this, the player must reach 25 points before his rivals, but beware, not always the other students will play under the rules (and probably you too)!&#10;&#10;Escola de Drag&otilde;es is a filler cardgame for 2-4 players (the use of 2 decks allows 5-8 players), no language needed and simple rules, where the interaction between players aims to undermine the possibility victory of the rivals.&#10;&#10;The game uses a deck of 54 cards and is aimed primarily at children and young-adults (8+ years) or groups that don't have the habit of playing cardgames.&#10;&#10;&#10;User Description (Portuguese):&#10;&#10;Estamos nos &uacute;ltimos dias de aula que antecedem a formatura de mais uma turma de alunos da Escola de Drag&otilde;es, uma poderosa institui&ccedil;&atilde;o de ensino da doutrina da Draconaria, a arte de treinar drag&otilde;es.&#10;Chegou a hora de descobrir quem foi o aluno que se dedicou com maior afinco aos segredos do treinamento de Drag&otilde;es, j&aacute; que apenas um dos alunos receber&aacute; o t&iacute;tulo de Mestre Treinador!&#10;&#10;Escola de Drag&otilde;es s&oacute; tem um objetivo: descobrir qual dos alunos &eacute; o Mestre Treinador. Para isso, o jogador deve alcan&ccedil;ar 25 Pontos de Treinamento antes dos rivais, mas cuidado, nem sempre os outros alunos jogar&atilde;o limpo (e provavelmente nem voc&ecirc;)!&#10;&#10;Escola de Drag&otilde;es &eacute; um filler, ou seja, um jogo de cartas para 2 a 4 jogadores (usar 2 baralhos permite 5 a 8 jogadores), independente de idioma e com regras simples, cuja intera&ccedil;&atilde;o entre jogadores visa minar a possibilidade de vit&oacute;ria dos rivais.&#10;&#10;O jogo utiliza um baralho de 54 cartas e &eacute; direcionado principalmente ao p&uacute;blico infanto-juvenil (a partir de 8 anos) ou grupos que n&atilde;o tenham o h&aacute;bito de jogar cardgames.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "This latest version of Bin'Fa: The Tao of War has many changes from those familiar with its previous incarnations (Hexagony, Bin'Fa), such as the addition of the General; Vortexes that allow you to traverse the board in one move, appearing where least expected; rule changes governing the gathering of supplies, and the separation of the original hexagon shaped game board into six separate game board sections which offer almost limitless possibilities for new terrain each game.&#10;&#10;In Bin-Fa, armies move over a landscape that is different each game. A player controls at least one but can control up to three armies per game. You can use the board sections to create inlets, peninsulas, isthmuses, lakes, and more. Adding vortex and terrain markers allows you even more control over the layout of the game board and how it will be traversed. Your ability to take advantage of the layout of the battlefield is crucial to victory and defeat.&#10;&#10;Each army is made up of 12 Army Units, one General, and one Supply Pawn. At the start of your turn, you must decide if you are going for supplies or moving your army.  On taking possession of the dice: first see if any of your Army Units are in danger and if so, respond defensively; second, see if any of your opponent's Army Units are vulnerable and, if possible, attack; third, if neither of these choices applies, go for supplies. Sun Tzu says: &quot;Do not move without considering all the possibilities. Move always with a clear purpose.&quot;&#10;&#10;The rules for movement of your army allow you to simulate many strategies from the ancient battlefield. Even &ldquo;cavalry charges&rdquo; are possible&mdash;where a unit dashes across the board to attack an enemy position. Your mission is to surround and eliminate enemy Army Units until only your Army is left, leaving you the victor.&#10;Deals and alliances can be made in the open or in secret. But only one commander can emerge victorious: knowing when and with whom to form alliances and when to break them can sometimes determine who wins and who loses.&#10;&#10;",

DT can be learned in 5 minutes and played in under 30 minutes with endless replayability.&#10;&#10;Dungeon Talk is a 2-6 player fantasy party game for family, adults, and kids and comes with over 280 game cards with 12,000 variations for endless re-playability.&#10;&#10;Basic Game Overview: In the basic game, a new fantasy picture is revealed (each picture is on a huge 6x4 card). Players choose a Talk Card from their hand which they feel best represents the picture, is the most silly, or drums up the most laughs. One player acts as the Adventure Master, which rotates every turn, reads each Talk Card aloud then chooses a Talk Card he/she likes most. This continues every turn until a player's Talk Card is chosen three times!&#10;&#10;Advanced Game Overview:  After choosing your hero (each having a unique game power), you'll draw 5 Dungeon Talk cards (talk cards have funny sayings, quotes, etc on them).&#10;&#10;Talk cards are used by you to describe an adventure card (a fantasy scene with some really cool art). Each turn a new adventure card is drawn from the current Act deck of your quest. The acts are The Fellowship, Journey, and Destination.&#10;&#10;Each turn a new player acts as the Adventure Master (AM). Players, except the AM, chooses a talk card from their hand and plays it face down.&#10;&#10;The AM then draws a random talk card from the talk card deck and shuffles it in with the players' chosen talk cards. He reads aloud each talk card and chooses one he/she feels best describes the picture, is the funniest, most outrageous, drums up the most laughs, and so on.&#10;&#10;If a player's card is chosen he gains a level and loot (loot can be in the form of gold coins, equipment,potions, spells, or weapons which can be used to aid yourself or hinder others).&#10;&#10;If the random card was chosen, one player is cursed (a random negative effect is played on him). Throughout the game, players can use their special hero power and unique items they've earned to help themselves or hinder other players getting too close to winning!&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player reaches glorious level 5! Whomever has accumulated the most gold wins! There's a few more rules but that's the general gist of Dungeon Talk.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Retrieved from http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/67991987&#10;&#10;The Advocate, Burnie, Tasmania, Australia, 31 Dec. 1932.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;CONTRACT WHIST.&#10;&#10;No Hands Down.&#10;WEAKNESS SOLVED.&#10;&#10;Why a four-handed game of cards such as the various forms of bridge should be played by three persons is one of those mysteries that have never been explained. Probably this is because there is no explanation. It seems absurd that one of the four players should have to stand out of every game.&#10;&#10;And if the game is one of skill, as is confidently asserted, its value is much diminished by the exposure of one of the hands.&#10;&#10;In whist each player knew only what was in his own hand. He had to use his reason or his imagination to decide what was in the hands of his partner or of his two opponents.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Bridge Without the Dummy.&#10;&#10;In the various forms of bridge his partner's hand is exposed once the bidding is over. Each player knows two hands, and so much of the real interest of the game is lost.&#10;&#10;It is these things that have led to the invention of contract whist, or &quot;bridge without the dummy,&quot; as set out by Hubert Phillips in &quot;Contract Whist.&quot;&#10;&#10;This is distinctly a whist game, since each player plays his own hand. There is no exposure of one hand, as in bridge. It is this, the author claims, which gives the game its special fascination. And, indeed, it is a sensible idea.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, the bidding and scoring follow the lines of contract bridge, with changes and simplification.&#10;&#10;As there is no recognised organisation to frame the rules of contract whist, the author has done it himself. He does not, however, claim to have invented the game. He says that the idea of bridge without the dummy has existed for years. The rule that only tricks actually contracted for can count towards the game is retained. The things rejected are, &quot;Vulnerability, the bidding of slams, and unnecessarily complicated scoring.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;The Scoring.&#10;&#10;The scoring suggested is:&#10;&#10;(1) A game is secured by the first side that scores 10 points. Rubber is the best of three games.&#10;&#10;(2) Points count toward game only when scored &quot;below the line.&quot; These are points for tricks which the declaring side has contracted to make. Tricks at No Trumps count 4 points each. Tricks at a suit declaration count 3 points each. Tricks made by the declarers, but not contracted for are scored above the line, and count only 2 each. Where a contract has been doubled or redoubled, the value of each trick is doubled or redoubled. Over tricks are 5 each doubled, and 10 redoubled.&#10;&#10;(3) Where the contract is defeated the defending side scores [above the line] 10 points for each trick which the declaring side has failed to make. If the contract has been doubled the deficiency score is 20 points; if redoubled 40.&#10;&#10;(4) Nothing is scored for honors.&#10;&#10;(5) The side winning the rubber receives 50 points.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Rubber of 100 Points.&#10;&#10;The average rubber is about 100 points in all.&#10;While the score is the same for all suit declarations, the preference in bidding is the same as in bridge--spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs.&#10;&#10;Contract whist differs from bridge in that the play cannot be planned by the declarer from the outset.&#10;&#10;The author gives many illustrations which suggest that contract whist could be made a most fascinating game.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Garbage Pail Kids: Super Snot Shots supports 2-4 players and is a dexterity game that involves flicking dice (that represent snot) at a target. Each player chooses one of the four snot-covered Leaky Lindsay cards and a six-sided die of the same color, then takes a position around a target card. The cards in the game are all squares with rounded edges; they feature eleven Garbage Pail kids, all featuring classic Garbage Pail Kids art, everyone from Surf's Up Chuck to Dead Ted to Mark Barf.&#10;&#10;You make a draw pile out of the cards and select one to be a target, placing it in the middle of everyone and placing your Leaky Lindsay card two card-lengths away. Once set-up is complete, count down &quot;3, 2, 1, SHOOT!&quot;, then flick your die from your Lindsay card towards the target card, trying to aim it so that your die stops on top of it. If only one player gets her die on the target card, she claims it; if two or more dice land on the card, then whoever has the highest number showing on her die wins it; if no one lands on the card, then it's a tie and everyone shoots again!&#10;&#10;The game continues until no cards remain, and whoever has the most cards wins.&#10;&#10;",

The Teen Titans are all about proving themselves, and with this set you can save your best cards for when you really need them. When you&rsquo;re ready, unleash everything you&rsquo;ve got and the results will be spectacular.&#10;&#10;The big new focus of DC Comics Deck-Building Game: Teen Titans revolves around Ongoing abilities: Cards that stay in play until you need them. Every time you put an Ongoing card into play, it essentially gives you an extra card to utilize on a future turn. Previously, only Locations and a couple of other cards could ever stay in play. Now every card type at every power level has multiple different cards with Ongoing. Sometimes they help you every turn. But mostly they stay in play until you choose to discard them for their mighty effects. If you can build up several Ongoing cards, unleash as many as you need to take down the Super-Villains!&#10;&#10;This set also pays attention to the different card types you have in play. Playing cards from your hand puts cards into play as usual. But with Ongoing cards out there, you often have several card types in play already. Such synergy!&#10;&#10;",

If you have the appropriate counter card, you can ignore the distraction.&#10;&#10;A simple discard mechanic adds a subtle layer of strategy: choose which cards to hold or discard, keeping your defensive cards, or going on the offense. Wild cards like &quot;Flat Tire!&quot; and &quot;Bully!&quot; help you stick it to your opponent and gain an upper hand.&#10;&#10;Once you throw your paper, turn over a card from the green &quot;Toss Deck,&quot; to see how good your throw was. With every successful paper toss, you gain a Paper Token. The first player to collect 10 Tokens wins the game! Can you be the first one to toss all your papers?&#10;&#10;",

Giant corporations, sponsored by the World Government on Earth, initiate huge projects to raise the temperature, the oxygen level, and the ocean coverage until the environment is habitable. In Terraforming Mars, you play one of those corporations and work together in the terraforming process, but compete for getting victory points that are awarded not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for advancing human infrastructure throughout the solar system, and doing other commendable things.&#10;&#10;The players acquire unique project cards (from over two hundred different ones) by buying them to their hand. The projects (cards) can represent anything from introducing plant life or animals, hurling asteroids at the surface, building cities, to mining the moons of Jupiter and establishing greenhouse gas industries to heat up the atmosphere. The cards can give you immediate bonuses, as well as increasing your production of different resources. Many cards also have requirements and they become playable when the temperature, oxygen, or ocean coverage increases enough. Buying cards is costly, so there is a balance between buying cards (3 megacredits per card) and actually playing them (which can cost anything between 0 to 41 megacredits, depending on the project). Standard Projects are always available to complement your cards.&#10;&#10;Your basic income, as well as your basic score, is based on your Terraform Rating (starting at 20), which increases every time you raise one of the three global parameters. However, your income is complemented with your production, and you also get VPs from many other sources.&#10;&#10;Each player keeps track of their production and resources on their player boards, and the game uses six types of resources: MegaCredits, Steel, Titanium, Plants, Energy, and Heat. On the game board, you compete for the best places for your city tiles, ocean tiles, and greenery tiles. You also compete for different Milestones and Awards worth many VPs. Each round is called a generation (guess why) and consists of the following phases:&#10;&#10;1) Player order shifts clockwise.&#10;2) Research phase: All players buy cards from four privately drawn.&#10;3) Action phase: Players take turns doing 1-2 actions from these options: Playing a card, claiming a Milestone, funding an Award, using a Standard project, converting plant into greenery tiles (and raising oxygen), converting heat into a temperature raise, and using the action of a card in play. The turn continues around the table (sometimes several laps) until all players have passed.&#10;4) Production phase: Players get resources according to their terraform rating and production parameters.&#10;&#10;When the three global parameters (temperature, oxygen, ocean) have all reached their goal, the terraforming is complete, and the game ends after that generation. Count your Terraform Rating and other VPs to determine the winning corporation!&#10;&#10;",

There is no elimination, that is, who enters the game stays until the end and everyone has a chance to win.&#10;&#10;Butim is a card game that tells the story of the Bloody Islands Archipelago. These islands were used by generations of pirates to hide the biggest secrets that sailed the 7 seas. But all the pirates who buried their treasures there, also armed the most terrible traps so that these treasures stay properly protected. It was a beautiful and deadly place. However, as every story has an end, on a beautiful day a mysterious maelstrom opened near the islands and is leaching the islands with all this wealth to the bottom of the ocean. The objective of the game is to remove as many treasures as possible from these islands before they vanish forever. The player who has more wealth at the end of the game is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;During the game you draw resources and cards, dig the islands (draw island cards) looking for maps and treasures and play special cards. At the end of a round cards are removed from the islands to the maelstrom. The game ends when a number of islands were totally removed.&#10;&#10;",

Do you build provinces, raise armies, and conquer barbarians or build ports and ships to gain trade goods? Explore the strategies of Greece, Phoenicia, and Rome as you erect monuments, fend off disasters, and strive to feed your people.&#10;&#10;Roll Through the Ages: The Iron Age gives players different ways to build their empires: the Trade and Naval strategies of the Phoenicians, the conquests of Alexander the Great, and the engineering prowess and gradual absorption of new provinces by the Roman Republic.&#10;&#10;Some copies of the game include the Roll Through the Ages: The Iron Age &#226;&#128;&#147; The Mediterranean Expansion in the base game box. The only indication of this was a sticker on the shrink that read &quot;MED expansion&quot; (and those boxes are heavier).&#10;&#10;The Mediterranean expansion adds overseas settlements to the mix via a central pegboard that all players share. Players race to reap the benefits of strategic colonies: Crete for fleets; Spain for mining; Carthage for wheat; Gaul for armies; while Syracuse, the home of Archimedes, and Alexandria provide vital innovations.&#10;&#10;The Mediterranean expansion is now available separately from Eagle Games, or as part of a new edition of the game. When sold on its own, the expansion does not contain rules or the updated score pads that include expansion scoring.&#10;&#10;",

Play at home with children, in the company, at school and use it in STEM additional education.&#10;&#10;Welcome to the Battle of Golems! Algorythmus archmage by Cybertania&rsquo;s king&rsquo;s order created Golems - clay robot warriors using coal as fuel. Due to the magic crystal in its head Golem can follow commands and perform short series of them called Programs. King also ordered to build a special field, which would be used for battles between warrior programmers and their Golems. You will take part in the tournament and prove that you&rsquo;re the best robot engineer of Cybertania.&#10;&#10;In 10 rounds each player set up the Program for his Robot-Golem from Action cards and executes it. The Damage tokens and Cards of Fortune will show you how many rounds and lives remain before the victory and whether you can apply Cycles, Conditions or other Bonuses when writing the Program.&#10;&#10;You and your opponents in each round usually have four programming slots (depending on the type of Golem), so you need to take care of a short but effective algorithm. You can use both ready-made scenarios (more then 10+ including in Scenario book) and create your own rules, fields, and actions!&#10;&#10;Equipment:&#10;&#10;&bull; 5 two-sided (summer-winter) board pieces: (4 3x3 sizes and 1 4x4 size) (Print&amp;Play includes only 1 4x4 size)&#10;&bull; 4 Golems figures &#10;&bull; 6 two-sided golem cards&#10;&bull; 76 action cards&#10;&bull; 12 Damage tokens for 4 players&#10;&bull; 22 two-sided obstacle (barriers) tokens + 8 logic tokens&#10;&bull; 40 fortune cards&#10;&bull; 3 Bots program cards&#10;&bull; Scenery book.&#10;&bull; Game rules.&#10;&#10;",

The player who could tap the 4 can choose a piece (out of two cards), steal another and gets the mailman. He/she also decides in which direction the cards are given in the next round.

        "description": "Big Time Hoops is a fast-playing, card-based simulation of professional basketball for two players. To recreate the flow of the game and remove &quot;housekeeping&quot; altogether, the game eschews individual cards for basketball players and focuses exclusively on the major action elements of the sport.&#10;&#10;In general, you'll hold a hand of three cards, most of which will be offensive in nature. You'll play one of them, choosing to pass the ball or drive to the basket; each card will result in a shot attempt with a varying degree of success. Then you'll roll a die. If the shot fails, the card states which side gets the rebound. (Yes, three-point shots are in the game.)&#10;&#10;Your opponent can play a defensive card, and when used wisely he'll steal a pass, block a shot or foul your shooter.&#10;&#10;Simulating realistic scoring requires a delicate balance in a sport where each team averages 100 points per game. Rest assured that you'll find it here, as the number of two-pointers, three-pointers and foul shots will be very close to their actual real-life averages each and every game.&#10;&#10;Playable in an hour, Big Time Hoops will provide all the fun and excitement of real pro basketball -- without the high ticket prices!&#10;&#10;",

If a player closes his hand, the fun is over!&#10;Joker and Doubler help you while foreign Hi-Jacks poach in their own ranks and make seemingly safe points to nothing.&#10;Turbulent, exciting and fast it goes on here - can you keep up?&#10;&#10;excerpt of the official rules: &#10;Each player receives 3 cards on hand. 3 more cards are placed side by side for all players on the table.&#10;The remaining cards form a draw pile deck. The players try to collect as many points in a same suit (red, green or black).&#10;During the game the player's hand can gradually optimized with the table cards. In each round, each player has exactly one of several possible actions. &#10;Note: During the game each player always has 3 cards in hand and on the table are always 3 cards open. &#10;The game is played over several singles matches. The player with the lowest result at the end of a single match, loses a credit (chip card is rotated accordingly). &#10;The player is completely out of the game if he can not bring this stake. &#10;Note: If several players at the same time have the lowest result (tied), each of these players lose a credit.&#10;&#10;&#10;            &#10;        &#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Willkommen in Grim-City / die Stadt der skurrilen Pers&ouml;nlichkeiten&#10;Es ist ganz einfach: Sammle m&ouml;glichst viele Punkte in einer gleichen Farbe, dann bist Du gut angesehen.&#10;Optimiere Dein Blatt so schnell es geht. Macht ein Spieler dicht, ist Schluss mit lustig!&#10;Joker und Doppler helfen Dir, w&auml;hrend fremde Hi-Jacks in den eigenen Reihen wildern und sicher geglaubte Punkte zunichte machen.&#10;Turbulent, spannend und schnell geht es hier zu - kannst Du mithalten?&#10;&#10;Auszug des offiziellen Regelwerks:&#10;Jeder Spieler erh&auml;lt 3 Karten auf die Hand. 3 weitere Karten werden f&uuml;r alle Spieler offen nebeneinander auf den Tisch ausgelegt. &#10;Die restlichen Karten bilden einen verdeckten Nachziehstapel. &#10;Die Spieler versuchen m&ouml;glichst viele Punkte in einer gleichen Spielfarbe zu sammeln (rot, gr&uuml;n oder schwarz). &#10;Mit den ausliegenden Karten werden die eigenen Handkarten nach Bedarf im laufenden Spiel nach und nach&#10;optimiert. Pro Runde hat jeder Spieler immer genau eine von mehreren m&ouml;glichen Aktionen zur Verf&uuml;gung.&#10;Hinweis: W&auml;hrend des Spiels hat jeder Spieler immer 3 Karten auf der Hand und auf dem&#10;Tisch liegen immer 3 Karten offen aus.&#10;Das Spiel wird &uuml;ber mehrere Einzelspiele gespielt. Der Spieler mit dem schlechtesten Ergebnis eines&#10;Einzelspiels verliert einen Credit (Chipkarte wird entsprechend gedreht). Der Spieler ist ganz aus dem&#10;Spiel, wenn er diesen Einsatz nicht mehr bringen kann. &#10;Hinweis: Haben mehrere Spieler zeitgleich das&#10;schlechteste Ergebnis (punktgleich), verliert jeder dieser Spieler einen Credit.&#10;&#10;",

In this exciting strategy game, however, one must call for divine help as conquering the ocean is nothing compared to holding it&hellip;&quot;&#10;&#10;Each almirante has the goal of dominating the ocean, that is, conquering and holding the field in the center of both ocean and board. For that, he or she builds and sails a fleet of both fishing boats and war galleons, by cleverly using the resources received in the beginning of each play: winds and coins. In addition, each almirante has three opportunities to use a god card.&#10;&#10;Each play starts by receiving 6 winds and a variable amount of coins. Winds allow you to move your vessels: you need 1 wind to sail a fishing boat to another field, and 2 winds to do the same with a heavier galleon. Coins allow you to build new vessels: fishing boats cost you 2 coins, while galleons cost you 8 coins. You can trade these two resources, if you are willing to pay a conversion fee.&#10;&#10;You then move your vessels. Sail your fishing boats to the shoal fields to fish and earn coins on your next turns (2 coins per each of the 6 shoals players compete for). Sail your galleons to meet opponent vessels in order to fight battles, or go for the center to conquer it. Battles are always won by the almirante with the most galleons on that field. Some defeated vessels are sunk and some of them may flee.&#10;&#10;If the time is right, call upon the gods! Each almirante chose 3 god cards from equal pools of 8 before the game started, kept them secret and can now play each of them once - but only once. Play Aeolus and he will grant you extra winds, or maybe play Ares and he will sink an opponent's vessel...&#10;&#10;Your play is now over. Are your galleons dominating the center of the ocean? Good, then slide one point along the scoreboard. Do this 4 times (in a game with 3-5 players) to win. But look out, the other almirantes are now sourrunding you and will want to join efforts to stop your countdown toward victory. Will they get you?&#10;&#10;&#10;Portuguese Description:&#10;&#10;Enquanto almirantes, no comando tanto de uma marinha mercante como de uma de guerra, 2 a 6 jogadores constroem e dirigem as suas frotas para dominar o centro geoestrat&eacute;gico do oceano.

        "description": "Franky is back!&#10;In a secret laboratory, the players try to assemble as many Frankies as possible and then activate them with lightning flashes. Only energy charged Frankies can score in the game.&#10;Not every Franky is the same, the risky &rsquo;small&rsquo; red Frankies can win the most victory points ..&#10;&#10;excerpt of the official rules: &#10;The object of the game is to win 12 victory points or more. The highest number of victory points wins the game. In case of a tie of victory points a flash-duel (between the affected players) takes place in a special round. Note: Victory point is a funny reference to the fictional character Victor Frankenstein.&#10;How to play: Each game round the player has a regular dice turn with multiple number of rolls. After each roll, any number of dice can be laid aside, but at least 1 die is always required! Dice which are laid aside cannot be re-rolled in this round. At the end of the regular dice turn (all dice are laid aside) the result is evaluated. A lightning flash symbolizes a victory point, but only if the player can assemble a complete Franky in a same color (2 other dice in green or according violet). A green or violet Franky is always assembled with a head and a body.&#10;Note: If you want to achieve a regular victory point this way, always 3 dice are necessary.&#10;Red Frankies: After the player has completed his regular dice turn (all dice are laid aside), all red Frankies are rolled once again. Here the player has gained special chances with these dice. A red Franky can immediately achieve victory points if he shows a flash after the rolling (the red Franky has been activated). Here no assembly with other dice is required because the red Franky is already complete (custom-made). Displays the die (after the roll) again a red Franky, he will be re-rolled again, all other symbols do not help anymore.&#10;Note: If the player wins victory points this way, only 1 single die is necessary. Depending on how many red Frankies the player has laid aside, a lot of victory points can be earned.&#10;&#10;excerpt of the official rules Blue Eyes (included first expansion): &#10;The player can try to score victory points as usual. If he plays a total of victory points that is similar with the number the blue spot die shows, the victory points can be doubled. Note: The player can decide to devaluate any number of victory points to fulfill the spot die (only&#10;complete activated Frankies can be devaluated).&#10;&#10;&#10;            &#10;        &#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Franky ist zur&uuml;ck!&#10;Im geheimen Labor versuchen die Spieler m&ouml;glichst viele Frankys zusammenzubauen und diese dann mit Energieblitzen zu aktivieren. Nur energiegeladene Frankys k&ouml;nnen im Spiel punkten. &#10;Nicht jeder Franky ist gleich, die riskanten &bdquo;kleinen&rdquo; roten Frankys k&ouml;nnen die meisten Siegpunkte erspielen ..&#10;&#10;Auszug des offiziellen Regelwerks:&#10;Spielziel sind 12 Siegpunkte oder mehr. Die h&ouml;chste Anzahl an Siegpunkten gewinnt das Spiel. Bei Gleichstand von Siegpunkten wird ein Blitz-Duell in einer Sonderrunde ausgetragen.&#10;Spiel&uuml;berblick: Pro Spielrunde hat der Spieler einen regul&auml;ren W&uuml;rfeldurchgang mit mehreren W&uuml;rfen. Nach jedem Wurf k&ouml;nnen beliebig viele W&uuml;rfel rausgelegt werden, mindestens 1 W&uuml;rfel ist aber immer Pflicht! Rausgelegte W&uuml;rfel k&ouml;nnen in dieser Runde nicht wieder neu mitgew&uuml;rfelt werden. Erst am Ende des regul&auml;ren W&uuml;rfeldurchgangs (alle W&uuml;rfel sind rausgelegt) wird das Ergebnis gewertet. Ein Energieblitz bedeutet einen Siegpunkt, welcher aber erst durch den Zusammenbau von einem Franky in einer gleichen Farbe (2 andere W&uuml;rfel in gr&uuml;n oder entsprechend violett) gewertet werden kann. Ein gr&uuml;ner oder violetter Franky wird immer zusammengebaut mit Kopf und Rumpf.&#10;Hinweis: Soll auf diese Weise ein regul&auml;rer Siegpunkt erzielt werden, sind daf&uuml;r immer 3 W&uuml;rfel notwendig.&#10;Rote Frankys: Nachdem der Spieler seinen regul&auml;ren W&uuml;rfeldurchgang abgeschlossen hat (alle W&uuml;rfel sind rausgelegt), werden alle roten Frankys einmalig erneut gew&uuml;rfelt; der Spieler hat sich bei diesen W&uuml;rfeln Sonderchancen erspielt. Ein roter Franky kann sofort Siegpunkte erzielen, wenn er jetzt nach dem w&uuml;rfeln einen Energieblitz zeigt (der rote Franky wurde aktiviert). Hier ist kein Zusammenbau mit anderen W&uuml;rfeln erforderlich, da die roten Frankys schon komplett sind (Sonderanfertigungen). Zeigt der W&uuml;rfel (nach dem w&uuml;rfeln) erneut einen roten Franky, wird dieser als Wiederholung erneut gew&uuml;rfelt, alle anderen Symbole bringen nichts mehr.&#10;Hinweis: Sollen also so Siegpunkte erspielt werden, ist hierf&uuml;r nur 1 einziger W&uuml;rfel notwendig. Auf diese Weise k&ouml;nnen beliebig viele Siegpunkte erspielt werden, je nachdem wie viele rote Frankys der Spieler rausgelegt hat.&#10;&#10;Auszug des offiziellen Regelwerks Blue Eyes (enthaltene erste Erweiterung):&#10;Der Spieler kann ganz normal auf Siegpunkte spielen. Schafft er es jedoch genau so viele Siegpunkte zu erspielen, wie der Augenw&uuml;rfel zeigt, k&ouml;nnen die Siegpunkte verdoppelt werden.&#10;Hinweis: Der Spieler kann sich entscheiden Siegpunkte verfallen zu lassen (nur komplett aktivierte Frankys k&ouml;nnen verfallen), damit der Augenw&uuml;rfel erf&uuml;llt werden kann.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "(Version fran&ccedil;aise ci-dessous.)&#10;&#10;In 1944, during the night of 5th to 6th June, paratroopers of the British 6th Airborne achieved three heroic missions that made possible the D-Day Normandy Landings on the East sector (Gold, Juno and Sword beaches). &#10;In Operation Commando - Pegasus Bridge, one player leads the English commandos, while his opponent is in charge of the defending German troops.&#10;&#10;Each turn, on a different battlefield (each ground having specific characteristics), players draw cards (each player has his own deck), can play events, and then an assault begins. The German plays a unit; the English answers with a unit, that must have a Combat value equal or higher than the German unit's, or reach it thanks to boosts. If it does, the German can boost his unit, then the English, and so on until a player stops. A unit's combat value can be raised by combat action cards and tokens (one side +1 Combat, one blank side) taken from the player's tokens reserve and flipped.&#10;If the English's unit is destroyed, he loses one of his 3 Manpower Points (MP) but moves to the next ground (the assault ends, as does the turn on this ground). If the German's unit is destroyed, he can play another one (depending on the ground's size) and the assault goes on. If the English destroys all enemy units present on the ground, he wins the assault and progresses without losing a MP.&#10;&#10;Players also have a pool of special cards, the powerful &quot;heroic&quot; cards, from which they secretely choose one card to add to their hand each two turns. Since heroic cards have potent effects and can't be countered, choosing them well depending on the situation of the game is strategically very important. These cards feature actual historical officers and events.&#10;&#10;The game contains three scenarios, each of which corresponding to one of the three missions that the English commandos had to fulfill this night: the taking of the bridge of B&eacute;nouville (&quot;Pegasus Bridge&quot;) to allow the landed troops to progress deeper inside the land; the assault on the Merville Gun Battery, a fortified area threatening the Landind beaches with long distance cannons; and the bombing of the bridges on the Dives river to prevent the tanks of the 21th Panzer Division from reinforcing the German troops. Each scenario has its own pool of cards (including heroic cards) and different gameplays.&#10;&#10;To win, the English must fulfill his objective (which depends of the scenario), by winning the assault on one or more objective grounds. To win, the German has to prevent the English to reach his goal, generally by bringing his Manpower Points to zero or, in the Dives scenario, by preventing him to destroy two bridges out of four.&#10;&#10;The three scenarios can be played in campaign mode (one after the other) to recreate the historic night. Depending on his results, the English gets more or less campaign points, and when the three scenarios have been played, his total score indicates if the D-Day Landing will be possible or not.&#10;&#10;The 120 artworks illustrating the cards are realistic and faithful to historical documents (uniforms, weapons, locations...)&#10;&#10;---&#10;&#10;En 1944, pendant la nuit du 5 au 6 juin, les parachutistes de la 6e Division A&eacute;roport&eacute;e Britannique (&quot;6th Airborne&quot;) accomplirent trois missions h&eacute;ro&iuml;ques qui permirent au D&eacute;barquement d'avoir lieu sur le secteur est (plages Gold, Juno et Sword).&#10;Dans **Op&eacute;ration Commando - Pegasus Bridge**, l'un des joueurs dirige les commandos anglais, et son adversaire les troupes allemandes.&#10;&#10;&Agrave; chaque tour, sur un champ de bataille diff&eacute;rent (chaque terrain poss&eacute;dant des caract&eacute;ristiques sp&eacute;cifiques), les joueurs piochent des cartes (chacun a sa propre pioche), peuvent jouer des &eacute;v&eacute;nements, puis un assaut commence. L'Allemand joue une unit&eacute; ; l'Anglais r&eacute;pond par une unit&eacute;, qui doit avoir une valeur de combat &eacute;gale ou sup&eacute;rieure &agrave; celle de l'unit&eacute; allemande, ou l'atteindre gr&acirc;ce &agrave; des bonus. Si c'est le cas, l'Allemand peut renforcer son unit&eacute;, puis l'Anglais peut faire de m&ecirc;me, et ainsi de suite jusqu'&agrave; ce qu'un joueur renonce. La valeur de combat d'une unit&eacute; peut &ecirc;tre augment&eacute;e gr&acirc;ce &agrave; des actions de combat et des jetons (avec une face +1 et une face sans bonus) pris dans la r&eacute;serve du joueur et jet&eacute;s en l'air comme un pile ou face.&#10;Si l'unit&eacute; de l'Anglais est d&eacute;truite, il perd l'un de ses 3 Points d'Effectifs (PE) mais avance jusqu'au prochain terrain (l'assaut se termine, de m&ecirc;me que le tour sur ce terrain). Si c'est l'unit&eacute; de l'Allemand qui est d&eacute;truite, ce dernier peut en jouer une autre (selon la taille du terrain) et l'assaut se poursuit. Si l'Anglais &eacute;limine toutes les unit&eacute;s ennemies pr&eacute;sentes, il remporte l'assaut et progresse sans perdre de PE.&#10;&#10;Les joueurs disposent &eacute;galement d'une r&eacute;serve de cartes sp&eacute;ciales, les puissantes cartes &quot;h&eacute;ro&iuml;ques&quot;, r&eacute;serve dans laquelle ils choisissent secr&egrave;tement une carte qu'ils ajoutent &agrave; leur main tous les deux tours. Les cartes h&eacute;ro&iuml;ques ayant des effets puissants et ne pouvant &ecirc;tre annul&eacute;es, bien les choisir en fonction du d&eacute;roulement de la partie est strat&eacute;giquement tr&egrave;s important. Ces cartes repr&eacute;sentent des officiers ayant r&eacute;ellement pris part aux op&eacute;rations et des &eacute;v&eacute;nements s'&eacute;tant effectivement produits.&#10;&#10;Le jeu propose trois sc&eacute;narios, chacun d'eux correspondant &agrave; l'une des trois missions que les commandos anglais devaient accomplir cette nuit-l&agrave; : la prise du pont de B&eacute;nouville (&quot;Pegasus Bridge&quot;) pour permettre aux troupes d&eacute;barqu&eacute;es de progresser &agrave; l'int&eacute;rieur des terres ; l'assaut sur la batterie de Merville, une zone fortifi&eacute;e mena&ccedil;ant les plages du D&eacute;barquement avec des canons &agrave; longue port&eacute;e ; et la destruction des ponts sur la rivi&egrave;re Dives pour emp&ecirc;cher les blind&eacute;s de la 21e Panzer Division de venir renforcer les troupes allemandes. Chaque sc&eacute;nario poss&egrave;de ses propres cartes (dont les cartes h&eacute;ro&iuml;ques) et des m&eacute;caniques de jeu diff&eacute;rentes.&#10;&#10;Pour gagner, l'Anglais doit remplir sa mission (qui d&eacute;pend du sc&eacute;nario), en remportant l'assaut sur un ou plusieurs terrains objectifs. Pour gagner, l'Allemand doit emp&ecirc;cher l'Anglais d'atteindre son but, g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement en lui faisant perdre tous ses Points d'Effectifs, ou, dans le sc&eacute;nario de la Dives, en l'emp&ecirc;chant de d&eacute;truire deux des quatre ponts.&#10;&#10;Les trois sc&eacute;narios peuvent &ecirc;tre jou&eacute;s &agrave; la suite, en mode &quot;campagne&quot;, pour recr&eacute;er cette nuit historique. En fonction de ses r&eacute;sultats, l'Anglais obtient plus ou moins de points de campagne, et quand les trois sc&eacute;narios ont &eacute;t&eacute; jou&eacute;s, son score total indique si le D&eacute;barquement sur les plages de Gold, Juno et Sword pourra avoir lieu ou non.&#10;&#10;Les 120 illustrations de cartes sont r&eacute;alistes et fid&egrave;les aux documents historiques (uniformes, armes, lieux...)&#10;&#10;",

Warfare in the Eastern Woodlands of America was one of raids, ambushes and sudden violent encounters. These are the skirmishes that Song of Drums and Tomahawks seeks to recreate. The French &amp; Indian War is the most well-known conflict of this period, but these rules cover from the time of the European arrival until the mid-1800s. Players will generally control less than a dozen figures in multiplayer games, perhaps more in one-on-one contests.

Thanks to the small size of the models, Bestial Wars battles are going to feel and look epic; furthermore, the limited number of bases in which miniatures are arranged will allow for fast and smooth deployment and movement. &#10;This structure makes the grand battles of Bestial Wars playable with the ease of a skirmish game!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The 21st Century's Explosive New Card Game! Move over Poker, there's a new card game in town! The2101Game! It's an exciting new card game that combines skill and luck with a unique twist to provide the ultimate card gaming experience. The2101Game is a very easy game to learn, and it can be played with as many as 11 players. The pot grows with rapid speed, giving every player an opportunity to win BIG! So if you're feeling lucky get your family, friends, and fellow gamers together and start playing The2101Game. The2101Game caters to people of all different gaming backgrounds. From the avid gamers to non-gamers alike, they all agree that The2101Game is one of the simplest yet most complex games that they have ever played. People who are typically and instantly drawn to this game are people who play poker, spades, rummy, Phase 10, and Uno although just having a general knowledge of cards is all you need to play The2101Game.&#10;&#10;The2101Game is played with two decks of cards minus a 2 of diamonds, a 10 of clubs, and an Ace of spades.&#10;&#10;To start play everyone is dealt 3 sets of cards which are 3 pocket cards (these cards go in your hand and are for your eyes only!), 3 face up cards, and 3 face down cards (which go over above the face up cards). The object of the game is to be the first player to get rid of all 9 of your cards by first playing all of your pocket cards, then all of your face up cards, then finally all of your face down cards. All you have to do is match or beat the card on the pile and if you can't, you pick up the entire pile and must play them all before you play any new cards unless you have  &quot;2101 cards&quot;, also referred to as wild cards. There are 3 &quot;2101 cards&quot; which are the 2, 10, and Ace. The 10 is the highest of the 3 cards. When played, the 10 clears the pile and also gives the player another turn. The Ace is the second highest &quot;2101 card&quot;. It has no special powers but is just considered high. The lowest &quot;2101 card&quot; is the 2. When played the 2, also referred to as the &quot;any card&quot;, starts the pile back low. It can be played on any card and any card can be played on top of it. You can only play your face up cards once you have no pocket cards left and you can only play your face down cards when you have no face up or pocket cards. Pocket cards must be played one at a time unless you have multiples. Multiple cards of the same value can be played together but is not mandatory and suits do not matter. Face Up cards must be played the same way but if you can not beat the card on the pile with one of your face up cards you must pocket that card that you were unable to play along with the entire pile. Face down cards are also played one at a time but once you touch a face down card that is the card you must use. If you can not beat the card on the pile with the chosen face down card you must pocket that card along with the entire pile.&#10;&#10;The betting element is what makes the game more interesting. There are 4 betting stages. First the table bet (this is a predetermined amount to get cards (similar to an ante). Second bet is the pocket bet. This bet is made after the cards are dealt but before any cards are played and is initiated by the person with the highest set of face up cards. The &quot;2101 cards&quot; are what is typically looked for when determining who has the highest set of face up cards.  The third bet is the face up bet. The face up bet is initiated by the first player to get to their face up cards without having any pocket cards. The fourth bet is the face down bet. The face down bet is initiated by the first person to get to their face down cards without having any face up or pocket cards. When a bet is initiated, starting to the left of the initiator, players must match the bet to continue in the round. Players also have the option to raise when their turn comes around. If a player does not want to make the bet they must fold their hand and forfeit any already wagered chips.&#10;&#10;&#10;    Note - once a player puts their bet on the table it can no longer be removed even if the player changes their mind and decides to fold. Betting in turn can significantly reduce the chances of this happening.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Note - When 4 cards of the same value are played on to the pile it constitutes a clear as a 10 would and also gives the player who played the fourth consecutive card another turn.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Your Uncle Floyd has given you and a few of your buds land to grow some recreational crops.&#10;&#10;Inspired by the Facebook cult underground hit, Pot Farm: The Board Game is a 2-4 player competitive farming game where farmers plant high risk/high reward plants while protecting themselves from the Ranger deck. Higher payout crops need higher protection or else the Ranger might come to seize them! Using successfully harvested weed, farmers can buy unique items from a rotating Store to enhance their farms in strategic ways. The game ends when the seed bag is empty. The highest valued farm becomes the ultimate Pot Farm!&#10;&#10;Players draw from the included Hemp bag and place crop tokens on their farm placards. Just planting on your farm doesn't guarantee the crops safety from Ranger Dick and competing farmers! Successfully harvesting plant tokens to your stash allows players to afford wacky contraptions and buildings from the rotating store deck to place on their farms for awesome combos and boosts to their production.&#10;&#10;",

Split your group into two teams. One player starts first.&#10;2. On your turn, draw a rule card. This rule applies to you during your turn. &#10;3. Then, draw a twisted card. Get your team members to guess the word on your card. Describe it. Act it out. Just don&rsquo;t read out the restricted words in the middle of the card. &#10;4. If your team guesses the word, your team keeps that card. Keep drawing twisted cards until your 60-second turn ends. Then, it&rsquo;s the other team&rsquo;s turn.&#10;5. Keep playing until everyone has a turn. The team that has the most cards at the end wins.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "SpeakEasy is a game where players complete social missions. Most missions involve meeting people and making new friends. Others involve competing against your friends in outrageous challenges! Missions are printed on reusable coasters, which fit right in at your local bar, cocktail party, or picnic!&#10;&#10;HOW DO I PLAY?&#10;SpeakEasy is so simple to play, even an inebriate could learn! Here are the rules:&#10;&#10;1. Draw a coaster. Read the mission out loud to the group.&#10;2. Assign the mission to another player. &#10;3. That player has 3 minutes to complete the mission.&#10;4. If they succeed, they win the coaster. If they fail (or refuse!), you win it. &#10;5. The first player to collect 5 coasters wins!&#10;&#10;SAMPLE MISSIONS&#10;SpeakEasy has over 25 missions. Each one is designed to stretch your social circle, and introduce you to new people! Here are some samples:&#10;&#10;Comic Relief &#10;&quot;Target player must make a stranger laugh!&quot;&#10;&#10;Getting Fresh&#10;&quot;Choose two players. The first one to return with a piece of gum wins this coaster.&quot;&#10;&#10;Playing with Matches&#10;&quot;Target player must introduce themselves to a stranger of your choice!&quot;&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Bill Shakespeare is Dead is a highbrow/lowbrow party game for at least 5 players. There are variants for 3 and 4 players.&#10;&#10;Transport yourself back to 17th century England. Ah, the good old days. The smell of feces and dead hobos in the street. The sight of unwashed masses and the complete lack of hygiene. Isn&rsquo;t it lovely? You and your fellow players are members of the King&rsquo;s Men, and you make your living saying pretty words to hundreds of filthy people. Better than digging ditches, right? Well tonight is supposed to be the opening night of a brand new play. The crowds are already gathered in the Globe Theatre, and the only thing missing is your star playwright, Bill Shakespeare. As it turns out, Bill had a little too much pickled herring and a lot too much wine and is as dead as disco. Now, armed with nothing but patches of the new script and (sometimes obscene) scribbles in the margins, you all need to put on a show. Good luck!&#10;&#10;In Bill Shakespeare is Dead, one of Shakespeare&rsquo;s famous plays is split into five short acts. During each act, one person acts as the Stage Manager, and two people are randomly chosen to act out the scene. As they go through the script, the rest of the players will have to fill in missing nouns and verbs randomly drawn from the deck and helpfully shouted when there is a blank part in the script. The Stage Manager chooses which nouns and verbs go where. At the end, you can tally your points and declare a winner, if that&rsquo;s your sort of thing.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Grifters is a hand-building game that has all the fun of deck-building games, without the deck. Set in the Dystopian Universe, players take on the role of powerful crime bosses, building their criminal organizations by carefully recruiting new operatives with specialized skills and directing their team&rsquo;s nefarious deeds. All of your specialists are either in play or in your hand, ready to be used as you command. This unique hand-building mechanism gives you total control of your strategy.&#10;&#10;Grifters is all about stealing as much money as you can from the corrupt government, malicious corporations, and your rival players. Each player starts the game with a hand of six Specialist cards, each with unique abilities. Your objective is to use this team of six Specialists to recruit more criminals, complete jobs, steal from the government coffers and swindle your opponents.&#10;&#10;Each specialist has a special ability and skill. On your turn you can play a single specialist to perform their ability, or you can play a team of specialists to use their combined skills to complete a job. This means every specialist is a valuable asset to your criminal enterprise, earning immediate benefit through abilities and valuable end-game bonuses by completing jobs against the same target. And because all the cards in your deck are always available, you decide how to maximize your play.&#10;&#10;Grifters uses a unique card &quot;cooldown&quot; system to control the use of your cards. On your turn, you play one or more specialist cards into the first &quot;Night&quot; of your hideout. If you already have a specialist card, or a team of specialist cards, in night one those cards advance to night two and push other cards through your hideout.&#10;&#10;When a card is pushed out of the third night of your hideout it enters the refresh area. Any cards in your refresh area will return to your hand at the end of your turn.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the coffers run out of money, there are no more jobs left to complete, or if there are no more specialists cards left for recruiting. End game bonuses are calculated for completing multiple jobs against the same target.  The player with the most money wins.&#10;&#10;---&#10;&#10;The Grifters (1st Ed) was first released via Kickstarter with the following backer exclusives:&#10;&#10;Upgraded player tableaus - A thick chipboard tableau with linen finish will replace the cardstock tableaus found in the base game.&#10;&#10;4 x New &quot;Ringleader&quot; cards - Informants are a new ringleader (every player starts with one of each of the ringleaders) that add an element of bluff and deception to the game.&#10;&#10;With Informants in play, you can play any card face down and take the Informant action.  Any other player may challenge the Informant. When challenged, the active player reveals the card that was played. If that card is the Informant, the challenger must give the active player 2M ISK. If that card is not the Informant, no payments are due from any player to the active player, the challenger steals 2M ISK from the active player and gets to take the action on the card that was played.&#10;&#10;Informants are a really fun addition to the game and totally fitting with the Dystopian Universe.&#10;&#10;A set of these promo specialist cards.&#10;&#10;You are Awesome - Bonus #1: 3 x The Security Specialist promo&#10;You are Awesome - Bonus #2: 3 x Crooked Warden promo&#10;You are Awesome - Bonus #3: 3 x Veteran promo&#10;You are Awesome - Bonus #4: 3 x Underboss promo&#10;You are Awesome - Bonus #5: 3 x Negotiator promo&#10;&#10;",

The little Inuit need to pack up and rush home as quickly as they can. However, their journey back is fraught with many dangers. Heavy snow and strong winds make it difficult for them to find the shortest route back, the ice beneath them could break apart at any time, and hungry polar bears are lurking nearby! Using clever planning and a keen memory, can you be the first to navigate your Inuit across the ice floes and back to the safety of their igloo?&#10;&#10;In Polar Rush!, seven ice floe tiles are placed together on the table to form the game board. On each ice floe are seven different animals or items found in the arctic. Movement tiles are spread out face down on the table. On a turn, a player reveals a number of movement tiles one at a time based on the number rolled on the die. If he reveals a &quot;seal&quot; and a seal is adjacent to his current position, he must move his Inuit to the &quot;seal&quot; (even if it means he must move backwards); if a seal isn't nearby, he doesn't move.&#10;&#10;The floes also feature special characters that can help (or hamper) a player's movement, so with clever planning your movement can be quite successful. For example, if you move to a sled, your next move doesn't need to be to an adjacent tile &mdash; but if you reveal a &quot;crack&quot; tile, you can separate the game board to create a water gap between the floes. The only way to cross this is to reveal a kayak tile.

While zombies are an ever-present threat, other groups of survivors pose a much greater danger &ndash; you&rsquo;ll soon learn that the dead are the least of your problems.&#10;&#10;This focus on battles between groups of survivors is one of the things that sets Dead Meat apart from many of the current offerings in the zombie game genre. While zombie-bashing is a lot of fun, the real horror of the genre comes from the lengths people are willing to go to in order to survive. Dead Meat brings this terrifying struggle to the tabletop.&#10;&#10;The theme of personal horror goes beyond the game&rsquo;s look and feel. The rules set has been crafted as a zombie survival game from the ground up, ensuring that each game has elements of drama, tension, and action that you have come to expect from the zombie genre.&#10;&#10;",

He can't show it to the other players. Each player will use Pathway cards to move around the board choosing every turn what card have to play (they can be steps, bridge or do not move). Every Pilgrim has to look for two item cards shown in his Character card. The item cards are kept in the creature dwellings. In order to gain these cards the Pilgrim has to pay life tokens to the keepers. &#10;In the meantime the Santa Compa&ntilde;a player, secretly, will use its cards to threaten the other players, steal their life tokens and finally convert them to its allies. The only way for the Pilgrims to save themselves is to discover who is the Santa Compa&ntilde;a, use defensive item cards to repel it or finally find the requested cards to open the magical door and escape, reaching Santiago de Compostela.&#10;&#10;Peregrinus is a dynamic and amusing game where luck, teamwork, intuition and strategy are equally necessary in order to discover dangers, find out the correct magical items, leave the enchanted forest before being caught by the Santa Compa&ntilde;a and reach Santiago.

However, 1 of these cards is only visible to their opponents. The aim of the game is to successfully guess your hidden card (1 of 16 characters).&#10;&#10;On their turn, players may ask any 1 opponent how many cards they hold of a particular type (hair colour or face type). Players must answer truthfully and out loud for everyone to hear. As information comes out, players can begin to deduce which character they are (or are not).&#10;&#10;Once a player thinks they know which character they are, they can make a guess. If they are correct, they win! If they are wrong, they are knocked out of the game.&#10;&#10;",

Five dinosaur tiles are shuffled and placed face down in a row on the table. Then in turn, players turn over one of 26 search tiles. If the search tile shows a &quot;trade symbol,&quot; the player exchanges two dinosaur tiles without looking at them. If the search tile shows a picture of two or three dinosaurs, the player must turn over an equivalent number of dinosaur tiles. If they match exactly, that player's dinosaur advances on the track. The first player to reach the end of the track wins.&#10;&#10;In the &quot;expert&quot; variant, a sixth, blank tile is shuffled in along with the five dinosaur tiles.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Did you ever feel like your town was a dead end full of mindless drones? Like you just had to get out of there at any cost? Well now you might be right! LocaliZED is a Zombie survival game set in your backyard. It is a 1-8 player co-op game that uses any map and your imagination to turn your neighbourhood in into Zombified blood fest.&#10;&#10;LocaliZEd is an open-source print and play game that encourages players to customise their game within the parameters of the core rule set. LocaliZED has players use a map of their hometown, or anywhere else they would like to try and survive a Zombie apocalypse, as the board. On this board a few key locations, church, school, police station are set and then players are given missions at random that force them to interact with these locations while Zombies quickly accumulate on the board.&#10;&#10;As the game progresses players draw cards from one common deck that sometimes cause more Zombies to flood the map, sometimes giving the players bonus items and sometimes changing the dynamic of the whole board. &#10;The game is turn based and the turn sequence runs like this: clockwise players may all move once. Then running clock-wise again, from the same starting player, each player must fight the Zombies in their location once only.&#10;The core mechanic that players use to combat Zombies is really simple. In a location that has Zombies players must roll a D6. If they roll a score greater than the number of Zombies they are fighting then they have won the combat. They may now remove Zombies equal to the difference between their score and the number of Zombies. If they roll a score equal to the number of Zombies this is a draw and nothing happens. If they roll less than the number of Zombies then they have lost the combat and they lose 1 life.&#10; A roll of a 1 on any dice at any time means they lose the combat. A roll of a 6 on any dice at any time means they may roll an extra dice and count its result towards their score.&#10; For instance, if there are 4 Zombies in a location and you roll a 5 then you may remove 1 Zombie, because 5 is one greater than 4. If you had rolled a 4 then you would have drawn the combat and nothing would happen. If you had rolled a 6 you may have re-rolled the dice and added the score of the second dice to the original 6 potentially rolling another 6 and gaining yet another re-roll. If you had rolled a 3, 2 or 1 then you would have lost and had to lose 1 life.&#10; Players may team-up to fight Zombies, and this becomes very necessary. To do this they must be in the same Location. All players who are teaming-up must agree to the team-up before any dice are rolled. The player who&rsquo;s fighting (because it is their turn) may now roll their dice once only using their weapons. Then they may roll an extra dice for each other player that teamed-up. The player adds the totals together and combats the Zombies with this score.  Teaming-up allows players to achieve much higher scores. However, the down side of teaming up is that if they lose the combat everyone in the team-up loses 1 life.&#10;&#10;LocaliZED also contains a rather unique mechanic for death. There is no player elimination, instead the dead player switches sides becoming a Zombie and gaining some control of the normally random Zombie deployment.&#10;&#10;All of these missions and combat are driving the game towards the Final Mission. This one of 5 set endings for the game that can only be revealed once players have burned through all of the other missions. Final mission are always much harder than the individual missions that lead up to them but they generally involve all of the players working together to achieve them. Final missions range from hiding till the end of the apocalypse, curing the Zombies, killing the other players, or just out right killing all of the Zombies.&#10;The tone of the game is quite tongue in cheek with a lot of the missions and cards having humorous elements. Every part of the game is designed to leave the door wide open for players really take ownership of the scenarios an in-game elements, with blank cards of every type being provided, the onus being on using your own map as a board.&#10;&#10;The game was written in response to the Beasts of War websites 2014 Halloween game design challenge. Beasts of War then went on to distribute the game as free down load to all of their members.&#10;&#10;",

If a genie is rolled, the top card of the assignment deck is turned over so everyone can see it. Each player draws the number of cards on the assignment card and adds it to their hand.&#10;&#10;When all players are ready, they all turn over their path cards. Players are trying to arrange their path cards so that all paths connect, while trying to make the arrangement of their path cards match the pattern on the assignment card. The first player who does this correctly wins the round and takes a treasure card. The game ends after four rounds, and the player with the most treasure wins.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The Glorious Fall is a dynamic, competitive/cooperative game with minimized luck. It recreates the entire epic lifespan of the Byzantine Empire, from the founding by Constantine the Great to its last gasp (or not, if you manage to keep it intact).&#10;&#10;During play your Dynasty will be given a choice of secret destinies, such as keeping the empire alive, destroying it, or controlling the Basileus through two consecutive Eras, etc., and a number of Byzantine Plot cards to use when you choose. The map consists of the Themes of the Empire, with three &quot;resources&quot; contained in each: people, religious ferver, and commerce.&#10;&#10;The game is won by the family accumulating the most Glory Points by the end of the final era in any combination of three ways: fulfilling your Dynasty's unique, secret destinies, developing the Themes (regions) within the empire, and shaping the empire to suit your purposes while denying other's their revealed plans.&#10;&#10;Your family will dominate various roles throughout the game: Basileus (Emperor), Logothete (Administrator), Patriarch, Strategos (General), or Katepano (control the mobs of Constantinople). Each title grants limited political power, forcing cooperation, but each can seize unlimited political power at various times when Byzantine Plots are revealed and anyone can suddenly seize control of the Basileus' actions, or even the throne itself.&#10;&#10;Roles switch when players reveal plots of various strengths by using Byzantine Plot cards. In essence assassinating the Emperor in favor of their own candidate; misleading an Army sent to defend Jerusalem, convincing it to go to Cilicia instead; or denying the Basileus the power to hand out political favors, instead forcing him to divide the power as your dynasty sees fit.&#10;&#10;Each family (player) has only so much political power to expend at any time, and must choose when to intervene and when to let the Basileus (or another family) have their way.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, the Empire faces Barbarian invasions from its borders, and possible rebellions from within. Players will create alliances that may last or end before ever begun as nefarious plots are revealed. The Basileus may see Crusades or merchant enclaves rise up to restore parts of the Empire or betray the Empire and sack the Queen of Cities.&#10;&#10;",

The path cards form a maze in the direction of the six goal cards, which contain a variable number of gold stones. The action cards are used to hinder your opponent or to help you to repair broken equipment. A greedy troll also lurks in the mine, and you will have to pay him to progress and he doesn't give back any change!&#10;&#10;",

Apparently, when collected in threes, these objects have amazing powers. Auctions bore you, so instead you and your rivals have to agree on how to divvy up each load of artefacts. In each round, three objects must be divided up between two players. Each person takes what he or she wishes &ndash; if the other person agrees! Is it a deal?&#10;&#10;In each round (or Deal), place 3 artefact cards in the middle of the table: 2 face up and 1 face down. Two players must agree on how to divide up these 3 cards. Attention: all the cards must go somewhere; none can be set aside. Cards from previous rounds cannot be exchanged. Negotiations are free and open. They end as soon as both players accept a proposal and say, &ldquo;DEAL!&rdquo;&#10;Once an agreement has been reached, the 2 players each take their share and place it behind their own screens. The player who has obtained the face-down card can look at it (secretly or openly) and put it with his or her other cards.&#10;The game ends with there are no more cards in the stack.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The Supershow  is a wrestling tabletop dice and card game for 2 - 6 players. Supershow is the worlds first UCG, or Unpredictable Card Game, that takes place in the underground wrestling world of the Legendary Fighting Federation. The goal of the game is to hit your finish card for a chance to defeat your opponent.&#10;&#10;The Supershow gives players the back and forth excitement of a live wrestling match using its unique turn structure. Players attempt to build up to their Finish cards by using Lead and Follow-up cards. Once you hit one of your three devastating Finish cards, you will attempt to keep your opponent down for the three-count. If your breaks out of your finish, the crowd's excitement goes up, and the next finish is more likely to end the high-energy match. The simplicity of the rules allows games to last just 5 - 10 minutes, while still being highly competitive and too exciting to just have one match.&#10;&#10;The Supershow also has mechanics for multiplayer formats: three-way, four-way, 2-4 player tag team, and tornado tag team. Each format can be elimination style or first to Finish. This is on top of different match types (stipulations) that are played with no additional purchases, such as escape the cage or submission match.&#10;&#10;With over 90+ players at the Supershow World Championship at GenCon 2017, the Supershow is more than a game you play with some friends; it's a community of players competing year-round to have the bragging rights of World Champion. The founders of SRG Universe are life-long gaming and wrestling fans and treat the Supershow as a wrestling promotion.&#10;&#10;",

Each player chooses one Player Card and then which side they wish to use, placing cubes to mark their initial XP and HP.&#10;&#10;Each player begins with 2 skills, listed next to their initial XP: STR (Strengthyness) and CRF (Craftyness). All players have a starting STR equal to a D4 and a CRF which will differ depending on which card they chose.&#10;&#10;For both STR and CRF, the die rolls will be as stated until you reach a new XP level where they will increase (ex. The Warrior begins with a STR:D4, when he reaches 2 XP this then changes to STR:D5)&#10;&#10;The Sorceress and Wizard can also cast magic spells (their Magickyness). There are two types of spells: those in blue can be cast at any time during an Attack; those in red can be cast during an Attack but the player may not use their STR to help (see Attack below) in the Party Attack number. Only one spell may be cast in an Attack.&#10;&#10;Each player also begins the game with a Special Skill or Starting Spell which is listed at the bottom of the Player Card.&#10;&#10;Attack: Most rooms have a foe in them to be overcome. Attacking is mandatory unless the Wizard uses his Enchantment Spell (in this case the party moves to the next room and there is no attack but the party receives +1XP for being sneaky).&#10;&#10;Each player will roll for their STR value separately and both values are then added together. This is the Party Attack number. One player then rolls for the STR of the foe (as listed in the current room). This is the Foe Attack number. If the Party Attack number is equal to or higher than the Foe Attack number, the players win the attack, slay the foe and proceed to the next room, with each player gaining the Success Bonus as listed. If the Party Attack value is lower, each player takes the amount of HP damage as listed and they then proceed to the next room.&#10;&#10;Order of Play: The players will proceed from room to room, in numerical order, until they reach the final room where they will be successful and live to fight another day, thereby winning the game, or they will be soundly and  utterly defeated.&#10;&#10;This is the 4th in a series of Annual Games Unlimited Holiday Games and is the followup to Gameshop Express (2011), Gameshop Workday (2012) and Gameshop Gladiators (2013)&#10;&#10;",

Gain influence and expand your forces to strategically defeat the opposing faction. You win the battle when you reduce your opponent&rsquo;s health to zero. However, a Battle Commander must be cautious if their opponent is off-initiative. Since Battle for Sularia is a round-based card game, if your opponent is off-initiative, they have the chance to strike back and reduce your health total below theirs and thereby defeating you and winning the game!&#10;&#10;FEATURES/GAME PLAY INCLUDES:&#10;&#10;Multiple Play Modes&#10;With one box, you and your friend can play with the preconstructed 60 card play decks in a head-to-head 2 player game. The two players can then play in our &quot;60/90&quot; constructed format by customizing their play decks with the additional 60 cards provided in the box! If draft play is more your style, one box also supports 2-4 player draft play! An 8 player draft simply requires one additional box. Of course, the game is fully expandable for a variety of casual play modes &ndash; one box supports up to 2 players in casual mode, but there is simply no limit on how many players and formats are available with additional boxes.&#10;&#10;Construction Point Values&#10;Unique &quot;60/90&quot; deck construction system. Each card has a construction point value of 1 to 4 points. Each deck must have a minimum of 60 cards and a deck cannot exceed a total construction value of 90 points. This system pushes the envelope on deck construction and maintains value and interests for all cards within the set &ndash; not just a few select overpowered options.&#10;&#10;Two-resource System&#10;Engaging two-resource system which includes influence and sularium. Influence increases once per round, while each player uses their influence to establish sites on their turn to help build their sularium stockpiles. Sularium is used to deploy combatants, which are used to attack your opponent's sites. The two-resource system in turn provides additional strategies for repeatable game play.&#10;&#10;Round-based Game&#10;Simultaneous combat. The game runs on a round-based system, which allows each player to complete their turn before the round is over.&#10;&#10;",

If a player gets on a tile with an even number of dots, he turns the tile and advances as many tiles as dots show up. If a player rolls an odd number, he hast to go backward and may not turn the tile.&#10;&#10;II. Turno-Lottery: The tiles form a 6-pointed star. The players place their meeple on a tile. If the die shows the number of their tile, they may remove the tile. The first player to remove all 6 tiles of his leg of the star, wins the game.&#10;&#10;III. Turno-Domino: The 6-edged center tile is placed on the table. The players draw tiles and add one at a time to the center tile, till a six pointed star is formed. The first player to use up all his tiles wins the game.&#10;&#10;IV. Turno-Boardgame: The 36 tiles combine to a game board of 6x6 tiles. The meeples start on a corner tile, have to cross the board to any tile on the other side and return to their starting tile, to win the game. Movement is determined by a die. If a player, for instance, rolls a 5 he can advance to a neighbouring tile, that shows 5 dots, or he can go to a tile showing 3 dots and further to a tile showing 2 dots.&#10;&#10;",

The player must carry out the assigned order (of course, he gives them to himself), until the order is changed by the Commander-in-Chief, or the wing/line commander manages to change it by himself.&#10;The possible orders are: STOP, MARCH, ATTACK. &#10;In the historical scenario it will be possible to give two additional orders: MARCH (IN MARCH COLUMN); DEVELOP.&#10;The game distinguishes the tactics used by the Prussian and Austrian armies, with particular emphasis on platoon fire combat used by the Prussian infantry.&#10;Zone of Control works similarly to other games with the exception that the infantry ZoC does not stop cavalry units, but allows the infantry to fire at the moving cavalry.&#10;Movement is identical as in other games in the hex-and-counter system.&#10;The game discerns fire combat and melee combat.&#10;Infantry and artillery fire combat is based on the shooting unit current morale level - it results in a loss of morale level of the fired upon opponent. &#10;Melee combat is based on morale checks: first the attacker checks his morale, if he gets a positive result he initiates the melee combat. Then the defender checks his morale and if his result is positive the attacker checks his morale again (by checking the effects of the lack of success).&#10;Cavalry (except hussars) can only attack in melee. Their attacks are resolved in the same way as infantry melee combat (with the exception resulting from the option to counterattack).&#10;The loss of morale level is indicated with special markers.&#10;When the unit loses morale is broken.&#10;&#10;There will be four scenarios in this game:&#10;Initial &ndash; a training scenario,&#10;Historical - with General Roemer and his cavalry on the map - the rest of the Austrian army enters the map in the course of the game,&#10;Hypothetical 1 and 2 - two armies face themselves already developed on the battlefield.&#10;&#10;",
