Be the first person to complete a route to win.&#10;&#10;On each turn, play one of your roadway tiles somewhere on the game board. You don't have to play the tiles in any particular order, and your route doesn't need to be straight - but over the twists and turns it must eventually create a path joining your color on both sides of the game board. Remember that all players share the roadway system, so try not to help someone finish ahead of you. After playing a roadway tile, draw a replacement and then the next player on your left takes their turn. Only after a tile has been surrounded on all four sides, players may stack a different tile on top of it, changing the route dramatically!&#10;&#10;",

There are 30 different insults spread among the cards.&#10;&#10;The rules contain several variants but the main mechanic of each is to find matching words between cards, shout it out (Cootiehead!) and discard or add the cards to another pile faster than the other players. Variant rules include relay races, shouting out only the compliments, penalties for making mistakes and even drinking games for adult players.&#10;&#10;Other decks in the series, available separately, share the same rules but have words with different themes such as Sci-Fi or Shakespearean insults.&#10;&#10;",

Players assume the role of K&ouml;bes, a waiter who serves K&ouml;lsch (name used to describe beer in Cologne and Bonn). Each K&ouml;bes is his own entrepreneur. He must bring as many K&ouml;lsch as possible to the tables of his guests, that he previously purchased at the bar from the host brewer. But it's not as simple as it sounds, as there are always many obstacles in the way.&#10;&#10;The game bases its mechanics on the well known and loved game Mensch &Auml;rger Dich Nicht, which uses dice to move around the board. In K&ouml;bes, players also use dice rolls to advance their K&ouml;bes around the brewery/pub, but are not limited to just the rolled dice numbers.&#10;&#10;",

That is, at the end of July, when the AGC offensive was historically shut down in favor of supporting extended drives by the flanking army groups, it&rsquo;s possible that, if you&rsquo;ve done better up to then than your historical counterpart, Hitler may authorize a continued and immediate advance on Moscow. You command the German forces while the system directs the handling of Soviet forces.

        "description": "Modern War #19, Sept-Oct 2015&#10;&#10;It was the Chinese scholar-historian Wei Yuan, writing in the mid-19th century, who first formally identified his nation&rsquo;s apparently inescapable cycles of &ldquo;chaos and humiliation&rdquo; (quru), followed by &ldquo;rejuvenation&rdquo; (fuxiang), followed by &ldquo;wealth and power&rdquo; (fuqiang), and then back to quru to start again. More recently, Queens College futurist and sometimes-CIA analyst Dr. Bruce Bueno de Mosquita wrote concerning China that he sees no factors in the present-day environment working to end or deflect that same cycle. It was the shared conclusions of those two men, working over a century-and-a-half apart, which inspired me to design this wargame modeling the military parameters and possibilities inherent in the next phase of Chinese quru &ndash; civil war.&#10;&#10;The likely starting points for such a conflict would either be the collapse of the Chinese real estate bubble &ndash; which is already broadly predicted to be inescapable and will constitute the largest financial collapse in world history &ndash; or the growing potable water crisis. (A third of the water consumed by the Chinese is undrinkable by US standards.) Beyond those factors, or in combination with them, there&rsquo;s also the gender imbalance, the fossil fuel air pollution crisis, the increasingly endemic corruption, the aging population structure, the expanding rural-urban economic gap, as well as the general collapse of ideology and the resultant moral lapse throughout the populace. One, some, or all of these factors may eventually lead to a crisis in China, as so often occurs in history, resulting in a civil war.&#10;&#10;Each turn equals two months, probably starting sometime late in this decade or early in the next. The game is designed for two players, but it is adaptable for solitaire. Each hexagon on the 34x22&rdquo; map represents 80 miles from side to opposite side. Units of maneuver are brigades, divisions and group armies and air corps (in the form of 176 large-size NATO-style counters).&#10;&#10;Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 176 counters.&#10;&#10;",

Reaching a piece of gold it should be brought back to starting position. &#10;After each player's turn the dragon will move segmentally according die roll. A player hit by dragon's head is out of the game - unless he/she can pay a ransom (1 gold).&#10;&#10;note:&#10;likely published mid 1950's&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Around the time of the Civil War and following, the American West was certainly a wild place.   Although it was sparsely populated, many of the inhabitants were desperate and dangerous.  The West had always been home to large groups of American natives, but now had been receiving various undesirables such as cattle rustlers, gamblers, vigilantes, and banditos.  For the most part, those coming West were hungry for gold and were willing to do just about anything to get it.  Many found it too tiresome trying to get rich panning and digging, and instead found it more convenient to steal or kill for it.  As a consequence, it became the common practice not only for nearly everyone to carry a firearm, but also for nearly everyone to use one.  Needless to say gangs, posses, and gunfights were common parts of every day life.  Anybody with a gun had an opportunity to make a name and gain infamy in the great American West.&#10;&#10;It is exactly this setting in which you find yourself in.  You have the option of choosing one of seven notorious gunfighters of the old American West:  Kid Rango, Chief War Wind, Pablo &lsquo;The Pistol&rsquo; Perez, Walter Winston, Raging Arrow, Luther &lsquo;The Lawman&rsquo; Hale, or Little Pancho.  Besides the 7 posse bosses, Gunslinger: Legends of the Dusty Trail also comes with an additional 42 gunfighters.  Each boss and gunfighter comes with their own mugshot and unique battle stats.  With your posse boss, recruit a gang from the various cities to ride out to face your rivals.  Dodge ruthless banditos, determined lawmen, and hostile natives to get to your next gig.  You can knock off the Bank of the Nation, rustle up some cattle, or take on the Union Pacific Railroad.  You can also track down the other gunslingers to collect the bounties on their heads.  The way you stack your posse, the strategy you employ, and knowing when to strike will always give you the edge.  Each boss comes with his own clutch skills that come in handy when the chips are down.  No matter how many times you play, the scenarios are endless and the game never looks the same twice.  The winner is the posse that bags the most gold, even if they end up in pine boxes.&#10;&#10;With Gunslinger: Legends of the Dusty Trail, you get three  distinct games in the Gunslinger series.  You get everything you need to play Gunslinger Shootout (arena style combat), Gunslinger Showdown (mano y mano confrontation), and Gunslinger Roundup (recruit your posse, collect the bounties, and get the gold). Anybody can get lucky and be a hero!  It takes one shot in the right spot.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Overview&#10;What Da Blank is a question-based card game where you and your friends are put in messed up situations and you get to come up with the best or worst answers or stories to make your friends laugh their butts off! It's really a game for friends to have laughter-filled, honest, friendship-insulting fun!&#10;&#10;Rules&#10;1. The player with the least hair will start the game by taking a card form the top of the deck.&#10;2. The player will then read the question to the group,  replacing the blank with his/her name.&#10;3. The other players will then take turns to give their best/most messed up answers they can think of.&#10;4. The player will then pick the answer that he/she feels is the best answer and awards that person the card.&#10;5. The next player will then take another card from the deck and the game continues.&#10;&#10;Win Condition&#10;The first player to get 3 cards wins the game! When a player has won, all cards will return to the deck and the deck will be reshuffled to &quot;reset&quot; the game.&#10;&#10;Minus Cards&#10;If any player draws a minus card, they must return the minus card and any two cards on their hand to the bottom of the deck. That player's turn is now over and the next player continues the game by taking a card from the deck.&#10;&#10;Community Aspect&#10;What makes What da Blank special is that most (if not all) the questions in the game were conceived from the creators' friends! Seeing this, the creators want to incorporate more questions into future expansions by getting crazy questions from the community to make a game that is truly community-inspired!&#10;&#10;",

Variant rules include relay races, shouting out only the compliments, penalties for making mistakes and drinking games.&#10;&#10;Other decks in the series, available separately, share the same rules but have insults with different themes such as Sci-Fi/Fantasy or Shakespearean.&#10;&#10;",

Projects of such significance require the expertise of more than one person, so for each assignment you are paired with a partner with whom to discuss and execute your grandiose plans. Will your planning and collaborative skills be enough to design the most impressive city in the world?&#10;&#10;Between Two Cities is a partnership-driven tile-drafting game in which each tile represents part of a city: factory, shop, park, landmarks, etc. You work with the player on your left to design the heart of one city, and with the player on your right to design the heart of another city. On each turn you select two tiles from hand, reveal them, then work with your partners separately to place one of those tiles into each of your two cities before passing the remaining hand of tiles around the table.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, each city is scored for its livability. Your final score is the lower of the livability scores of the two cities you helped design. To win, you have to share your attention and your devotion between two cities. The player with the highest final score wins the game.&#10;&#10;The game features play for 3-7 players in 20-25 minutes, a 2-player variant for head-to-head competition as well as a solo variant (Automa).&#10;&#10;",

The players assume control of an army faction that can be shaped by choosing troops, characters, and cards that best adapt to their game style.&#10;&#10;Fallen Frontiers is a battle game based on combat squads. The squads offer protection and firepower to the characters. Characters that are the ones that define the game style because their attributes change the characteristics of their squad. In this way, each squad acts differently depending on the character that leads them. However in Fallen Frontiers characters are not superheroes, they are weak and easy to eliminate when they are not with their squad.&#10;&#10;Besides the miniatures that represent their army, players will also have a deck of cards assembled by them. Strategy is not revealed at the beginning of the game, as a player can secretly set up the deck of cards allowing them to change the game style in such a way that opponents will not be able to guess their strategy at first sight.&#10;&#10;The factions and the cards use up resources to carry out certain actions. The main resources are moral and Krithium. Players gain moral by achieving targets and causing losses to their opponent's army while their army suffers as little as possible. Using moral points will make an army more powerful but will exhaust it in the process. Krithium is a resource that must be collected during the game. It is the source of energy that enhances a team's weapons and cards. The player will have an armory, a separate deck where the player purchases equipment, that can be used during the game and consumes Krithium. The contents of the armory is also set up by the player just like the deck of cards.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "It's a presidential election and you need to win the Electoral College. Campaign, fundraise, advertise, and win the swing states! SWING STATE is designed around the electoral college and the strategies involved in winning the 12 swing states during a US presidential election. It is super fun, super suspenseful, and the most realistic &quot;game&quot; about running for president you will ever experience.&#10;&#10;The game can be played between 2 players.  It can also be played between 2 teams, ideally with 2 players for each team. One is the presidential candidate for the red team -- she chooses which states to visit each turn. Her teammate is the campaign manager for the red team -- he chooses where to spend the money on advertising.&#10;&#10;The game begins with a map that reflects the way all 12 swing states actually lean. Pennsylvania leans Democratic by 4 percentage points (based on a historical average of recent presidential elections). That 4% point lean is reflected by four blue chips placed on PA during setup. Virginia, as you can see in the image, leans Red by 5% points (chips). As players campaign and advertize in these states, the chip stacks rise and fall and often flip from one color to the other.&#10;&#10;A big part of the fun is that Swing State is a game that is easy to learn, easy to set up, and easy to play, but has a very rich mix of strategies that change each time you play. There are seven turns before election night.  And what makes this one of the most exciting games you will ever play is that the results of how each state will vote are not revealed until the very end.  At the end of the game -- election night -- all of the campaign funds you have invested by playing cards face down on each state are finally revealed.&#10;&#10;",

And the blocks have it all: their special size is the building block for two exiting games. A haptic and tactical pleasure!&#10;&#10;Kwinty - The Wall&#10;&#10;The players are building together a wall between them. It is all about the visible sides of the blocks. Each block side corresponds to two equal-sized squares and exactly that is what counts! The aim of the game is to arrange the blocks in a series of five &quot;squares&quot; of the same color (horizontally, vertically or diagonally), while at the same time to block your opponent from doing the same. Sounds easy, but it is not - as always when two players want the same thing.&#10;&#10;Turris - The Tower&#10;&#10;Brick by brick the tower grows in height between the players creating on its four sides a patchwork of light and dark blocks. &#10;The players try to create concatenations of the sides of their blocks to the largest possible contiguous areas and at the same time to cut the opponent's surfaces. But be careful: each side of the tower is considered separately and individually evaluated at the end. The better the blocks are set, the more points you will earn.&#10;&#10;",

On each turn, players choose one of three actions: place a track card, change speed, or move. Track cards contain goals, obstacles, and variable slopes. Increasing speed moves hamsters more quickly to the finish lessens control of the hamster ball. Players may also ram each other.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a hamster reaches the finish, when a hamster is disqualified, or when a hamster ball is destroyed. Points are given for each checkpoint passed. Five additional points are given to hamsters that reach the finish. The racer with the most points is declared Hamster Ball Champion!&#10;&#10;",

Over the course of this combat-centered and highly interactive Deckbuilding Game players will build, enhance and expand their decks by recruiting new Minions and buying supporting Weapons, with the ultimate goal of reducing the opponents' Masters Life Points to zero, before your opponents do so to you!&#10;&#10;What makes DoD unique and special is that each card has two sides, one representing the Divine and the other the Demonic aspect or incarnation of any Master, Minion or Weapon you can choose, recruit or purchase. The initial choice of Divine or Demonic will heavily influence the various winning strategies you will be able to pursue, but fear not: There are plenty of ways to switch your cards from Divine to Demonic or vice versa, and building decks using cards from both &quot;Factions&quot; is an option as well... DoD can hence safely be called a game &quot;With a TWIST&quot;.&#10;&#10;The game will come with custom card sleeves which are mandatory to use in order to keep your hand etc concealed from your opponents.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Ball's Chess, also known as CU-BONO (Romanian for &quot;Who benefits?&quot;), is a chess-like game designed by Albert Edward Ball from Wrexham, Wales. He patented the game in 1933 and once again (with slightly altered rules) in 1969. It was described by the Czech game expert Milo&scaron; Zapletal in his book &quot;Velk&aacute; kniha deskov&yacute;ch her&quot; published in 1991. The game is played on a 10x10 square board with 10 flags, two missiles, two 4-jet planes, two field guns, two tanks and two generals per player. |In the 1933 patent, the flags were called &quot;regiments&quot;, the missiles &quot;airships&quot;, the 4-jet planes &quot;aeroplanes&quot; and the generals &quot;commanders&quot;.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to conquer one of the opponent's &quot;capitals&quot;, that is, one of the squares the opponent's generals started on. Today the patent specifications (GB19330001481 19330117 and GB19690023908 19690510) are freely available on the internet so that the exact rules can be studied there. The game has at least as much strategic depth and tactical choices as ordinary chess, but draws are much less frequent due to the specific architecture of the game's design.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Characteristics&#10;With this game I tried to go a step further from what I tried to do when I created Dition, based on the same design philosophy. My intention here was to make a more consistent game, regarding to the formulation of its rules. I wanted the game to have two basic, simple rules. I was concerned about keeping the concept of simultaneity of actions at all times. Some features of GO, such as &quot;once a piece is placed, it can not move,&quot; are not really consistent at all times in the unfolding of the game, regarding the concept with which they were raised. I tried to get rid of all philosophical inconsistency at the time of defining the rules of this game.&#10;&#10;Equipment&#10;&#10;Pieces&#10;The pieces are circular. These pieces are characterized in that each has a range (a circular area whose diameter is three times the diameter of the piece). Each piece has one side painted white and the other black (like in Othello), and each player may chose one side (color) to play (then, the color of a piece is defined only when that piece is placed on the board, and keeps that color has long has its still on the board). Both sides have in the center a gray circle (its just decorative), whose diameter is equal to a quarter of the pieces' diameter. &#10;To tell if a piece is within the range of another, just take a piece and place it over the two pieces. If the piece used to measure is supported by the two pieces, one can ensure that a piece is within the range of the other (and vice versa).&#10;A total of 152 pieces are needed.&#10;&#10;Board&#10;The board has two concentric squares: the peripheral (whose side is equal to 19x the diameter of the pieces) and the central (whose side is equal to 17x the diameter of the pieces). The peripheral defines the playing area, and acts has a neutral piece (&quot;gray piece&quot;). In this sense, the central delimits its range.&#10;&#10;Rules&#10;&#10;    At the start of the game the board is empty. Black plays first. Then both players play alternately. In his turn, a player can do one or two &quot;relocation&quot; moves. If he cant, the game ends, and that player loses.&#10;&#10;&#10;Notes about the terms used:&#10;&quot;Belt&quot;: a group of pieces conforms a &quot;belt&quot; if every piece of the group is within the range of at least two of the other pieces of the group.&#10;&quot;Conditioned&quot;: a piece is not &quot;conditioned&quot; to a player when it is over the board, with his color facing the board, and since the group of pieces that are within its range (regardless of color) do not conform a belt. &#10;&quot;Relocate&quot;: a player makes a &quot;relocation&quot; move when he takes a &quot;conditioned&quot; piece from the board or from the outside of the board, and then places it on an empty place over the board or at the outside of the board.&#10;&#10;",

One day, a masked man appeared before the duke with a warning: that night, when the sun set, the Troll &ndash; Giant of the Forest &ndash; would assail Bergen and carry off the duke&rsquo;s daughters and wealth.&#10;&#10;As the duke, you must hide your Daughters and Riches in various locations around Bergen to hide them from the Troll. For protection, you have enlisted the mysterious Night Watch and allied yourself with the Mistletoe, whose mystical powers can drive off the Troll.&#10;&#10;Night Clan is a fast-paced area control game with a hint of deception. Each player is dealt an identical deck of 13 cards. The players take turns placing their cards, two at a time, on the game&rsquo;s locations. Once all cards have been played, the cards placed in each location are resolved and any remaining cards are used to determine which player has achieved victory.&#10;&#10;Daughters are played face up and will award their owners 1 Victory Point each if they are not eliminated.&#10;Riches are played face down and will award their owners 2 Victory Points each if they are not eliminated.&#10;Trolls are played face down and will eliminate all cards at their location if not countered by a Mistletoe. If succesfully countered they will award their owners -2 Victory Points.&#10;Mistletoes are played face down and will eliminate Trolls at their location. They will award their owners 1 Victory Point if they succesfully counter a Troll.&#10;Nightwatchmen are played face up and allow cards to be moved between locations.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "From the creator:&#10;&#10;A border-less strategy game where players attempt to surround and outflank their opponent(s) without leaving themselves open to attack in kind. No formation can be strong everywhere though, and advancing and retreating can be equally important. Expand around your opponent's placements and leave your options open while closing off your opponent's. Outflank lasts between 30 minutes and an hour on average and plays either two player or four players in teams.&#10;&#10;Theme:&#10;&#10;Outflank is themed towards medieval pike warfare, advancing in formations linked back to their starting formation and attempting to find the weak spots in enemy formations.&#10;&#10;The theme is light since the game is an abstract.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;Starting from fixed positions, players build out formations to surround and entrap their opponent using limited number of actions each turn. With seven actions a turn you can advance or withdraw cards from the field based on the number of soldiers on the individual tiles. You can also use your actions to draw additional tiles or mercenaries that can augment your cards for further costs. The aim of the game is to take four of your opponent's tiles in a four player game and 6 in a four player team game (combined total with your ally).&#10;&#10;",

Listen in as Katie, Tim, and Matt take on the roles of Faery faction leaders and attempt to win the favor of the Elf King and thus secure a thousand year reign for our faction of elf.&#10;&#10;Elf dance is a simple card game that will provide enjoyment for any age. If you are interested in helping this project get funded you can click the little faeries throughout this post!  But hurry you only have four days left before the Elf King grows angry and banishes this game to the planet Thra!&#10;&#10;Objective:&#10;Elf Dance is a 2 to 3 player game. Each player has a Native Clan, determined before play begins. The player&rsquo;s goal is to recruit as many Faeries and Goblins (Faery and Goblin cards) as possible to the player&rsquo;s Native Clan,while thwarting the other players from recruiting Faery and Goblin cards to their own Native&#10;Clans. The game itself is one of the players: its Native Clan is always the Goblin Clan, and the game itself may possibly come out the winner. Each player&rsquo;s recruited Faery and Goblin cards are kept in a pile by the player&rsquo;s side, and whoever has the most&#10;of these recruited cards when the deck runs out wins the game (bonuses and penalties from equipped Enchantment Cards are also counted).&#10;&#10;",

Recruit dragons from the racetrack and fire them up to get them racing. The key to your success lies in supplying your racing team with a stream of support from other dragons on the racetrack. In the end only the fastest racer will be victorious!&#10;&#10;Dragon Racer is a fast-paced card drafting strategy game that combines card drafting and set collection. Compete for cards to fire up your team of dragons and advance along the racetrack. After seven turns, the player who has gone the farthest wins! You can combine two copies of Dragon Racer to play with up to eight players.&#10;&#10;In more detail, each player gets three random level 1 dragon cards and places them face up next to their character to create their racing team. Shuffle the other level 1 and level 2 dragons to create the starting dragon deck. Remove one random upper track tile and one random lower track tile, then place the six remaining upper/lower track tiles colored-side down between the corner tiles.&#10;&#10;On each turn, reveal the next face-down racetrack tile and add its associated dragons to the dragon deck. Assign trophy cards to players according to their position in the race. (Skip this step on the first turn.) Deal each player a number of dragon cards (two + the turn number) from the dragon deck. Players simultaneously draft these cards face down until all cards are taken.&#10;&#10;One at a time, in reverse trophy order (i.e. last place goes first), players take turns racing. During this phase you reveal all of the cards you drafted, then use them to fire up dragons on your racing team or to attack other players. At the end of the phase you may swap one of the dragon cards you collected with a dragon on your racing team. Finally, the players with the most dragons from each racetrack type are awarded an extra boost, moving them even further along the racetrack.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Love Letter: Batman is a game of risk, deduction, and luck for 2&ndash;4 players based on the original Love Letter game by Seiji Kanai. The deck consists mostly of criminals, with Joker being the most valuable card at #8, Harley Quinn at #7, and so on, with Robin showing up at #4 and Batman as #1, which is the guard in the original Love Letter. Your goal is either to hold &mdash; that is, have captured &mdash; the highest valued card at the end of the round or to be the final player active in the round.&#10;&#10;From a deck with only sixteen cards, each player starts with only one card in hand; one card is removed from play. On a turn, you draw one card, and play one card, using the power on that card to expose others and (possibly) knock them out of the round. If you use Batman's ability to KO someone (other than Robin), you score one point, with points being tracked via Batsignal tokens. If you're the final player active in the round or the player with the highest card when the deck runs out, then you score a point.&#10;&#10;The game ends following the round in which someone has seven or more points, and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

With museums hungry for mysterious and exotic artifacts &mdash; and you hungry for adventure &mdash; you start up your own archeology company. Untold wonders await within dangerous jungles, harsh deserts, and wind-swept mountains. Will you gain a reputation as the most intrepid and famous adventurer of all time?&#10;&#10;In Artifacts, Inc., 2-4 players compete to grow the most famous archaeology company. Players roll dice, which represent their troop of adventurers, and place them on cards in order to find artifacts, sell them to museums, and purchase new cards representing their company assets. Players can choose to focus on making lots of money by selling artifacts, having museum majorities, creating the best combination of expeditions and buildings, or searching below the waves for lost cities and hidden treasures. The first player to reach 20 reputation triggers the end of the game, and the player with the most total reputation wins!&#10;&#10;",

Energy is used to ready or move Ships, avoid black holes, engage in Space Battle, and to harvest or deliver Space Beans to Morning Star - &ldquo;the premium intergalactic coffee roasting non-stop shop&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;Energy Guage&#10;&gt; 8e - You may not ready a Ship. &#10;- Use only the highest die as Energy points.&#10;&#10;&le; 8e - You may ready one Ship or dock at the Outpost.&#10;- Use only the lowest die as Energy points.&#10;Always remember the age-old adage: &ldquo;If you ready a Ship, take a sip!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;&gt;Ships are readied at a player's home Outpost and sent out for Space Bean collection and delivery. But space is weird and movement can be difficult in certain areologies. A simple areology index shows how much more energy is required when entering a hex of different types:&#10;&#10;Areology Index&#10;Black Space &mdash; 1e to enter; sip at will&#10;Planet - 1e to enter&#10;Space Haze &mdash; 2e to enter; a sip of coffee upon exit&#10;Asteroids &mdash; 3e to enter; a sip of coffee upon exit&#10;&#10;&gt;But beware of black holes! At the start of every turn, any Ships within a 2-hex (or 3-hex for increased difficulty) radius are 'pulled' 1-hex towards that black hole! 'Pulled' in? Gone!&#10;&#10;&gt;Made it to a planet with a Space Bean on it? Gotta harvest that puppy!&#10;&#10;Harvest a Space Bean from a Planet - 1e&#10;-Ships carrying Space Beans may only move up to 2 hexes per turn!&#10;&#10;&gt;Deliver Space Beans to Morning Star by moving through its hi-tech non-stop-drop trackway!&#10;&#10;Enter an adjacent Black Space hex with an open opposite Black Space hex and successfully move to the opposite hex.&#10;Delivery &mdash; 2e; a sip of coffee&#10;&#10;&gt;Docking a Ship at an Outpost lets you move any one of your Ships 1-hex in any direction at the start of your turn. And some of the old outposts have copper-coil showers, and a shower is a good thing out in deep space. But bear in mind, it only takes entering a docked Outpost hex with +3e to return a docked Ship to that player's supply!&#10;&#10;&gt;Thought you were safe anywhere else in space? Think again! Engage in Space Battle by moving into an occupied hex with +2e remaining! Steal a Space Bean by rolling &gt;3 with the unused die! Force an opponent into an occupied hex, destroy him!&#10;&#10;&gt;The game is over when all Ships have returned to a player&rsquo;s outpost (total win), or when a player&rsquo;s Black Hole has devoured all of the coffee in the cup/coffee pot/french press/espresso machine/device that started the game.&#10;&#10;",

Can you continue their legacy?&#10;&#10;In this high stakes game of ship combat and capture, you are the pirates from this Golden Age, and your hand of cards is your flagship! Seize the most valuable vessels you can, embark on lucrative campaigns, and prey upon the ships of your fellow rogues &mdash; but beware the Black Spot, for danger lurks within! You'll find hurricanes, mutiny and vile curses, and there&rsquo;s not a soul to be trusted. Alliances will rise and fall as you seek to build your fortune. When the last volley is fired and the rum is flowing, whoever pillaged and plundered their way to the most loot earns the title of most &quot;infamous&quot;, winning the Pirate Wars &mdash; and the game!&#10;&#10;Infamous: The Pirate Wars is a game for 2-4 players, played in turns, and lasts anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes. Working from a hand of randomly drawn cards, you capture ships by matching sets of cards of the same type, and by placing those ships &ldquo;in play&rdquo; on the table. Ships are made up of valuable Loot cards that provide you with gold, and powerful Attack cards that help you defend it. Balancing the two is a key strategy in the game. For once in play, ships can be used to attack and capture ships belonging to other players.&#10;&#10;Action cards aid you in this endeavor, and Campaign cards give you extra objectives to achieve along the way. Event cards round out the deck, providing dangerous obstacles to overcome. The game ends when one player has at least 12 cards on the table (across all their ships), and can discard their last card. The winner is the player with the most loot!&#10;&#10;",

The first volume of this series is centered on one of the characters the most known for this epic, colonel Georges Armstrong Custer.&#10;&#10;In this game, three game boards represent the historic space of three major fights which delivers this hero of the western conquest to tribes Lakotas, Cheyenne and Arapaho: Washita (in November 27th, 1868), Honsinger Bluff (in August 4th, 1873) and Little Big Horn (in June 26th, 1876). On these maps, 1 cm represents approximately 200 meters and a game turn represent approximately half an hour of time.&#10;The lenght of this game is 10 turns, it is the time which you have to manage  the 7th of cavalry, the famous regiment of Custer, and allow him to fil his mission in spite of Indians warriors which will oppose you vehemently.&#10;&#10;You can repel the American Indians who threaten your survival? You will try to replay history, but you can also explore new tracks by following the thread of the numerous proposed hypothetical scenarios. The task is difficult, but glorious. One thing's for sure, trust, it is a good day to win!&#10;&#10;",

They may continue playing cards as long as they have fewer than three &quot;unhappiness&quot; icons in play. If they do get three icons, their turn ends immediately, but if they stop before then, they can use their cash to either buy a new card or flip over a card they already own, transforming it into a new, upgraded card. Upgraded cards typically grant more cash and VP as well as the option to flip them back to their non-upgraded side in exchange for an extra one-time bonus.&#10;&#10;If a player gains eight or more VP in a single turn, the player wins immediately!&#10;&#10;",

Each player is secretly assigned a role - Werewolf, Ordinary Townsfolk, or special character such as The Sheriff, The Hunter, the Witch, the Little Girl, The Fortune Teller and so on... There is also a Moderator player who controls the flow of the game. The game alternates between night and day phases. At night, the Werewolves secretly choose a Villager to kill. During the day, the Villager who was killed is revealed and is out of the game. The remaining Villagers (normal and special villagers alike) then deliberate and vote on a player they suspect is a Werewolf, helped (or hindered) by the clues the special characters add to the general deliberation. The chosen player is &quot;lynched&quot;, reveals her role and is out of the game. Werewolf is a social game that requires no equipment to play, and can accommodate almost any large group of players.&#10;&#10;Some versions of The Pact also contain a few promo cards for Dixit that feature art inspired by The Werewolves of Miller's Hollow.&#10;&#10;",

They have a prime suspect, they have a motive, and they know what the opportunity to commit the crime was. Now all they have to do is prove it.&#10;&#10;Using powers of deduction and communication, the players work as a team to eliminate dead leads and find clues to prove who, how, and why. All the relevant clues are available to them to do so. They just won't know it. On top of that, Sherlock Holmes himself is already on the case. Can they solve the crime before he does?&#10;&#10;At the start of Beyond Baker Street, players select one of the crimes to solve, and a number of suspects, motives, and opportunities will be available for the players to convict of the crime. Each player holds a set of clues, but they won't be able to see their own clues &mdash; only those of their counterparts. Each turn, a player must take exactly one of the following actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;    ASSIST another detective &#10;    INVESTIGATE crime scene &#10;    CONFIRM evidence &#10;    ELIMINATE dead leads &#10;    PURSUE new leads&#10;&#10;&#10;Players win together if they can gather enough evidence to make a conviction before Holmes does; otherwise, they crumble under the stress of the case.&#10;&#10;",

Or, if the vote is split, those disciples get 1 piece of corn each.&#10;&#10;Canonisation:&#10;Play ten rounds, each time revealing a new commandment. The disciple who has collected the most corn is made into a Saint and rewarded with the record of all 10 commandments so they can go forth and start their own sect of Heninism.&#10;&#10;It's a simple, creative, funny group game that scales well and plays out in about 45 minutes.&#10;&#10;The cool thing is that while each disciple is competing to have their individual opinion heard and recorded, together, you collaboratively create what is essentially a new religion in the course of a game.&#10;&#10;",

Includes:&#10;&#10;Kingdom Quest&#10;2-8 players&#10;30 minutes&#10;Ages 12 and up&#10;&#10;Summary: Players start with an Emperor (representing themselves and their realm) and are given a hand of cards from which they must draft/recruit new champions to their Kingdom. Points are obtained through a combination of melding sets (identical champions from multiple realms), runs (a string of champions from the same realm), collecting Kingdom Cards (champions from your own realm), and completing specialty Quests.&#10;&#10;&#10;Control &amp; Chaos&#10;3-8 Players&#10;45-90 minutes&#10;Ages 12 &amp; up&#10;&#10;Summary: A 3-suited, trick-taking card game where players earn points for successfully completing their bids. After 5 hands, the game ends and the player with the most points wins! Can you maintain Control or will the four Chaos Cards disrupt your play?&#10;&#10;&#10;Scourge&#10;2-6 Players&#10;45 minutes (full game); 15 minutes per round&#10;Ages 8 and up&#10;&#10;Summary: Players start with an identical hand of cards (their kingdom's champions) and simultaneously bid on cards revealed from the Scourge Deck. High cards win treasure cards, low cards win scourges (which have special abilities), and all ties cancel out. When all cards have been claimed, the round ends and players tally up their scores from accumulated treasures and scourges. The first player with the most points after 5 rounds is the winner.&#10;&#10;&#10;Redemption&#10;3-8 players&#10;20 minutes&#10;Ages 8 and up&#10;&#10;Summary: Players take turns guessing how many cards of each suit are held by all players. When another player believes someone has guessed too high, that player may challenge the acting player. When a challenge is made, the loser must continue playing with one of his cards facing toward his adversaries. New hands are drawn with successively less cards dealt out each round. The last player to still hold cards is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

When you move from one cube to another, you rotate the cube you are leaving, rotating it in the direction you are moving. If you rotate the cube you just left to the neutral color or your dragon&rsquo;s color, you get to move your dragon again. In this way, the mottled board slowly becomes green when the green dragon moves, then becomes red when the red dragon moves. The goal of the game is to be the first dragon to score 100 points. Points are scored when you are done moving for your turn. Each cube with your color face up at the end of your turn counts as a point, whether you landed on it this turn or not.&#10;&#10;",

Or perhaps you are Prince Pelathar, heir to the throne of Sommerlund. Or maybe you are the infamous Giak warrior Kootak, sent by the Darklords to raze the land. Now you can be all of these... in a hand-painted (by Gary) tabletop wargame.&#10;&#10;Battle for Magnamund is a fantasy wargame for two or more players. Each battle pits good against evil, and players may control either an entire army or a single brigade on one side at a time.  The goal is to allow you to re-create any battle or scenario from the classic Lone Wolf books, and the game comes with pre-made scenarios to start you on your way.&#10;&#10;The core game set consists of flat cardboard figures (3 mm thick and die-cut) in a plastic base, played on card maps that are grid-based and modular.  The maps are the same material as in Cry Havoc, a previous (and popular) game of Gary's. In addition to being fun, Battle for Magnamund is a showcase for Gary Chalk's inimitable 2-D artwork: all components are illustrated by hand.&#10;&#10;",

Just throw the dice and let luck decide in which space you&acute;ll end up. Some spaces have rewards while others punishments.&#10;&#10;There was another Ralston&acute;s TMNT cereal box board game called &quot;Adventures Under Turtleopolis&quot; that came out during the same time, that featured amazing art with TMNT thematic enemies and elements such as the Technodrome and sewers.&#10;&#10;",

At the start of the game, each player chooses a class deck and a race deck, then shuffles them together to create unique character combinations, such as a Human Paladin or Goblin Druid. Each combination creates unique tactics and strategies to use when you battle.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to defeat your opponent by reducing them to zero life. Players do this by playing moves that act as both attacks and blocks as well as with special cards and abilities granted by the player's choice of class and race.&#10;&#10;During a turn, a player adds cards to their &quot;aggression pile&quot;, then chooses how many cards to draw from their aggression pile into their hand. The player uses the aggression provided by the cards that remain in their aggression pile to play move cards to block incoming enemy attacks. If an attack isn't blocked, the player takes damage, specifically one damage per unblocked enemy attack. Then all the moves played by that player become attacks for the opponent to deal with on the opponent's next turn. There's more to it than that, but those are the basics...&#10;&#10;",

You compete with other gemcutters to amass the most valuable collection of gems.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with a single random gem and the communal Market starts with three random gems. On a player's turn, he or she draws a random gem from the bag and adds it to his or her store. Then, he or she may add one of his or her gems to the Market to gain extra actions equal to the gem's value. The gems are valued 1-5, in order from least to greatest: amber, jet, emerald, ruby, and diamond. Then, that player takes 1 action (in addition any extra actions gained) in which he or she may: trade a gem with the Market, shape a gem, or add another gem to the Market.&#10;&#10;When a player trades in a gem, he or she may take other gems from the Market less than or equal to the traded gem's value plus one. For example, if a ruby (value 4) is traded in, it is worth 5 and may be used to trade for a diamond (value 5), an emerald (value 3) and jet (value 2), and many other combinations based on what is available in the Market.&#10;&#10;When a player shapes a gem, he or she places it on any of the three appropriate Shaping Tracks on the player aid. A gem may be Polished, then given a Fancy cut, then a Brilliant cut. A gem cannot be given a Fancy cut until it has been Polished and cannot be given a Brilliant cut until it has been given a Fancy cut. Polished gems are worth twice as many points at the end of the game. Fancy cut gems are worth triple and Brilliant cut gems are worth quadruple their values. However, it takes a number of turns equal to its value to be shaped. For example, an emerald (value 3) takes 3 turns to make an uncut gem into a Polished gem. Therefore, the more the points, the longer it takes to shape it.&#10;&#10;When the last gem is taken from the bag, the current player finishes his or her turn and then the game proceeds to scoring. The player with the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Person, Place, Thing... is the quick thinking name game in which 2 or more players, 6 years and older, race to be the first to call out an acceptable answer to the category starting with a given letter. The game consists of a deck of 50 cards, and the object of the game is to finish with the most cards.&#10;&#10;To begin play, the deck is shuffled thoroughly and placed face up in a pile on the playing surface. Designate a dealer who will read the categories and starting letters for the first round. The dealer reads aloud the category on the top card and then places it next to the deck to reveal the letter on the next card. Players race to call out an answer to the category starting with the letter revealed on the next card. The first player to call out an acceptable answer wins the first card. In the event of no answer or a tie, the card is set aside and the next winner of a card wins both cards. Play continues until all but the last card has been won. The player with the most cards wins.&#10;&#10;Note: This is not the same as Name That...!

The player that gets the most money will win the game.&#10;&#10;In this game, there are two customers on the table and they need some goods such as shoes, clothes, etc.  Each player has three cards and on their turn must choose one of three actions:&#10;&#10;1. Play cards: You can play up to three cards, face-down, so you can bluff. If somebody think you are bluffing, they may call &quot;check&quot; and reveal all of your cards this turn. If they called your bluff correctly, you must pay them $100 per card, otherwise they pay you $100 per card.&#10;&#10;2. Finish a sale: If you think most cards on a customer are correct, you can finish the set and sell them. If most cards are correct, you can earn lots of money. On the other hand, if most cards are incorrect, you have to pay money back to the customer.&#10;&#10;3. Change your cards: pay $200, redraw five cards and keep three.&#10;&#10;This game is very is to learn and play. In most case, if you want to play correct card, you have to trick the other players because they want to &quot;check&quot; you. If you want to play an incorrect card, you have to trick them to sell the product and lose lots of money. In this game, trickery is the most important thing.&#10;&#10;",

Wounds and death are recorded by rotating the &quot;counters,&quot; which are actually folded paper cubes.&#10;&#10;Two maps are provided, each in two sections.&#10;&#10;The game was one of Kaylor and Humrichouser's Games With Depth, which all used folded 3D paper pieces.&#10;&#10;Note: Ramapithecus is today not regarded as its own genus, and in any case lived millions of years before any of the Australopithecus species.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The date: March 1938. The vast majority of Austrians cheer the Anschluss of their country by the German Reich. Central Europe is falling into Nazi hands and all the best European scientists will soon compete under the aegis of Heinrich Himmler, for whom no scheme is too wild or too improbable &mdash; but which team has the imagination, the courage, and the drive to most successfully accomplish their goals?&#10;&#10;Secret Weapons of the Third Reich is a game for one to four players simulating the arms race of World War II from the German perspective. From secret submarine bases in Greenland to the mysterious Base 211 in Neuschwabenland, Antarctica, this game recreates the incredible tales of Nazi technology, from the famous V-1 buzz bombs and V-2 rockets to the unlikely flying saucers derived from the work of Nikola Tesla. Will players be able to deliver the Haunebu project to completion? Will Hans Kammler escape with his last battalion of flying saucers to the dark side of the moon? Will the secret submarine fleet sail to Antarctica to pursue the war after the war? Or could German scientists produce an atomic bomb to be dropped on New York by an electro-gravitational flying saucer or within the warhead of a futuristic intercontinental V-3? Would it even be possible to build a huge solar satellite gun to strike America?&#10;&#10;In the game, each player controls one or more research groups, each working on a secret weapon project. Each research group has a leading researcher, who provides an initial bonus (expressed in resource cubes or scientist cylinders) when the project is assigned. The researcher has a regime loyalty value that measures both the ability to make requisition attempts and the ability to resist opposing attempts.&#10;&#10;A player tries to get their projects approved, then completed. Certain requirements (resource cubes and/or scientist cylinders and technologies attached to projects) must be met and costs paid in order to reach the stage of development of a project. Each turn, approved projects generate specific amounts of resource cubes as funding. Completed projects award victory points (VP) and allow, in most cases, weapon production. Produced weapons award VP to the owning player in addition to helping to achieve a cooperative goal for all players. In fact, if together the players fail to reach a certain number of weapons produced by the end of the game, they all lose. The weapon production goal varies depending on the number of players.&#10;&#10;Play begins in 1938, one year before the outbreak of world war. At the start, players can only place research groups for their approved projects (project plants) in the portion of the map representing Germany and Austria. In 1939 and later, the conquests of Nazi Germany allow players to deploy their project plants in occupied European territories &mdash; but players will have to pay attention to the various locations because some areas allow only research and development, others only weapon production, and still others only research and development for U-Boat projects.&#10;&#10;Also, players must operate in a &quot;state of warfare&quot;. This means that as time goes on they are more and more subject to enemy bombardments that can cause a great loss of resources and technologies. In addition, as starting in 1943 Allied and Soviet advances on Berlin make the map progressively smaller, players must face logistical issues never encountered during the early years of the war.&#10;&#10;Should a completed project or produced weapon fall into Allied hands, players not only lose VP, but the weapons production goal recedes as well! Thus a certain amount of player cooperation is a must. Each player must balance his personal interests with the common need to share technologies and resources in order to fulfill the common goal.&#10;&#10;Last, but not least, via events one player may secretly become the turncoat, working in the shadows to help the enemy, and winning the game if all players would otherwise lose.&#10;&#10;",

Each enemy has 3 lives (Bases) and if you&rsquo;re the last Bomber standing with 1 or more Bases at the end of any turn - you WIN! But, there&rsquo;s a twist: the cards you play don&rsquo;t have to be actual bombs! You can bluff your way to military supremacy with a non-Bomb card to try and get your opponents to waste their valuable resources. War is hell, and all&rsquo;s fair in love and KaBlooey!&#10;&#10;",

Connect same colored railways. If you draw a train card, you can play one more time. Tunnel cards and storm cards can be drawn anytime. Only a dice knows what will happen when a storm card is drawn.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, they can play a card that connects to a similar color rail card on the table. Alternatively, if they are not able or don't want to do that action, they may draw a card.&#10;&#10;The first player to empty their hand of cards wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

If two or more players want to race the same horse, players draw which player gets to race the horse of choice.&#10;Horse 1-4 starts on starting-line 1, and horse 5-8 on starting-line 2.

You have to pass horses by changing the track and pass on the inside or outside. It's only allowed to change track acording to the arrows on the gameboard. So sometimes you'll be blocked from using a good die-roll.&#10;&#10;Around the track you'll find spots in diferent colors. Each color have their own special-effect.&#10;Yellow: Double-spot.&#10;Red: Miss the next move, and other horses may pass in the same track (there may be two horses in the red spot).&#10;Green: Double the amount of your next die-roll.&#10;Blue: Use only one die next die-roll.&#10;Black: At the next die-roll, move forward only if getting dice of same value. Unless two-of-a-kind, move backwards in the same track according to the die-roll (you are not limited by other horses behind you).&#10;&#10;The first player to pass the goal-line after two rounds wins the race and receives the money in the pot and from each player the same amount of money the winning player put on his horse before the race.

By yourself you might be able to get through the crowd, but it's either all of you or none of you...that was the deal.&#10;&#10;In Dead Things, the players need to work together to play against the game. Turn order and movement is controlled by a movement deck and the board is set up so that zombies appear in a programmed order, moving ahead of you if your characters move too slow.&#10;&#10;The goal is to find gas, and car keys and leave the board before the zombies overwhelm the party.&#10;&#10;Dead Things 3rd Edition is a board game that expands on the original Dead Things game. New maps, new challenges for 1-4 players.&#10;&#10;",

A unique aspect to Taudelon Station is that these modifications change the game for all of the players, not just for the players who own the modules.&#10;&#10;Players&rsquo; hands come from a deck of cards that has five suits, numbered 1 to 9. Players will either play a combination of at least two cards that equal exactly 10 to create a resource (called Elements), or they will play a combination of cards similar to the various types of Poker hands (pair, full house, etc.) to create the currency (called Energy) that works with the resources to let players build the modules.&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, unidentified aliens are swarming around the station, and while the game is fully competitive, the players all must defend the station against the aliens or everyone loses.&#10;&#10;",

Although this game claims to be &quot;Golf game of the year,&quot; the golf theme seems entirely pasted on. Players roll dice and try to move their pieces (or &quot;tees&quot;) out of their tee box, along the track, to their green and then into their hole.  There is a special &quot;Mulligan's Wild&quot; die included, which allows players to move a number of spaces of their choice. First player to move all tees onto the matching green and into the matching hole wins.&#10;&#10;",

Racers use their stamina, shift gears, make use of abilities like 'drafting' and 'sprinting' and strive to reach to the finish line first. The game makes use of unique mechanics like card interlocking, sliding and rotating cards, 3D like vertically folded racer cards to fit a fairly complex but tactical game in just 18 cards. The race is played on a track made up of 6 'track cards' which are either flat sections or climbs and descends of different gradients. Double sided track cards allow for a second more difficult track to be made from the backs of the cards giving replay ability to the game. There are 2 racers to chose from while they each have their own special abilities the other one does not have. You can play a big game of 3 laps or a short filler of 1 lap, so immerse yourself in the world of bike racing, micro style!&#10;&#10;",

Can you do it?&#10;&#10;Flatten out Monsters is a new type of memory game in which you need to memorize only six cards! Can you effectively lead the heroes and flatten out the monsters?&#10;&#10;To set up, monster cards are placed in a 3x7 grid and double-sided hero cards are placed in a 3x2 grid in front of the monsters. Heroes in the same line &mdash; that is, a line of two hero cards &mdash; will fight the seven monsters lined in front of them. On a player's turn, he must swap two hero cards, then flip them to the reverse sides. These two cards activate the cards in the same line with them and become the attacking groups, then you resolve the attack on the monsters one by one in each activated line. If the two hero cards show the icons needed to defeat the first monster in line, they win the fight and score the monster card. Then they fight against the second monster, and so on until they fail. Play continues in clockwise order until at least two lines of monsters are all defeated, and whoever has the most monster cards wins!&#10;&#10;",

After all Snail and Flower cards are placed, players check who controls each Flower cards by adding the values on their Snail cards.

Only one will be remembered as the conqueror of the North Pole. If you think you can adapt the ever-changing harsh conditions better than the others, start gearing up &mdash; the race is on!&#10;&#10;In Race to the North Pole each player has an expedition team which they have to navigate to the North Pole on the middle of the game board. The first player to get all of his or her pawns there wins the game. Game is played by moving with cards that are in front of you. Some cards allow movement while others also ambushing other players. But ambushing has a price! When ever you tackle another player you have to grab an &quot;Ice Mask Tile&quot;, which include equipment and some nasty hazards that might ruin your well planned schemes.&#10;&#10;Race to the North Pole also features a unique rotating board that simulates the Arctic weather. When a storm hits the board, everything changes! Your movement cards travel on the board and you receive a new set, the arctic maze that is formed out of cracks changes completely and the players travel around the board with the weather. This design has deep strategical elements that make every playthrough exciting and challenging to the very end.&#10;&#10;The game includes a free app Dized that gives players loads of new content, localizations, and mechanisms to use with the game through their smart devices.&#10;&#10;",

Three stacks of poker-style chips with answers to multiplication tables printed on them are placed in the center of the table. Each player is dealt five cards with single-digit numbers. Each player in turn tries to find two cards in their hand that can be multiplied to match the total on one of the three top chips. The player then captures that chip, discards the two played cards, and draws two new cards. They player may then try to capture another chip (up to three per turn). When the player reaches three chips or cannot capture another chip, play passes to the next player.  If a player makes a mistake and plays the wrong cards to capture a chip, the player must put both that chip and one previously-captured chip on the bottom of one stack and pass his turn. After all the chips are claimed, the player with the most chips wins.&#10;&#10;There are a couple of variants which add extra rules, as well as a solitaire version.&#10;&#10;",

Cards are laid out just like a bingo game (5 x 5 grid), but the &quot;free&quot; space is labeled either as &quot;antonyms&quot; or &quot;synonyms&quot;.  The rest of the spaces are words.  The game leader pick a word from the 121-calling card deck and call it out.  Those players with &quot;antonym&quot; on their free space will cover any word that is an antonym of the called word.  Those players with &quot;synonym&quot; on their free space will cover any word that is a synonym of the called word.  Any player who covers 5 spaces in one row of their card - either vertically, horizontally or diagonally, will call out &quot;Quizmo!&quot;.  They are the winner of that game.&#10;&#10;",

In the meantime players can obtain title deeds and chance cards which are worth victory points. The one with the most victory points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

When in battle, each player will use it&rsquo;s army to fight and defeat the Moors and hence contribute to the victory of the Portuguese.&#10;&#10;The players recruit the armies when D. Afonso Henriques meeple is in a circle over a small village in the Portugal&rsquo;s map. Respecting order of play, each player chooses the village he wants to go, in the villages area in the board, and places his cylinder in the available symbol.&#10;&#10;Players can enter a battle when D. Afonso Henriques meeple is in the circles marked as battle. In it&rsquo;s turn, the player chooses one or more Portuguese cards from his hand to enter the fight. He places his chosen card(s) face up in the battle field, in one of the 4 spots available, in front of the Moors card that he wants to fight with. Each Portuguese card indicates in it&rsquo;s lower side the number of dice that the player is allowed to roll. If a Player uses 2 cards, he can roll the total dices resulting from the 2 cards. Each Moors card has in it&rsquo;s upper right corner a die with a value. If the highest result of any dice rolled by a player matches or is superior to this value, the player wins the fight and the Moors card is defeated.&#10;&#10;The game ends after the battle of Ourique (the 5th battle). The player with more Victory Points wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": " As Tears Go By: Operation Starlite is an introductory level game on the battles of US Marines and the NLF in I Corps of Vietnam in August of 1965.&#10;&#10;The Battles of Operation Starlite were the first large-scale fights waged by the Marine Corps in Vietnam. A spy informed the South Vietnamese I Corps commander that an attack on the US Marine Base at Chu Lai by the NLF&rsquo;s (National Liberation Front) 1st Regiment was imminent. The Marine&rsquo;s commander, Lt. General Lewis W. Walt convinced his superiors that the best defense was a pre-emptive attack. He also decided against informing or working with his South Vietnamese counterpart, as past intelligence leaks led to the elusive Viet Cong disappearing in the face of the American&rsquo;s probes and attacks.&#10;&#10;Operation Starlite depended upon the coordination of amphibious landed troops of the Marine&rsquo;s 3/3 Battalion while those of the 1/7 marched from the north to serve as the &ldquo;anvil&rdquo;. The &ldquo;hammer blows&rdquo; would be delivered by artillery, air and naval support strikes, as well as the 2/4 battalion that would be airlifted into battle. It was hoped that surrounding the VC with multiple threats would trap and force them to do battle.&#10;&#10;",

Whoya? is a fun, hilarious way to get to know all about the people you are with and for them to get to know all about you!&#10;&#10;Every round there is a judge that reads the prompt on a Whoya? card out loud. All other players write their response down and turn it in. The reader then selects his or her favorite response, and tries to guess who submitted that response. If the judge guesses correctly, the judge keeps the Whoya? card and earns the point for that round. If the judge guesses incorrectly, the player who submitted the judge's favorite response gets the Whoya? card and earns the point for that round.&#10;&#10;Many of the prompts on the Whoya? cards are crowd-sourced from users who have submitted card ideas. On these cards, the first name, last initial, and location that person is from is displayed in the bottom right hand corner of the card.&#10;&#10;",

Lang.&#10;&#10;In this game, each player fields one of the superhero teams, with each hero &mdash; Rocket Raccoon, Groot, Captain Marvel, Daredevil, Kang and more &mdash; being represented by custom-tooled dice; each team must be composed of 15 dice, and a player can &quot;purchase&quot; dice only from his team. Each hero also has one or more character reference cards, which show the special abilities for the characters based on the die rolls. Different versions of these cards will be available in booster packs, allowing for more customization of your team. Players use these dice to collect energy, recruit new heroes, and battle head-to-head. In addition, each player brings two basic action cards to the game, which are placed in the center of the table; both players can purchase these cards. A player wins once the opposing player has been reduced to zero life.&#10;&#10;The Marvel Dice Masters: Age of Ultron starter set comes with 44 custom dice, 38 cards, two dice bags, and a core rulebook. Booster packs include two dice with two matching character cards.&#10;&#10;",

You also get points for single rolls of Darth Vader (100 points) or Yoda (50 points).  If you set aside some scoring dice, you can re-roll the others, but if you ever roll without any scoring dice, Jabba takes your points.  However, if you score all six dice, then the Force is strong with you, and you can re-roll all six if you want to press-your-luck.  The first person to score 5,000 points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Additionally, as the token values are fixed for each player, as the game progresses and the board starts to fill, it becomes easier to guess what the other player might be holding, increasing the chance for a strategic play.&#10;&#10;Players take turns placing game tokens (representing the daily clients calling into the office) onto the shared game board, housing them as effectively as possible within the parameters of the rules. The winner is the agent with the most points after each player has placed all their tokens down.&#10;&#10;",

Unlike the blood-craving vampires of Western myth that turn into flying bats, Chinese vampires do not transform and their bodies become stiff. The only way for them to travel is to hop and that&rsquo;s why they are called hoppers (well, that&rsquo;s why I call them that).&#10;&#10;Hoppers is a 4 to 9-player action/dexterity party game for all ages. In the game, players are guardians of the realm and each holds a power stone that gives them the ability to travel into the Mystic Forest. Player must beware, however, because one of the players may be a demon in disguise and hold the evil Hopper Stone.&#10;&#10;Each game of Hoppers is played over the course of up to five rounds. In each round, players attempt to pass a dexterity challenge in the Mystic Forest and only successful players can examine the stones of power. When a player&rsquo;s matching power stone is found, the player has the ability to capture the Hopper Stone and win the game. Otherwise, the game ends in the Hopper&rsquo;s Way and all guardians disappear into the dark of the Mystic Forest.&#10;&#10;",

Each card will give you &quot;black&quot; points (if you are a Monster) or &quot;white&quot; points (if you are a Hero). Also, each card represents a character with a special skill that you can use in your favor. Dracula can control the forces of darkness. Van Helsing can destroy the undead.

There is a total of 18 different characters, in a deck of 30 cards. Some of these characters are unique and deadly, like the werewolf, but others are more common and less powerful, like the brave young men. In addition to this, each faction card will give you an extra point if you have a certain character in front of you at the end of the game. That means that some cards are more useful for some players than for others.&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;&iexcl;H&eacute;roes y monstruos combaten a muerte en las calles del Londres victoriano!&#10;&#10;Cada jugador coge una carta de facci&oacute;n secreta, que dir&aacute; si est&aacute; del lado de los &quot;H&eacute;roes&quot; o de los &quot;Monstruos&quot;.&#10;&#10;Durante la partida, un jugador puede, o bien jugar una carta desde su mano, o bien robar una nueva carta. Cada carta proporciona puntos negros (si est&aacute;s del lado de los monstruos) o blancos (si est&aacute;s del lado de los h&eacute;roes). Adem&aacute;s, cada una de estas cartas representa a un personaje con una habilidad especial que puedes usar en tu beneficio. Dr&aacute;cula puede controlar las fuerzas de la oscuridad.

Once the patient is flipped doctors must quickly determine if they can attempt the surgery using the tools they have in their hand.&#10;&#10;During surgery other doctors can attempt to hinder the procedure by playing whoops cards which can increase the cost of surgery or steal tools or patients right out from under you.&#10;&#10;The length of the game is variable depending on how many patients you want to attempt to treat. This is determined at the beginning of the game.

        "name": "Fallen Land: A Post Apocalyptic Board Game",
        "description": "Set in a post-apocalyptic sci-fi setting, Fallen Land: A Post Apocalyptic Board Game is a hybrid game that combines the elements of a strategy board game, with card building and role-playing. It is driven by macabre stories of a world gone mad and features adventure, politics and economics to deliver an unlimited sandbox experience. Each game the variables change: cards, player interactions, stories, strategies and threats. While the game has a strong pulp influence, its roots stem from Cold War studies. We have expanded upon this research to arrive at our game&rsquo;s premise: What would happen after a nuclear and biological apocalypse?&#10;&#10;Our answer is Fallen Land. As a player, you are the leader of a unique faction of survivors competing for primacy in the ruinous aftermath of post-apocalyptic America. You must manage and enhance your town, protect your citizens and secure resources. You will also have to make and break treaties to endure, amidst a myriad of bribery and betrayal by the other players. But that is just where the adventure begins! You must also direct your agents (a party of characters), to explore the rugged landscape, establish your territory and solidify your agenda.&#10;&#10;Game play is comprised of Turns. Each represents one month and is divided into Phases and Sub-Phases. The First Player resolves each Phase and Sub-Phase followed clockwise by the other players, before proceeding to the next Phase or Sub-Phase. A Turn is over when all players have had the opportunity to act or pass on each Phase.&#10;&#10;I. Effects Phase *&#10;    1.) Resolve.&#10;&#10;II. Town Business Phase *&#10;    1.) Deal.&#10;    2.) Resource Production.&#10;    3.) Auction House.&#10;    4.) Roll 1d10 on Town Events Chart.&#10;    5.) Financial period.&#10;        ~Sell.&#10;        ~Purchase.&#10;        ~Hire (NPCMs).&#10;&#10;III. Party Exploits Phase *&#10;    1.) NPCMs move.&#10;    2.) Choose Party Exploits (4 weeks to spend).    &#10;        ~Movement, spend 1 week.&#10;        ~Encounter, spend 1 week.&#10;        ~PVP, spend 1 week.&#10;        ~Resource, spend 2 weeks.&#10;        ~Healing, spend 2 weeks.&#10;        ~Mission, spend 3 weeks.&#10;&#10;IV. End Turn Phase *&#10;    1.) Adjust Turn Marker.&#10;    2.) Pass the First Player Sheet.&#10;&#10;&#10;    Resolve an Action Card in each Phase or Sub-Phase as directed by the card.&#10;&#10;&#10;A player's town is simulated by a Town Play Mat. Players organize their owned Resources, inventory, Party Characters, excess Characters and movement bonuses here. In addition, Town Play Mats can be upgraded three different ways: Town Defense Chips, Town Technologies and Action Cards. The first two upgrades are available for purchase during the Town Business Phase. However, Action Cards are dealt at the beginning of each Turn and are also drawn as a reward.&#10;&#10;    Players also manage their Party consisting of five Character Cards. Characters may be equipped with gear (Spoils Cards), to increase their Base Skills. A party can move around the map, draw Encounter and Mission cards (stories) which contain Skill Checks (challenges) and even attack another player's Party in PVP. Dice are rolled for these many &quot;deeds&quot; to determine the outcome. &#10; There are seven decks of cards. These are drawn and played throughout the game. Some are stories, such as Encounter and Mission Cards, Characters are a Faction's agents, and Spoils are equipment/vehicle/gear. Lastly, Action Cards modify the story and/or game play.&#10;&#10;To win, one of two Victory Conditions is necessary, either 20 Prestige or 80 Town Health. Prestige represents your reputation as a leader, while Town Health represents your town&rsquo;s prosperity and number of its citizens. Both conditions are marked on their respective Victory Tracks bordering the map.&#10;&#10;Adventure and intrigue await!  We hope you have the opportunity to play Fallen Land and that you enjoy playing it as much as we have enjoyed creating it for you.&#10;&#10;",

Having mined all of its resources, facing a population many times that which could be possibly sustained and slowly mutating it into a massive, cloying, choking city, we had no choice but to set our greedy eyes on the planets around us and conquer new lands.&#10;&#10;After the Information War of the 21st century, the Corporations dissolved national borders and began a new war of their own: the Resource War. Like their European ancestors, who conquered and fought over new land, the corporations started to clash for control of the stars around Earth, as if they had claims to them from the moment of their conception.&#10;&#10;Thus began the new arms race, but this time the lessons learned from past wars would be embraced and used to leverage as much advantage as possible. Research into more advanced abilities to control not only the battles, but the hearts and minds of the people who fight them would become key to victory.&#10;Vanquish&nbsp;is a game of intergalactic warfare amongst rival corporations in Earth&rsquo;s dark future with a near endless number of system configurations and multiple paths to victory &ndash; through the council, through research of technologies and advanced abilities, via the creation of popular utopian worlds, or by the might of your powerful fleets.&#10;&#10;Each player steps into the powerful and all encompassing shoes of the head of one of the five corporations fighting for the control of the universe. You will need to use cunning, guile, diplomacy, deception, and tactical thinking to make the decisions that will hopefully bring victory, control, renown, and respect to your corporation.&#10;&#10;In each round of the game, players select four actions to perform. Players in turn perform one of these. Whenever an action is performed, all other players may also perform that action. The available actions are: Fleet (move ships), Research (develop tech), Council (Create votes on new rules), Planetary (develop your civilization), Energy (generate resources) and Logistics (build new ships). Players score points for colonizing worlds, developing tech, building colonies, passing votes and developing their civilization. The game ends when one player has accumulated 15 points, but that player does not necessarily win, as there are bonus points scored for being the best player in each of several categories.&#10;&#10;",

It focuses on physical contact between participants; testing imagination, communication, and intuition&mdash;An ice breaker meant to challenge social boundaries.&#10;&#10;Players gather in a circle and take turns interacting with new partners.  Each pair finds a way to make physical contact that hasn't already been done in the game. If they succeed, they each earn 1 point.&#10;&#10;Each player receives a quirk card that tells them one way they must behave during the game (e.g. &quot;Avoid Eye Contact&quot;).  If you can guess a person's quirk, you received a point, and they get a new quirk.&#10;&#10;The game ends when everyone has partnered with everyone else once.  The person with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;NOTE: This was game was a submission to the Golden Cobra Challenge 2014.  However, it is much more of a social/party/ice-breaker game than a role-playing game, and has been added as such to BGG with the permission of the designer.  The rules for the game are available on the Golden Cobra Challenge website.&#10;&#10;",

If your agents are in the majority at any given action spot, or you decide to send mercenaries to their help, they squelch the competition there and allow you to take the linked action. Actions include developing and harvesting oil fields, building pipelines, hiring new agents, buying new ship contracts, investing in oil replacement technologies, conducting PR campaigns, engaging in piracy, and manipulating public opinion and oil prices.&#10;&#10;After some time, the oil &mdash; represented by a set number of small barrels you draw from a bag when developing new oil fields &mdash; will run out. This is called &quot;peak oil&quot; and marks the end of the game. Players tally the value of the technologies in which they invested and promoted during the game. Whoever shaped the future best (i.e. gained favor for their company) wins.&#10;&#10;",

The most recent mission went awry and now you know there are others vying for the Captain&rsquo;s ear. You must expose these others before they expose you. Use your guile and wit to &lsquo;take care of&rsquo; the other spies until you are the only spy left to win.&#3;&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;Deal each player an identity card. The identity cards will have a name and 2 roles on it. The roles allow you to do take actions (See role cards for list of actions). You may also bluff to take the other actions, but if another player calls your bluff, you are exposed and you lose (see bluffing on next card).&#10;&#10;Bluffing: When you use a role, someone may call you a liar. If they do, reveal your card to them. If the used role is one of the two on your card, they lose and reveal their card. If you bluffed and got caught, you lose and reveal your card. You cannot lie about whether an assassin or accuser correctly guessed your identity.&#10;&#10;There are 3 green and 3 blue roles. Each identity has 1 green and 1 blue. There are no repeats of combinations. When cards are discarded, discard them facedown. When the draw pile runs out, do not reshuffle the discard pile. When the draw pile is empty, powers that require drawing a card cannot be used.&#10;&#10;Each turn you may take any action on the roles card. Everyone has access to black actions (they are always safe). If players use a green or blue action, their opponents may call their bluff. When an opponent is the target of a spy or assassinate, they may use the sentinel or facade actions to counter them. These 2 blue actions do not require an action to use (though they can still be bluffs).&#10;&#10;When you think an opponent has sentinel, be sure to accuse them  because they will block an assassination attempts.&#10;&#10;Roles:&#10;Accuse (Black) - Guess a player&rsquo;s identity. If you are right they die, otherwise you die.&#10;Invent (Black) - Discard your identity and draw a new one.&#10;Assassinate (Green) - Guess a player&rsquo;s identity, if you are right they die.&#10;Spy (Green) - Look at another player&rsquo;s identity.&#10;Disguise (Green) - Draw a new Identity then discard one.&#10;Sentinel (Blue) - Prevent Assassination.&#10;Facade (Blue) - Prevent Spy.&#10;Scour (Blue) - Look through discard pile or draw pile (shuffle draw pile after).&#10;&#10;In the Mace Exclusive version of Exploit!, all the green keywords are red!&#10;&#10;",

Ember perfectly caters to the little voice in all of us that holds a grudge. With plenty of opportunities for revenge, you won&rsquo;t have to listen to that voice for very long before it&rsquo;s satisfied. Don&rsquo;t be shy and show no mercy, as you will receive none in return!&#10;&#10;Playing as one of four heroes you collect the mysterious ember stones to defeat Ingduhl the Shadow Demon. Only the hero who collects the most ember stones will be able to defeat the Shadow Demon and save the world from his shroud.&#10;&#10;In either a fierce dual between hardened experts or a four-player frenzy, players amass ember stones by strategically using card effects and by collecting the cards in their Emberscapes. Unique to Ambyria is concept of an umbrella effect over your play area called the Mode, which will determine the tactic for your turn. Whether you need to gather more resources, or you need more time to play your cards safely, or if you are ready to claim your ember stones, your mode will be important on your path to victory.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In A Game of Thrones: The Card Game, the warring factions of Westeros await your command, inviting you to engage in a life-or-death struggle. In every game, you select devious plots and challenge your opponents on the field of battle, through back alley intrigue, and in the political arena. Whether you play a against a single opponent, in a game known as a joust, or engage in a battle of three or more players, called a melee, winning challenges against your opponents is the way to victory.&#10;&#10;Your ultimate goal in A Game of Thrones: The Card Game is to gain influence over the greatest seat of power in Westeros: the Iron Throne! To achieve this goal, you must call upon iconic characters, such as Tywin Lannister, Robb Stark, Stannis Baratheon, Daenerys Targaryen, Euron Crow's Eye, The Red Viper, and dozens of others. You must maneuver the members of your House and your allies in a constant battle to gain power. The first player to claim fifteen power wins!&#10;&#10;In the game, each player has two decks: a draw deck and a plot deck. Your draw deck contains the tactical elements of your struggle, including the characters, locations, attachments, and events that you call upon in your struggle to claim the Iron Throne. You can command characters from throughout A Song of Ice and Fire, and you can march forth from the icy walls of Winterfell or muster your armies around Casterly Rock. You may even equip your characters with storied weapons, such as the Valyrian steel blades Ice or Widow's Wail. The draw deck holds these powerful characters, locations, attachments, and events. This deck is randomly shuffled and players draw their hands from this deck.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, each player simultaneously chooses and reveals one of the plot cards from their individual seven-card plot decks. Your plot for a round determines how much gold you can spend on cards, which player starts with initiative, and how powerful your challenges are. Your plot also bears a reserve value, which determines how many cards you can keep in your hand past the end of the round. Plots may also offer powerful effects that can trigger when the plots are revealed or persist to shape the entire game round. You may scorch the earth with a deadly wildfire assault, or call upon all players to support the faith of the Seven.&#10;&#10;A Game of Thrones: The Card Game (Second Edition) differs from the first edition of the game due to elements being cut, elements being revised or updated, and elements being added. Influence was a holdover from the game's origin as a CCG and is now unnecessary, while crests offered nothing to distinguish them from traits and made the game more difficult for new players to learn. Existing keywords have been pruned, and some new keywords have been added to showcase the most interesting and essential interactions.&#10;&#10;The timing rules &mdash; such as the details of moribund, passive effects with triggers, and save/cancel responses &mdash; will be replaced with a more straightforward timing system that takes advantage of the Interrupt, Reaction, and Forced triggers that have been successfully employed in some of FFG's newer LCGs.&#10;&#10;The second edition also includes two new factions beyond the six Houses in the first edition. New deck-building rules empower players with more options in combining factions, alongside a means of building more focused and specialized plot decks.&#10;&#10;",

The last player to place a block without causing the platform to tumble wins.&#10;&#10;Hoverkraft is intended for two players, but it's fun to challenge yourself to build bigger and better structures. And it's a fast game, lasting anywhere from 30 seconds (what? we were distracted) to 5 minutes. Bring it to a party and you can have an entire tournament in a few hours. Your friends may curse you for introducing them to Hoverkraft at first, but they'll be drawn back to it. There's something addictive about it.&#10;&#10;",

The leader's abilities alter vastly the strategy and playability of every other card in the deck, making the game playable in 25 different ways.&#10;&#10;In the game, players take turns placing cards and attacking. Each card can activate in various ways, taking on offensive capabilities in the front rows of the unit, or support powers in the back rows. Cards can also be played as orders &ndash; powerful single-time effects that can turn the tide of battle.&#10;&#10;Play continues until either player's leader is defeated. A typical game is best of three or five rounds.&#10;&#10;Pixel Tactics Deluxe is a perfect place to start playing the game. This large box contains enough cards for two players, rules, punch tokens, and storage space for all the other Pixel Tactics games in print. Whether you're a veteran of the series, or just looking to get your feet wet, it's a great place to start.&#10;&#10;All 25 heroes in Pixel Tactics Deluxe are brand new!&#10;&#10;",
