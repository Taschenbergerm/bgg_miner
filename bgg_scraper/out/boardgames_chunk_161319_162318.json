There are four rivalling factions currently at war, and each player must choose their allegiance, construct a deck and then charge into battle to claim victory for their faction.&#10;&#10;The Core Set features over 190 cards, allowing players to build their own decks using a combination of faction and neutral cards to fully customise their Titan build. Each Titan build must carefully balance its reliance on combat equipment armed and activated during the fight, pilot manoeuvres which are activated as surprise actions to evade or ambush, and field skills which provide support from other battlefield units.&#10;&#10;Players battle it out over a number of rounds until only one Titan is left standing victorious.&#10;&#10;",

They'll have to distribute their forces all over the world, conquer the production places of drugs (for example: Colombia or Afghanistan) and the markets (cities like Los Angeles, Amsterdam or Tokio), organizing the flow of 4 kinds of substances that have different perks. This way players will gain soldiers that can be used to attack or defend; cooperation is acceptable, regulated and sometimes very useful. There are also cards to be drawn at each turn, inspired by historical or fictitious events related to the criminal world. They can have good or bad effects, and often there are choices to be made.&#10;&#10;The goal is known at the beginning of the game, when each player draws a goal card (all different but balanced) that has to remain secret until the conditions of victory are fulfilled. There's also a semi-randomized countdown towards legalization: an event that in our point of view (and according to the ideas of many economists) would terminate the business of Cartels. When this happens (after 2-3 hours, according to the players' choices) the game is over and victory is assigned by points.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Hit It! is a quick print &amp; play card game of tennis for two players.&#10;&#10;Each player has a deck of 25 cards, of three types to represent different tennis shots, plus two types of cards that modify shots. Each player sets out four cards face down to form the playing surface. (Choosing these cards adds an element of deck building to the game.) Each player takes six of the remaining cards from their deck. The first player &quot;serves&quot; by placing a card on one of the opponent's hitting zones and draws a replacement card from his deck. The opponent then moves his player marker to the ball and selects what card he will use to hit the ball back. This continues until one player manages to place a fourth card in a particular hitting zone, or a player is unable to return the ball.&#10;&#10;Play continues until one player has won the set, i.e. six games.&#10;&#10;Hit It! has abstracted tennis into a quick tactical card game, but retains the feel of the sport.&#10;&#10;",

The cards have pictures of die rolls, but the frequency of the numbers does not quite match the statistical likelihood of rolling those numbers on 2D6. For example, there are equal numbers of sixes, sevens, and eights.&#10;&#10;To play, players turn over cards and hope to get certain numbers and avoid others, just as in Craps. Once a card is turned over, it remains face up for the remainder the player's turn, which slightly affects the statistical probability of finding another card with the same number.&#10;&#10;",

When opponents land on players owned property, the owning player collects rent from the landing player. Owning sets of properties increases the rent paid to the player who owns them, by the player who lands on the square. The ultimate goal is to have the most money and drive opponents into bankruptcy.&#10;&#10;The classic Monopoly with constructions and other (fancy) elements of the Great Canadian Gaming Cooperation.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "From the rules:&#10;Investo is a game of High Finance for three or more players. Play consists of investing In various companies, and receiving from the &quot;INVESTO&quot; Bank, Dividends and Bonuses in accordance with Instructions on a number of cards drawn by the players in rotation. Companies become bankrupt by the drawing of one of the Bankrupt cards.&#10;&#10;TO BEGIN. One of the players is selected as Banker, and issues each of the players with &pound;1,000 with which to make his or her investments; retaining the balance of the money as the &quot;INVESTO&quot; Bank. (The Banker is entitled to join in the game, and should also receive the initial &pound;1,000.) The cards are then shuffled and placed face downwards in the centre of the table. The cards representing the ten companies are shuffled separately and placed face downwards beside the Banker, who is at all times in charge of the game. A number of company cards are then turned face upwards, in front of the Banker; the number so faced being one less than the number of players. (e.g. If five people are playing, then four company cards are turned up.) Players now invest in one or more of the companies as desired. All investments must be in multiples of &pound;100. The Banker keeps a record of all investments.&#10; THE PLAY. The first player (determined by any method desired) then draws the top card and places it face up in front of him. Each card has a number of the top representing one of the companies. If the player drawing the card has invested in that company, he announces the dividend (e.g. No. 4 &mdash;30% or 6/- in the &pound;). The Banker thereupon pays ALL players who have invested in No. 4 company, 30% of their investment, from the money in the Bank. Should the player not have invested in the company whose card is drawn, the play passes to the person next on his left, and so on round the table; each player announcing the dividend or bonus to be paid. ONLY If he has money invested in the company.&#10;&#10;BANKRUPTCY. On a player drawing a &quot;BANKRUPT&quot; card for the company in which he has invested, he announces &quot;No. 7 &mdash;Bankrupt&quot;, and then reads the directions as to payment to or from the Bank (e.g. &quot;Shareholders must pay in 10/- for every &pound; invested, to meet the liabilities of the Company.&quot;) or &quot;Shareholders receive 5/- for every &pound; invested in the Company, from the sale of assets,&quot; as the case may be. The Banker then collects the money from, or pays the money to, the shareholders in accordance with the instructions. After all the players have paid or received their money, the Banker removes the bankrupt company from play and exposes the next company card. Any player who had invested in the company that was just bankrupt now has the opportunity to invest in the new company. There is no compulsion, and a player who has money invested in another company may elect not to invest in the new company. On oil investments being completed and recorded by the Banker, play continues with the next player.&#10;&#10;CHANGE OF INVESTMENT. Changes in investments can only be made when all the cards have been drown. All changes must be recorded by the banker who makes a charge of 10% on the total investment for the issue of the new &quot;Script&quot;. (e.g. a player increases his investment as one of the companies from &pound;200 to &pound;500. The Banker charges &pound;50.). &#10;GENERAL. After all the cards have been drawn, they are re-shuffled, placed face down, and commeacing with the player on the left of the person who drew the last card, play re-commences. When a company is bankrupt and there are no more companies to be exposed, the players who had invested in the last company to go bankrupt may choose any ONE of the remaining companies in which to invest. The game is cancluded when the last company is bankrupt. The winner is the player who finishes the game with the most money.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The Let's Go To College game employs a gambling technique, with chips, to allow players to complete courses as a freshman, a sophomore, a junior, and a senior. Prentice employed illustrators to produce bright graphics in his games and utilized high quality materials as well.&#10;&#10;From the rules:&#10;&#10;SETTING UP THE GAME. The playing board with the colored chart is placed in the center of the table. The playing cards are lined up with the four packs of picture cards, face up, on one side of the playing board. They should be in this order: Freshman, Sophomore, Junior and Senior. On the other side of the board the four packs of Fun, Sports, Re-Exam and Flunk cards should be placed with these words up. The chips are divided among the players so that each has an equal amount of l's, 2's, 3's, 5's and 10's.&#10;&#10;PLAYING THE GAME. The player on the left of the host plays first As a Freshman entering I. O. U., he stands up each time he plays. If he fails to remember this, he must draw a Flunk card as a penalty, altnougn he does not miss his turn. He pays 5 chips, registration fee, to the business office. He then rolls the dice on the playing board as he tries to pass his first course. Only the dice which remain on the board alter rolling , may be counted, using only the top numbers. He multiplies the dice total by ten to find his grade for the course. After rolling the dice, the player proceeds all follows: If, after multiplying, his grade comes to 120: he must pay 2 chips to petty expense, on the playing board, placing the chips so they do not interfere with the chart. If his grade is 110, he must pay 1 chip. This means he has tried too hard to pass. In either case he rolls the dice again, right away. If his grade is 100, 90, 80 or 70, he can draw the top Freshman Course card and keep it. He also must take or put chips into petty expense as indicated opposite his grade on the chart. If there are not enough chips to take, he is out of luck, and can take only what is there. This happens quite frequently throughout the game. If his grade is 60, 50 or 40, he must place on playing board the indicated number of &quot;put&quot; chips. He then has his choice of drawing a Fun, Sport or Re-Exam card. He must read his card aloud and after fulfilling the duties, he returns it to the bottom of the same pack. &#10;If his grade is 30, 20 or 10, he must place on playing board the indicated number of &quot;put&quot; chips. He then has to take a Flunk card and follow its instructions before returning it to bottom of pack. If both dice roll off the playing board he receives a zero, and must place 15 chips on the board and draw a Flunk card. As soon as a player has completed his turn, the next player on his left rolls the dice to obtain his grade for his first Freshman course, and so on. To pass Freshman year and become a Sophomore, a player must hold two Freshman Course cards. The first to finish Freshman year receives all chips in Petty Expense. As soon as each player finishes his first year he must pay 5 chips, registration fee for Sophomore year, to the business office. Sophomore year is the same as Freshman year, only players may now be seated while playing. Sophomores must have two Soph Course cards before becoming Juniors. The first to finish receives all chips in petty expense. As soon as players finish Sophomore year they pay 5 chips, registration fee for Junior year, to the business office. Junior year proceeds the same as Sophomore year. The first to finish receives all chips in petty expense. As soon as a player gets two Junior Course cards he must pay 5 chips, registration fee for Senior year, to the business office. Seniors must obtain the usual two Senior Course cards before graduation. The first to finish Senior year receives all chips petty expense and IMMEDIATELY the game is ended.&#10;&#10;",

The game was one of their &quot;Upidee&quot; series which featured cards laid out to form a track for a race game. The set includes 20 cards with numbered and beautifully illustrated slots, five standing figures of &quot;Sailor boys&quot;, bifold instructions, spinning die called a teetotum and box.&#10;&#10;The game is played by first laying out the cards in order to form a track. Each player chooses a sailor boy, paying five counters into the pool. Players spin the teetotum and place their sailor on that number, and continue to move him along the board based on the teetotum numbers thrown. When a player lands on a picture, they must follow certain rules, such as: 1 &ndash; Enter the Royal Navy and join the training ship. Receives one counter from each player. 50 &ndash; is tried by courtmartial on a charge of drunkenness on duty, and sentenced to lose five years seniority. Pays three counters into the pool and goes back to 39.&#10;&#10;The box measures 3 13/16&quot; x 4 3/4&quot; 1 1/4&quot;. The cards (track) measure 3 5/8&quot; x 2 1/8&quot;.

Corps).&#10;&#10;The Battle of the Marne signaled the failure of the Schlieffen Plan and of German hopes to win a quick, decisive victory. In turn, this triggered the Race for the Sea as opposing armies attempted to outflank each other. Then, in a final bid to gain the upper hand, both Allied and German Armies clashed in the First Battle of Ypres. On these fields, the British Expeditionary Force, the professional army of Britain, and the strongest on the Continent, was bled dry.&#10;&#10;Ypres 1914 is a brigade/regiment level simulation of the First Battle of Ypres.

The city was almost totally destroyed. The Marques of Pombal &mdash; Sebasti&atilde;o Jos&eacute; de Carvalho e Melo &mdash; was the then Minister of Foreign Affairs and the King put him in charge of the reconstruction of Lisbon. The Marques of Pombal gathered a team of engineers and architects and you, the players, are members of the nobility; members who will use your influence in the reconstruction and business development of the new city. You will work with the architects to build Lisbon anew, with the Marquis to develop commerce and with the King to open all the buildings, but the true reason you do all this is not for greatness or fame or even fortune, but for the most important thing of all in that time: wigs.&#10;&#10;Lisboa is played on a real map of downtown Lisbon. During the planning of the downtown project, the type of business permitted in each street was previously determined. The economic motor is driven by the wealth of the royal treasure and this treasure is controlled by player actions during the game, making each game a totally different experience. The game ends after a fixed number of rounds and whoever gathers the most wigs by the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Lisboa is played in rounds. Each round, all players play one turn. They may place one card on their display or replace one card from this display. During the game, players schedule hearings to get character favors, such as commerce, construction, and openings. The iconic buildings score the stores and stores provide income to the players. Players need to manage influence, construction licenses, store permits, church power, workers and money, with the workers' cost being dependent on the prestige of the players.&#10;&#10;",

The OP draws 3 Status Cards (which have questions or fill in the blanks) and picks one. Everyone then picks a Comment Card from their hand, and the players take turns reading their cards out. Cards can also have special effects ranging from drawing more cards to having to read it out in a funny accent. Once everyone's read, each player picks up a Like token and hands it to another player. Whenever you stop playing, whoever has the most Likes is the winner!&#10;&#10;",

Using a combination of wooden tiles and artisan dice, players attempt to create words based on their dice roll. Each letter die multiplies the word score. Players must then decide whether to stop and score or draw another die, roll again, and risk it all!&#10;&#10;Each letter and die has a point value similar to Scrabble. The twist is in the multiplication of your score by the number of letter dice used.&#10;&#10;In each round, the player begins by rolling one die. The player uses that die and nine wooden tiles to make a single word. The player can stop there and score, or bank the used tiles to score later, take an additional die, roll both dice, and make a new word with the remaining tiles. This new word will now be scored with a multiplier of 2 (with 2 dice). Players can continue with this adding dice and making words as long as they have tiles left. If a player fails to make a word, they score only their banked tiles with no multipliers.&#10;&#10;",

The Mutineer's goal: to survive while the others attempt to discover you.&#10;&#10;Players take on the role of one of the 8 crew members on the ship: Chaplain, Boatswain, Quartermaster, Surgeon, Navigator, First Mate, Master Gunner, or Cabin Boy. Roles are public knowledge, but the identity of the mutineer remains hidden. Over the course of two rounds, players try to discover the mutineer through discussion, accusation, denial, and special actions. The game ends with a vote to convict one player guilty of mutiny. If the mutineer is voted guilty, all the other players win. Otherwise, the mutineer wins.&#10;&#10;Each role has unique abilities that may help reveal the mutineer or allow them to exert control over the the voting. Since any player could be the mutineer, an accusation could be helpful, or a clever attempt to re-direct suspicion elsewhere. Mutiny is a social game with a minimal rule set.

        "description": "This game allows 2-4 players (2-6 with the Avant Garde expansion) to experience and survive the chaotic times of the French Revolution. This is the first of nine releases planned for a fun deck building that can all be connected to play as one game.&#10;&#10;The Avant Europa series allows you to walk through important times in the history of France and other nations of Europe. Have your own shot at impacting history by making the choices that change it. Witness the events that shaped the national histories of that era, and try to survive them while building your own political Empire.&#10;&#10;The Avant Europa - Liberte storyline represents the viewpoint of various small noble factions. Starting out with a small Commune you build up your connections and influences in Politics, Lands, Trade, Economics, Goods, and Military. The goal is to protect France from it's enemies (inside and out), but also to be the one player with the most Victory Points amassed at the end of the game. As your Empire of influence grows at some point you can end up commanding great influence and power across Revolutionary France.&#10;&#10;Players begin with a standard deck of 8-10 cards - depending on if playing the basic, intermediate, or advanced rules.   The game runs from 12 turns (basic) to 28 turns (full version), divided into turns called &quot;Seasons&quot;. At the beginning of each Season players draw four cards into hand. Play continues in Rounds until all but the last player have used or played all of the cards in their hand. That player gets one last Round of play and the Season ends.&#10;&#10;Each Season player initiative is important because being First Player to start a Season gives that player first go at available cards in the Commons to purchase. Like many deck-building games there is the typical 1-and-1 Round, where a player can play 1 Action and gets 1 additional choice (usually to Purchase cards from the Commons that get added to the owners discard - and thus eventually to the players hand).&#10;&#10;In addition players can move cards to their Domain, which reflects their public face to the world.  Cards in Domain are not discarded until used and can be played as if from hand. Many give special abilities and benefits that increase a players ability to response to other players actions, increase income generated by other cards, have special means of defense, etc.  To add even more color to game play these Domains can come with Asset cards that are unique to the controlling player and provide political flavour of the times to expand the options of game play.&#10;&#10;This game is a very diverse peek into the life and times of the people of the era's it represents. Actual historical personalities and figures of the Revolution are available as Allies, along with the actual historically political factions, organizations, and local government forces of the day.&#10;&#10;Unique mechanics include the ability to Raise Funds that the player can add to their treasury to help purchase cards, make bribes, and pay off Tax collectors -- which were the common bane of public that lead to the Revolution.  Other unique mechanics include the ability to place Bribes on cards in Commons area, the ability to Power Block some cards to prevent others from using or getting them. Players can engage in gathering Goods that can be sold on the open market for increased income. Players have the option of building up basic militia forces to protect themselves against common Bandits or foreign powers, or to use their military to defend against other players once the anger of the French Revolution and civil conflict goes into full swing.&#10;&#10;Every card in the game has two or more uses, which is what makes provides the plethora of strategic choices and card combinations. The game promises no two play sessions of this game will be exactly the same, and it is easy to see why given the options. The game will certainly appeal to veteran card fans of games like L5R or Magic who appreciate the artistic details. It will also appeal to players who have played out their copies of Dominion and want something far more immensely real then Ascension or Thunderstone.&#10;&#10;There are many roads to Victory, largely based on the acquisition of certain key cards of value -- especially getting control of Cities and Ports of France. This can be done many ways,  through political underhanded activities, military force, or economic control. The person with the most Victory Points accumulated at games end determines the winner. However there are other ways to win the game outright, such as by getting three Historical Events into a players Domain.&#10;&#10;The strategic depth of this unique deck-builder game surpasses anything you have played before.  With over 16 core strategies that you can pursue in combination to arrive at final victory, you will find yourself playing multiple times to figure out your own preferred winning combo.&#10;&#10;This release Avant Europa - Liberte covers the period of the early French Revolution (1789 - 1793). More expansions are planned to follow, including three covering the rise of Napoleon, and three that cover the early years of French settlement in North America. The truly historical fans will be able to play all the released expansions modules in sequence from start to finish if they wish. You will be able to relive French History from 1600 to 1815.&#10;&#10;Available expansions for this game include Avant Europa - Nationale (Age of Sail)which includes the years of trade and exploration before the Revolution (1760-1788). There is also the Avant Garde expansion which is both a two player introduction to the AE Universe, but that also served as the 5 and 6 player expansion for the base &quot;AE-Liberte&quot; release.&#10;&#10;Other releases for &quot;Avant Britannia&quot; and &quot;Avant Hispania&quot; are also planned.&#10;&#10;",

The tanks have values for movement, attack modifier, size modifer, movement points, and front/side/rear armor. Characters give have special limited-use abilities and modifiers for the tanks they're with.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with 5 cards, and draws 1 each turn. They use the cards to determine what actions they use each turn, such as movement (sometimes one tank, sometimes many), fire, a combination of both (with different modifiers), or other abilties. Other cards may be used as reactions to a card played by the other player, and some are special effects that happen upon drawing the card.&#10;&#10;Game system is based on World Tank Battles.&#10;A sequel Panzer Vor Ausf. 2 was published in 2016.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Stockpile is an economic board game that combines the traditional stockholding strategy of buy low, sell high with several additional mechanisms to create a fast-paced, engaging and interactive experience.&#10;&#10;In Stockpile, players act as stock market investors at the end of the 20th century hoping to strike it rich, and the investor with the most money at the end of the game is the winner. Stockpile centers on the idea that nobody knows everything about the stock market, but everyone does know something. In the game, this philosophy manifests in two ways: insider information and the stockpile.&#10;&#10;First, players are given insider information each round. This information dictates how a stock&rsquo;s value will change at the end of the round. By privately learning if a stock is going to move up or down, each player has a chance to act ahead of the market by buying or selling at the right time.&#10;&#10;Second, players purchase their stocks by bidding on piles of cards called stockpiles. These stockpiles will contain a mixture of face-up and face-down cards placed by other players in the game. In this way, nobody will know all of the cards in the stockpiles. Not all cards are good either. Trading fees can poison the piles by making players pay more than they bid. By putting stocks and other cards up for auction, Stockpile catalyzes player interaction, especially when potential profits from insider information are on the line.&#10;&#10;Both of these mechanisms are combined with some stock market elements to make players consider multiple factors when selling a stock. Do you hold onto a stock in hopes of catching a lucrative stock split or do you sell now to avoid the potential company bankruptcy? Can you hold onto your stock until the end of the game to become the majority shareholder, or do you need the liquidity of cash now for future bidding? Do you risk it all by investing heavily into one company, or do you mitigate your risk by diversifying your portfolio?&#10;&#10;In the end, everyone knows something about the stock market, so it all comes down to strategy execution. Will you be able to navigate the movements of the stock market with certainty? Or will your investments go under from poor predictions?&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Dungeon Lords: Happy Anniversary includes the Dungeon Lords base game, the Festival Season expansion, stickers for food tokens, metal coins, a new &quot;Dungeon Set-up&quot; mini-expansion, and other items.&#10;&#10;In Dungeon Lords, you are an evil dungeon lord who is trying to build the best dungeon out there. You hire monsters, build rooms, buy traps and defeat the do-gooders who wish to bring you down. Each turn, players use a hand of cards to choose where to place their worker imps. Actions vary from mining gold, hiring monsters, buying traps etc. Each action has three spots available - with each spot having different effects (e.g., mining gold lets you mine more gold in each spot). When using the cards, two cards will become locked and will not be able to be used next turn.&#10;&#10;The entire game lasts two &quot;game years&quot;, and each year consists of four seasons (a.k.a. turns). At the start of each season, players see the heroes and events to come in the following season, allowing them to prepare. At the end of each season after the first, heroes are allocated to each player according to the players' level of evilness. Heroes range from mighty heroes to sneaky thieves. Each hero has its own power for which the player needs to prepare for. At the end of each year, the heroes travel into the dungeons to fight.&#10;&#10;Scoring in the game is based upon what you have built, the monsters you have hired and the heroes you have captured.&#10;&#10;The Festival Season expansion adds a fifth season to the year:  festival season. More time to build your dungeon, but also more time for adventurers to gather a larger party. There are new monsters, rooms, and traps to prepare your dungeon for the battle, but also new nasty spells for the adventurers and sneaky bards who encourage them to perform so-called &quot;heroic&quot; deeds &ndash; not to mention two paladins for each year, now ready to punish up to two evil players.&#10;&#10;Would you like to push other players toward evil instead of moving yourself toward good when visiting the city? What about making an investment instead of traditional gold digging? Or what about repairing conquered tunnels or rooms instead of digging new ones? Only eight actions are still available to you, but each season one of those actions is replaced by an alternate set of spaces that offer new and intriguing options. And did we mention that it has recently become fashionable for dungeon lords to have their own personal pets?&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Omert&agrave;, el poder de la mafia is a highly strategic card game, in which each player leads one of the five mafia families from NYC. Set in the 30s-40s, the families have to fight for the control of their businesses (arms trade, prostitution, illegal gambling...), spread around NYC's five neighborhoods (Queens, Manhattan, Bronx, Staten Island and Brooklyn). Each family has a main goal to achieve during the game, and several secondary objectives that can make the family improve.&#10;&#10;By means of money and respect points, each family can increase its members (gangsters, soldiers), who will help control the domains and businesses their family owns.&#10;&#10;Strategic balance between defense of one's possessions and the conquest of new domains will be key to the game, but chance will also take part in it, as attacks, defense movements and several other actions required by many event cards will make us throw the dice.&#10;&#10;The final goal of the game is to fulfill the requirements set in a main goal card given out at the beginning of the game, and achieving in addition as many secondary objectives as possible, which will bring us additional respect points.&#10;&#10;Original Spanish description:&#10;Omert&agrave;, el poder de la mafia, es un juego de cartas altamente estrat&eacute;gico, en el que cada jugador gu&iacute;a los designios de una de las cinco familias mafiosas de Nueva York.

Cada Familia tendr&aacute; un objetivo principal a cumplir durante su partida, y varios secundarios que le dar&aacute;n la posibilidad de mejorar su familia.&#10;&#10;Por medio del dinero y los Puntos de Respeto podremos ir haciendo crecer nuestra familia (capos, soldados), que a su vez controlar&aacute;n los dominios y negocios que su familia tenga en su poder.&#10;&#10;El equilibrio estrat&eacute;gico entre la defensa de nuestras posesiones y la conquista y asalto de nuevos dominios ser&aacute; la clave del juego, que no se ve libre de un cierto efecto &quot;suerte&quot;, ya que los ataques, defensas y ciertas acciones requeridas por las variad&iacute;simas cartas de Evento nos llevar&aacute;n a realizar tiradas de dados.&#10;&#10;El objetivo final del juego es cumplir los requisitos establecidos por una carta de objetivo principal que se nos entregar&aacute; al comienzo de la partida, pudiendo cumplir adem&aacute;s tantos objetivos secundarios como seamos capaces y que nos aportar&aacute;n Puntos de Respeto adicionales.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;",

Each soldier belongs to a specific class with unique abilities like heavy gunner, rifle man, mechanic, driver, medic and gun operator. Each unit consists of 2-4 soldiers (each unit is built around a commanding officer). Every soldier can gain a level up, making him more efficient in battle, or giving more abilities.&#10;&#10;During players turn player issues a basic order to his troops like &quot;advance&quot;,&quot;fall back&quot;,&quot;move to left/right flank&quot;,attack a unit. While orders can be precised to specific units and target. Way they're handled is up to units and their officers in command. During action units that suffered a casualty might flee, decide to fortify, or even advance in counterattack. Goal of the game is to gain control over battlefield by either eliminating enemy units or gaining points of interest. However, the player is operating in a small section of battlefield and has to take into account that not only units visible on the map are a threat.&#10;&#10;Original game design was for 2 players. But solo campaign and cooperative play are also in works. Also game is prepared to take into account game masters possibilities using special set of story and event cards.&#10;&#10;",

This is an epic story of early Irish Literature. It tells of a war against Ulster by the Connacht queen Medb and her husband Ailill, who intend to steal the bull Donn Cuailnge, opposed only by the Ulster hero Cuchulain.&#10;&#10;Can Cuchulain hold off an entire army single-handedly or will Medb&rsquo;s warriors win the day?&#10;&#10;The Object of the Game&#10;Cuchulain must slay three of Queen Meb&rsquo;s chosen champions to win. If he dies before he does this Queen Medb wins.&#10;&#10;Turn Order&#10;Cuchulain begins with 6 Battle Cards in hand, Queen Medb with 5 Battle Cards. The game is played in alternating turns, beginning with Queen Medb. A turn consists of two phases: Support and Combat.&#10;&#10;On a player&rsquo;s turn they will first Support&#10;&#10;1. Draw back to 5 or 6 Battle Cards in hand depending upon the player. Shuffle the discard deck if necessary to create a new Draw Deck. If a player has more than their starting number of cards in hand, they do not draw new ones. Players always draw cards to replenish their hand at the start of their turn.&#10;&#10;2. The player may then choose to:&#10;&#10;Play one Battle Card from hand as an Event, either discarding the card or removing (in this case the card will state it is to be removed)&#10;or&#10;Discard one or more Battle Cards from hand for action points, marking the Action Points (AP) on the respective track.&#10;or&#10;Play one Battle Card from hand as an Attack or Defense Stat Boost. The card is placed horizontally to the right of Cuchulain or Medb&rsquo;s Champion, aligning with their base Attack and Defense values. In subsequent turns, additional cards may also boost these stats. Overlap each card so that the values can be read horizontally.&#10;or&#10;Play one Battle Card from hand to Heal, discarding the card. This option may only be chosen by Cuchulain&#10;&#10;3. Then, if the player chooses to, they may Combat as the Attacker&#10;&#10;4. When the Combat phase has ended, discard all cards played the Combat Lines to their respective discard decks.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In 1936, the Universal Games Company of St. Louis, Mo. published the Mor-Fun Stock Exchange game. It was a bit out of the ordinary as the game board was made of 1/4&quot; thick pressed board stock and had a long heavy metal spinner that spun on bearings. The lowest cost 'Home Model' sold for $5, which was a lot for a game in the 1930s. By comparison, the very popular game of Monopoly retailed for $2.00.&#10;&#10;There was no scrip or play money with the game, the only trading was done with stock shares. The players trade stocks; the amount traded and the profit is determined by spinning the metal spinner then throwing the dice.&#10;&#10;Each player is assigned a player number and in turn is a 'buyer' and spins the indicator bar.  The player whose number the indicator lands on is the 'seller'.  The number of stock shares will be shown under the players number where the indicator stops.  The 'seller' then rolls the dice to determine the amount of profit the 'buyer' must pay for the stock shares. Multiply the number thrown on the dice by the number of shares to be transacted equals the amount of shares the 'buyer' must pay the 'seller'.&#10;&#10;In addition, there are 'Futures', Margins', and the 'Pit' where players may be required to put shares of stock that can subsequently be won by any player as described in the rules.&#10;&#10;The player who acquires the most stock at the end of the game wins.  A player who runs out of stocks is eliminated from the game and play continues to an agreed upon time.&#10;&#10;There is no scrip or game money, all transactions are completed with shares of stock.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "D24 Wrestling can be played with one to four players. It combines the elements of dice rolling (with a D24 die!) action, strategy, role play and simulation into one awesome package, with matches taking place in real-time!&#10;&#10;D24 Wrestling features faces (good guys), heels (bad guys), combining for a total of 20 unique playing cards. Each card has a full color illustration on the front, and game play stats on the back. We have main event stars (like Superbandit, Goliath, all the way down to low carders like Tadpole). The unpredictability of the D24 die adds to the &quot;anything can happen&quot; feel of the game!&#10;&#10;There are two versions of the game: basic and advanced. A &quot;basic&quot; match begins when two players roll the d24 to see which wrestler will start on offense. The player that gained control will then roll on his wrestler's offensive set (each wrestler has 24 moves, including their finisher(s)! For the offensive wrestler to stay in control, he must roll successfully vs. the skill rating (power, speed, technical, brawling, aerial and striking). The offensive wrestler loses control when he does not roll successfully vs. his skill rating; then the opponent takes over on offense (just like a real match!). When a wrestler hits their finisher, the opponent must roll their 3-Count or Submission Rating, plus the opponent's finisher rating, to see if he is defeated. If the opponent rolls their 3-Count Rating or below, the match is over and the opponent wins (there are also other random ways to win, such as pin scenarios on the &quot;Into the Ropes Action Chart&quot;).&#10;&#10;The advanced game turns up the heat with more strategy options and player input. The advanced game allows a wrestler to attempt pins up to three times during the course of a match. Strength of moves is taken into account (some moves are more damaging than others). Maximum Damage Points from close pins/submission attempts, and finishers indicate how hurt a wrestler is, including blood! The advanced game also allows for wrestlers to use steel chairs and other foreign objects...but be careful, a disqualification may result! Other options found in the advanced version: exiting the ring, suicida moves, finisher counters, submission wrestling--you have four turns to get out of a basic submission move, and three for a submission finisher--or you tap out!&#10;&#10;The game comes complete with a storyline that also allows you to take on the role of owner/booker/promoter and run your own version of WOX! Crown champions, develop feuds, determine rankings, create TV and house shows that culminate in pay per views! Schedule tournament and play nights or focus on the storyline element of the game...you're in charge!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Lift Off! Get Me Off This Planet! is a fast-paced, &quot;gateway&quot; game where you use the moon and spacecraft to get your Aliens off the planet before it explodes!&#10;&#10;The game has a casual space theme and never takes itself too seriously. Lift Off! Get Me Off This Planet! is easy to learn, fast-paced game, where everyone feels engaged and &quot;in it&quot; until someone has won or the planet explodes!&#10;&#10;The objective of Lift Off! Get Me Off This Planet! is to be the first player to get their Aliens off the planet using resource cards, action cards, and phases of the moon to escape. If the planet explodes before everyone escapes, the player with the most saved Aliens wins.&#10;&#10;What&rsquo;s special about Lift Off! Get me off this Planet is that lift off points (space vehicles) are all different and often require multiple players to work together to take off. For example, a rocket ship takes a lot of resources and can carry 6 aliens from various players. This creates a great dynamic where initially all players are working together to get, say, the first half of their aliens off the planet, but once it starts thinning people become more competitive and tricky about things using action cards to manipulate the moon, change the board, create tornadoes, etc.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Three hundred years ago, the wandering tribe of Scragen settled at the shores of the Pentibar Sea. Over the decades, the settlement grew to be a great city and from it was born the thriving Empire of Vistos.&#10;&#10;Today, Vistos faces a unique challenge. Astemaed, 12th Emperor of the greatest empire the world has ever seen, has died without an heir. By law, it falls on the senate to elect his successor. Very few candidates are worthy in the eyes of the senate. You are among them. Through strength, cunning and the power of your wealth, you must persuade the senate to your side and thwart your rivals' attempts to do the same.&#10;&#10;No higher seat of power exists, no greater title than Emperor of Vistos. Who's coin shall ring the loudest? Who's might shall overcome? Who's knowledge shall prove greatest? The world watches and waits as you attempt... To Be Emperor.&#10;&#10;To Be Emperor is a strategy card game of bidding and resource management. By winning bids on Assets, you gain the resources necessary to maintain Senators you have won to your side as well as to affect game play. By winning bids on Senators, you bring yourself closer to victory. The first player to have persuaded Senators to their side worth 10 or more Influence in the senate is the next Emperor of Vistos. Take care, though. Bid too greedily on senators or use up your resources with haste and you may find the Senators in your pocket seeking deeper pockets elsewhere.&#10;&#10;In the files section are PDF and zip files with the rules and all the cards ready for print and play. You will only need to provide tokens (five per player, a different color for each player). All I ask is that you contact me with any constructive criticism and ideas, how many games you played, how many players and how long for each game.&#10;&#10;",

Now you decide how long you will play and turn around the board. Then everybody tries to make words with letters, that are connected with lines. When you find a word (at least four letters long), you shout it and collect the points. You get one point for every letter in the word you found. You get special points, if you can use the letter in the middle or letters in the third (red) circle. When time runs out, the player with most points is the winner.

For example, Party Orcs can be defeated with either weapons or a barrel of brandy, while the Monster That Can Only Be Defeated By Flaming Arrows can only be defeated by... uh... flaming arrows.&#10;&#10;Each player has a hand of 7 cards, drawn from the deck. There are three categories of cards, Items, Encounters and Effects.&#10;&#10;You can only have 10 weight worth of weapon, tool, treasure and container cards in front of you, but you'll need a variety of item cards to defeat monster, quest and puzzle cards that are played in a 3x3 grid in the center of the table. Encounter cards are worth points, and the person with the most points after one of the four quests has been completed wins.&#10;&#10;Throw in some fiendish traps and game-altering effects, and you have a table full of mayhem as players juggle weapons, treasure and sacks full of kittens as they navigate an increasingly absurd dungeon.&#10;&#10;",

Strange signs have started to appear all over the world: seas flecked with blood, flocks of shadowy figures wheeling in the sky, prophetic visions that leave people mumbling in addled madness. The time has finally come. The Old Ones are stirring, and it&rsquo;s your job to wake them up!&#10;&#10;In Rise of Cthulhu you play as the leader of a cultist faction wishing to awaken Cthulhu and the other Old Ones awaken to rule this world. But a competing faction races against you to be the first to awaken these chaotic masters. By playing various numbered and colored Cultist Cards, you must control the prime Lovecraftian locations &ndash; Arkham, Dunwich, Innsmouth and Kingsport &ndash; in an effort to awaken an Old One. The faction that maintains the most influence on a location will gain favor when the Old One arises, while the losing faction risks the destruction of their sanity and souls. Through clever pairing of colored and numbered cards, players can summon dangerous Monster Cards to their aid, unlock the eldritch secrets of lost Artifact Cards, and even manipulate an Unspeakable Guardian to terrorize your opponent. All of this and more await the cunning and adventurous in this tactical card game of influence and horror for 2 players.&#10;&#10;On your turn you will have 2 actions: you can either draw 2 cards, play 2 cards from your hand, or draw a card and play a card. Cards can be drawn from a face down deck of Cultist cards or a face up pile of discarded Cultists cards, known as the Valley. Cards must be played on your side of one of the four main Lovecraftian locations - Arkham, Dunwich, Innsmouth and Kingsport. The player with the most total points on a given location turns the location to face them, marking that location as being influenced by their cultists. As the values change during gameplay, locations will shift their influence from player to player. Playing three of the same color, three of the same number, or a run of three cards of the same color (ex. 2-3-4 of green) will earn players the right to draw from special Monster and Artifact cards to help their hold on locations or hinder their opponent. At key points in the game, Old Ones will be drawn from the Cultist Deck and attach themselves to a location: the player currently influencing that location will reap the benefits of the Old One. When all three Old Ones awaken, the game ends and the person with the most locations facing them (or points in play if there's a tie) is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

        "name": "Sword & Spear: Wargames Rules for Ancient and Medieval Battles",
        "description": "Sword &amp; Spear is a set of wargames rules for Ancients and Medieval battles. They are suitable for any scale figures and any basing standard, the only requirement being that figures are organized into units of equal frontage. A typical game has around 8&mdash;15 units on each side, and games take around two to three hours. The rules are designed from a top-down perspective, focusing on outcomes rather than detail.&#10; Sword &amp; Spear features a clever and innovative system for activating units that creates interesting and challenging decisions, keeps both players involved at all times, and has a lot of depth and subtlety. Each turn is split into phases, where players each receive a number of action dice, which are rolled and then used to activate their units. The number shown on each dice determines which units can activate (with better quality units being easier to activate), what the unit can do when activated, and also determine the activation sequence. Certain dice also give bonuses to combat, movement distance, or shooting range. So there is a lot to think about, and allocating the action dice well is the key to success (although rolling lots of sixes helps as well!).&#10; The rules are relatively straightforward, and there are no &quot;to hit&quot; tables, charts, or lists of dieroll modifiers. They can be played using only the one-sided Quick Reference Sheet, with very little reference to the rulebook after the first couple of games.&#10; Army lists are available as free downloads online, covering a wide range of Ancient and Medieval armies. These include points for each unit, so that players can play relatively balanced games by building armies to a set points total. There are currently over 40 army lists, including many of the most popular armies, and more are being added each week, with the aim to have over 100 lists available. The rules also include guidelines to help in recreating historic battles, and there are three generic scenarios included as alternatives to the pitched battle.&#10; The strengths of the game are that it gives an exciting, interesting and challenging experience, plays relatively quickly for the size of battle that is being depicted, and the rules are straightforward to learn, whilst having the depth to retain interest after repeated play.&#10;&#10;",

Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of his meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.&#10;&#10;During a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: &quot;Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?&quot; or &quot;Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, giving him a hard time to complete his project and score points?&quot; Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.&#10;&#10;This 2003 special edition comes in a metal box and contains the Carcassonne base game and the 2nd expansion Carcassonne: Expansion 2 &#226;&#128;&#147; Traders & Builders.&#10;&#10;",

Every turn you rummage through the great rubbish heap, bringing home prize mushrooms (or perhaps nasty pests).&#10;&#10;Each turn, you are offered 4 mushrooms pieces, picked blindly from the central heap by the previous player. You must choose three to keep and one to discard. Each type of mushroom/pest has a tastiness value, and a placement rule. You are trying to grow the tastiest mushroom garden.&#10;After a player fills the central hexagon of their garden, the game enters the final round, ending when it returns to that player.&#10;&#10;The pieces are deliberately textured, and the rules suggest that on the 2nd or 3rd game players should be blindfolded, relying on their fingertips to 'see'.&#10;&#10;",

If they were fortunate enough to have overlapped (and thus devoured) tiles of their opponent on the previous turn, their amobea's increased vitality is expressed by the placement (or movement) of extra tiles in this turn.&#10;&#10;The game is simplicity itself, but brings to mind the mental challenge faced by two wrestlers of that delicate Oriental sport, Sumo.&#10;&#10;",

They arrived and discovered an ancient alien warp gate floating amongst the chunks of ice that made up the planets' rings. The leaders of Earth activated the gate and sent expeditions to find out what was on the other side. The explorers returned and told tales of new worlds to discover, colonise and exploit.&#10;&#10;It is now 2265 A.D and with the aid of the warp gate, humanity has spread out across the galaxy. &#10;You are the sole heir to the wealthy Star House of Tamlore. Your palace resides on a frozen world at the edge of the backwater kingdom of Galsia. You have lived a sheltered life knowing little of the wealth your father created by harvesting the Xerer&rsquo;s asteroid fields that dominate the planets skyline, and trading the goods the colonies that you govern have created. In an instant, you are thrust into a Universe full of danger and intrigue where you and your loyal protector Fenrix, barely escape with your lives following a devastating attack on your home world by the insidious Star House Greaver.&#10;&#10;Now completely alone, you must set out to rebuild what you have lost, and seek your revenge&#10;&#10;By using innovative board game mechanics The Space Merchant of Tamlore is the next evolution of adventure gaming!&#10;&#10;",

Being long overdue for returning to her, she has become worried. It is uncovered that he planned on exploring the mysterious house of George Walter Michaels, an abandoned property surrounded by superstition and dark rumors, but when she expressed her worry about such an action, he lied that he would join you instead. At the brink of tears, she requests your assistance in locating him before something tragic can occur. You inform her that any ominous premonitions about her fianc&eacute;&rsquo;s exploration of the house are unfounded, but agree to aid the lady none the less.&#10;&#10;Upon entering the dilapidated building, you all are affronted by unimaginable horrors that threaten life and sanity. Can you find the right door out, the key to open it, and the means to survive until the break of day to be free from those what lurks in the house of George Walter Michaels?&#10;&#10;As a 10 Die Survival Game, the players run through as a group, trying to survive the cards that remove their pile of Dice. If you are out of Dice, you are dead.&#10;&#10;This is a game for 1 or more players. You need 10 six-sided dice per player to play, or if 10 dice per player is too much, you will need some way to track the dice that they have remaining &ndash; a pad of paper, some counters, etc. &ndash; and 10 dice.&#10;&#10;The game also requires a deck of 10 Die Survival cards. This deck should normally be comprised of 3 Salvation cards, and at least half of the total deck should have Encounters (see below). A standard size for a deck is 30 cards.&#10;&#10;Each player should begin the game with 10 six-sided dice; this represents their life/sanity/etc &ndash; when you have 0 dice remaining, you are out of the game.&#10;&#10;When all 3 Salvation cards are found, then the game ends. All players that still have dice remaining can pat themselves on the back, while all dead players shouldn't feel too bad for dying to the difficult circumstances that they were thrust into.&#10;&#10;",

Each player starts the game with three headdresses. Six of eight village tiles are placed in a row, with three of the tiles tilted 90&ordm; to show that they're out of play; each tile has a unique scoring rule on it, and that rule will apply for all of a player's totem poles if he acquires that tile.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player first draws one totem pole from the bag; the game includes 21 totem pole pieces: one eagle, two chiefs, three tomahawks, four animal skins, five teepees and six suns. The player then either places one of his totem pole pieces on an available village tile OR places one of his headdresses on an existing totem pole to claim it; in the latter case, he places this tile in front of himself and tilts the next village tile in line (if any) to make it available for play.&#10;&#10;Once all six poles have been claimed, the players tally their score based on the rules on their tiles, e.g. score 3 points per animal skin on all of your poles or score 2 points per piece for your tallest pole. High score wins.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Railroads was designed to be a game about table talk.  It's about making deals with other players, riding the rise and fall of various authentic nineteenth century railroad companies.  In most railroad board games, one player is one company, and is engaged in pure competition with the other players.  That doesn't make for a very social experience.  Since players are investors in Railroads, they have the opportunity to benefit from semi-cooperative ventures, while hedging out their allies with other investments.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Railroads is not a game about budgets and check books.  Money functions as points and are never spent.  Stock tokens are played and moved in a simplified fashion that means strategy is emphasized and budgeting is eliminated.  Stocks are merely methods of earning money (scoring points) so players can focus on their larger plans.&#10;&#10;Players who play alone in Railroads will not do very well.  Railroads only gain as much track per turn as there are players in the company.  If there is only one player in the company, they only lay one track per turn and will not make a lot of money.  However, if you can get one or two people to join your venture, you can double or triple the speed that your railroads grow, turning your fledgling railroad into a geopolitical force to be reckoned with. Just make sure that when the money dries up, you are the first one out.&#10;&#10;A small number of handmade wooden versions were sold and are available on the second hand market.&#10;&#10;",

Meanwhile they have to try to maintain resources on the island to stay alive such as food, water and shelter.  Players battle it out till one person sails off or everyone else is dead.  Can you survive?&#10;&#10;Island Survival pits you against your opponents.  As you find food, water and shelter you also collect items left from previous castaways that help you survive.  In your search for items to survive you will come across pieces of a raft.  There are eight pieces in all and as each piece is uncovered everyone must assess their health and pay the price for their missing essentials (food, water and shelter). Once all 8 raft pieces are found, the first person to take possession of both oars is able to sail off the island and win the game. Of course, you can always take your hand made weapons and hunt the other players. Last man standing always gets off the island.&#10;&#10;This is a turn-based card game with combat decided by dice rolls and strategic card playing.  As you role play one of six unique characters, you will find new ways to survive the island.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Originally released by Fata Morgana in the 1980s, KREMLIN is a European-style boardgame where players compete to control the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.&#10;&#10;The Jolly Roger KREMLIN features updated art and better components created in the style of 1930s Soviet poster propaganda. This edition has an error on the board that has the name of the game covering part of the graphics and text on the board.&#10;&#10;Kremlin is played for up to ten turns, ending as soon as the Party Chief successfully waves three times at the May Day Parade or when so many politicians are dead or in Siberia that the Party Chief can disband the Politburo and take complete power for himself.&#10;&#10;Each turn has phases.  The most important of these are the KGB trials (which can send party members to Siberia or the cemetery) and the Defense Ministry's Spy Investigations which can also force politicians on a winter's gulag holiday.  With the KGB, the catch is that the higher up the ladder the target, the more difficult to bring down, and Party Chiefs tend to change KGB leaders who take shots at the top...  For the Defense Minister, his investigations require a trial to be successful--and a guilty vote, and that isn't always possible in the Central Committee.&#10;&#10;The catch?  Players allot influence secretly at the start of the game and don't reveal it until it is used, meaning no one knows who controls the KGB or any other ministry, not until Influence is revealed--and even then, who knows who still has undeclared influence on that person?  It is possible that players can swap control back and forth over the KGB chief even as he is trying to determine who to assassinate!&#10;&#10;Once the carnage is done, players have to survive the ravages of aging--and every time a politician takes action, he ages faster than normal...your 50 yr old star of the party?  Well, suddenly he's acting like he's 83, Comrade.  Life near the top will do that to you.  In the Health phase, politicians may die or grow sick--sick politicians can choose to go to the hospital, but while there, they exert no influence and their responsibilities pass on to other politicians. Sometimes this means your man must make the heroic sacrifice to the Rodina and remain on the job even while at death's door.&#10;&#10;Once we know who is still alive, the Party Chief is allowed to move politicians between posts.  After all, he's in control of the bureaucracy.  He can move people up and down, and when he's done, upper ministers do so as well--but can only affect politicians below them on the food chain.  Heck, politicians can even sponsor comrades in exile in Siberia to come back to the People.  Of course, each person you bring back ages you five years....want to bring back five?  Age 25 years in the blink of an eye, Tovarich.&#10;&#10;Intrigue cards allow you to take control of situations or foil other players' schemes.  In one of the older versions, you could have things like Chernobyl take place in 1920.  That's been corrected--so that while events may be the same, they have now been made era-appropriate.&#10;&#10;The turn ends with the May Day Parade.  If the party chief is healthy, he can wave throughout the day making people happy--clearly our socialist union is prospering.  But if he's sick, sometimes he leaves early and is unable to wave, sending doubts through the ranks.  If a faction (player) earns three waves, they win the game.&#10;&#10;The Jolly Roger version provides three different KREMLIN games in one box.&#10;&#10;&#10;     The 'original' with fictional politicians, set in a USSR where KGB investigations send those found guilty to Siberia.  This version will have victory conditions based on the original Fata Morgana rules.&#10;     A version inspired by the Avalon Hill variant titled 'Revolution'.  Set in the 1920s, it uses historical politicians as well as fictional politicians.  It's a more violent game as those arrested by the KGB are shot and removed from the game.&#10;     A new version, set in the modern USSR and Russia, an era of entrenched bureaucracy and alternatives for escaping KGB persecution.  This version introduces the concept of &quot;Going into Exile&quot; to avoid Siberia.  It also includes modern politicians from the 1960s onwards, whether it is Kosygin or Putin and Gorbachev.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The lawsuit brought forth by Harley Davidson in 1997 stopped all sale and production of the game (even though so few had been produced already, as they were only for sale at &quot;The Hog Farm&quot;) an appeal by the owner of the hog farm, Ronald GROTTANELLI, was partially overturned. it was found that The Hog Farm can use the term HOG, but cannot use it in conjunction with items such as this game, effectively ending this board games life span.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to collect nine t-shirt pieces. At the start of each his turn, the player has to answer a question read from a question card. If he answers correctly, he gets to roll a die and move his pawn the indicated number of spaces forward. If he lands on a t-shirt space corresponding to a t-shirt piece that he does not yet have, he gains that piece.&#10;&#10;In addition to the t-shirt spaces, there are penalty spaces which will have some drawback. Among the question cards, there are bonus questions. When a player correctly answers a bonus question, he automatically advances to the next t-shirt space corresponding to a piece he does not yet have.&#10;&#10;When a player has all nine pieces and passes the start/finish space, he wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In January of 1848, an event occurred which changed the face of the west&mdash;gold was discovered on the American River in California. News spread around the world and the era of the 49&rsquo;ers began. Thousands of young people left their farms and homes to make their fortunes out west.&#10;&#10;As these pioneers swarmed to California, hundreds of mining camps sprang up throughout the Mother Lode. Eight miles from the gold discovery site, a camp known as &ldquo;Old Dry Diggins&rdquo; was established. By 1849, it became known as &ldquo;Hangtown.&rdquo;  There are many stories as to how this infamous nickname came to be, but the most common is that in January of 1849, after a very brief trial, three men were hung from a large oak tree near the corner of Main and Center Streets&mdash;an act of swift justice, as they say.&#10;&#10;In April and again in July of 1856, most of Old Hangtown, now bearing the name Placerville, was destroyed by fire. Buildings were ultimately built of brick and stone thereafter. In addition, a large bell tower was erected in the center of town as a fire warning system. By then, people had begun to value the area for more than just mining. The region had an abundance of lumber and rich agricultural land, making it perfectly situated to grow into a thriving community.&#10;&#10;_____________&#10;&#10;In the game of Hangtown, players become Gold Rush era Pioneers who are competing for riches, resources, property, and prestige. &hellip;They must also be prepared to deal with outlaws, shootouts, and hangings at the infamous Hangman&rsquo;s Tree!&#10;&#10;The game features a thoughtful variety of streamlined mechanics, which are notably innovative, yet traditional and familiar in feel&mdash;such as fresh spins on tableau building, worker placement, simultaneous action selection, variable turn order, and resource and hand management.&#10;&#10;Some of the best strategies in Hangtown rely on a balance between optimizing one&rsquo;s own scheme and cunningly &ldquo;playing the players&rdquo;. A standout theme in the game is &ldquo;Boom or Bust&rdquo;. If a player can get &ldquo;out of phase&rdquo; for a turn, he or she will profit from a &ldquo;Boom yield&rdquo; and get bonuses, while the other players may go &ldquo;Bust&rdquo; and get very little. But of course, this takes sharp wits and some clever guesswork&hellip;&#10;&#10;The game is played in a series of rounds, which break down into a series of turns and phases. In a turn, each player selects one card that will determine the phase that his or her Pioneer will take action in. When the players are ready, they simultaneously reveal their chosen cards and place their Pioneer pawns in the corresponding yield sites on the board.&#10;&#10;Then the phases are resolved in numeric order as the players take their Pioneers&rsquo; actions. The total number of Pioneers in each yield site determines whether the outcome is Boom or Bust. To whatever degree, the different site actions allow the players to place workers, activate workers, collect resources, and add cards to their face-up tableau areas of historic buildings, districts, and monuments. Every card built in a tableau grants the player new abilities as well as Victory Points for the final scoring.&#10;&#10;After each turn is completed, the looming Outlaw pawn advances into the next section of the board, locking that particular yield site into a Bust outcome. Furthermore, when the Outlaw lands in the last section, it triggers a &ldquo;Final Shootout&rdquo;! In this special phase, all of the players must defend themselves against the Outlaw&rsquo;s bold attack by using gunmen positioned on Main Street. If the players beat the Outlaw, they gain additional Victory Points as a reward. But if they fail, they must send their lost gunmen to their early graves in the Union Cemetery&hellip;&#10;&#10;The Wild West theme of the game is based closely on the California Gold Rush of 1849 through the turn of the century. The city of Placerville, also known as Old Hangtown, has a rich history, which has been worked into the game at every juncture. For instance, the town cards feature historic landmarks such as the Bell Tower, Soda Works, and Studebaker Wheelbarrow Shop; while the periodic &ldquo;Events&rdquo; feature the Wagon Train, mail delivery from Snowshoe Thompson, and digging up The Mother Lode at Gold Bug Mine. Many beautifully restored historic photographs and illustrations are included as well.&#10;&#10;Hangtown plays wonderfully with two to six players, and it can be set to play in two separate modes: Discovery for newcomers and casual gamers, and Highgrade for seasoned gamers and experienced players. The modes appeal to a wide range of folks and settings&mdash;from light family fun to heavy brain burning. The game also includes an expansion that opens up bidding on several character roles. These roles, such as the Robber, Deputy, Prospector, and Gunslinger, allow each player to use a unique special ability for one entire round at a time.&#10;&#10;The game offers many paths to victory and great replayability.&#10;&#10;",

All the Royalist infantry, except the Swiss, was put in disorder. The attacks and counter-attacks would continue until Guise and Saint-Andr&eacute;&rsquo;s troops, passive until that point, overwhelmed the Huguenots. At the end of the day, almost all the commanders of the two camps were killed or taken prisoner. Despite the Protestant rout, the war would continue for a long time !&#10;&#10;- La Roche l&rsquo;Abeille 1569&#10;After the assassination of the Prince of Cond&eacute; at Jarnac during the third French War of Religion, Coligny regrouped the Protestant forces near the Vienne. He managed to surprise the Duke of Anjou, who had set off in pursuit of him, despite his strong defensive position. At dawn, Coligny&rsquo;s avant-garde progressed through hedges and thickets. The Royalist infantry, knocked about by the Protestant cavaliers, was beaten and their commander, Filippo Strozzi, taken prisoner. This victory would be a limited and fleeting one.&#10;&#10;- Coutras 1587&#10;The eighth and final French War of Religion began with Henri of Navarre's first battle as commander in chief. Faced with the Royalist troops commanded by the Duke of Joyeuse, &ldquo;Premier mignon du Roy&rdquo;, Navarre took advantage of the night to position his troops near Coutras. At ten o&rsquo;clock, the charge of the Royalist gendarmes hit the first line of Huguenot cavalry despite the deadly fire of the artillery commanded by Sully. But the counter-charge of Navarre, Cond&eacute; and Soissons shifted the course of the battle and destroyed the morale of Joyeuse&rsquo;s troops. The ensuing massacre caused the deaths of Joyeuse, his brother, and numerous other noblemen.&#10;&#10;See Avec Infini Regret wiki&#10;&#10;",

Planetary Reign is a space civilization game based on classic video games of the same genre from the 1980's and 90's in which each player is the leader of a space-faring empire that is attempting to expand into and exploit the riches of a new-found galaxy. Planetary Reign provides a rich 4X experience without an overly complex rule-set and can be played within a couple of hours.&#10;&#10;As a leader of THULE, VEYNA, METHIOS or CALDERA, you will assign your workers to a variety of actions - choosing which, when and how often they will be performed - with the ultimate goal being to dominate the galaxy and ensure the survival of your people. Your empire will build, upgrade and send its fleets into a galaxy to explore its unknown worlds. There, you will encounter planets with strange environments, hosts of alien species and a variety of resources as well as occasionally running into your opponents.&#10;&#10;The main mechanics employed in Planetary Reign are worker placement, area control and a new specie assimilation mechanic. With nearly 5 years in development, Planetary Reign has been designed for players who enjoy medium to heavy games with low luck factors. There are multiple scoring paths and rounds - the winner being the empire with the most points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;",

Then the youngest player begins by taking at random any card from the player to his left in the hope of matching a new pair. If he makes a pair with this new card, he places it face up on the table, and takes another card from the same player to his left. If not he keeps the card and the next player takes his turn and play continues thus, until there are no more pairs. Gradually as &#10;the game progresses the players are able to assemble the Misti&rsquo;zzle a tableau presenting images of the stories of Jean de La Fontaine.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Was kommt dazu (What's added now) is a tile laying game.&#10;&#10;It consists of 72 square cardboard tiles, similar to the tiles of a memory game, and a rulebook. There are 6 tile series with different pictures. 3 series of 16 tiles each (steamboat, wonder machine, sun flower), 2 series of 9 tiles each (flowers of the spring, bird), 1 series of 6 tiles (helicopter). The basic idea is that one tile of each series has the least amount of small details, another one the greatest amount of details (like with or without doorknow depicted, a bee with or without wings etc.). These cards must be sorted according to the amount of details picted from least to most in ascending order. A check is possible by turing the tiles around. On each tile back is one half of an animal or thing - horse, train car etc. If the cards are in correct order those halves match.&#10;&#10;The rulebook suggests 3 games:&#10;1) Solo game: The solo player takes one or more tile series, shuffles them and must lay them in the correct order. &#10;2) Group game: The short helicopter series is done away with. Each player gets one tile series (well shuffled). Players start to put their series in order. The first player to do this wins - if he did correctly. This can be done with one round or in several rounds. If rounds are played the player who finishes first and has his order correct he gets victory points equal to the number of tiles in the series plus 5 extra points. The other players get one victory point for each tile that is in correct order. For the next round the series are shuffled again and each player gets another series than before.&#10;3) What is disappeared: A series is laid on the table in random order. The picture with the most details is laid in the middle. Players look out for the tile where just one little detail disappeared then the next one etc.&#10;&#10;",

Each platform is worth a different point value from 10 to 40 points. If you land on a gray base or get stuck on a branch, you score no points. If your frog lands on the table or anywhere besides the game base, pick it up and try again. To launch a frog, press down on its rear to fling it forward. As your finger slips off, the frog should jump toward the platforms. Once all frogs are somewhere on the game base, the game ends. Count up your points, and the player with the most points wins. This game is for two to four players. It comes with a Kung Fu Training Center game base, 20 frogs (five of each color), and a sticker sheet.&#10;&#10;",

When a book is collected you unlock one of the characters from that book to use in part two. Good unlocks good. Evil unlocks evil. For example if Shay were to reach the novel Dracula first he'd unlock Van Helsing! If the Master were to reach Dracula first he'd unlock Dracula. Once all of the books are collected, and their characters unlocked, part two begins.&#10;&#10;Careful there are skirmishes along the way that may set you back! Play a Battle Point Card, and draw your enemy into battle. Loser loses a turn. Winner gets an extra chance to draw an unlock-able card. Weapons and characters are hidden within the deck. A chance at unlocking them makes drawing from the deck even more exciting.&#10;&#10;In part two you take all of your unlocked characters and battle by rolling dice.

Every decision and every action is set against a backdrop of dwindling time and rising concern.&#10;For a long time, we were at war with The Jackals. But now, we&rsquo;ve driven them off, and we have this &ndash; a year of relative peace. One quiet year, with which to build our community up and learn once again how to work together. Come Winter, the Frost Shepherds will arrive and we might not survive beyond that. But we don&rsquo;t know about that yet. What we know is that right now, in this moment, there is an opportunity to build something.&#10;&#10;The game plays through a year of relative peace for a small post-apocalyptic community. Players take turns playing through weeks in this year. Each week, the active player draws a card from the top of the deck (which represents the year), and reads the card. They carry out the actions or answer the questions that are specified on the card. Once the card is resolved, some quick upkeep occurs: projects that the community has in motion get closer to completion. Finally, the active player picks an action from a short list: hold a discussion, make a decision, discover something new.&#10;&#10;The three actions give players a meaningful and difficult set of choices: do you spend time listening to others, in the hopes that they'll listen to you in kind? Do you pursue your own goals, ostensibly for the good of the whole community? Do you focus inward or outward?&#10;&#10;The game is played using a deck of cards &ndash; each of the 52 cards corresponds to a week during the quiet year. Each card triggers certain events &ndash; bringing bad news, good omens, project delays and sudden changes in luck. At the end of the quiet year, the Frost Shepherds will come, ending the game.&#10;&#10;",

The dividends are paid out to shareholders of certain railroads based on how many cities/towns they connect to and how many shares of this company have been issued. The upgrade and dividend actions also affect game length and the likelihood of further dividends for each company. The game ends when a certain condition is met at the end of a player's turn, and the player with the highest sum of money and stock value at the end of this turn wins.&#10;&#10;Irish Gauge is the first title in the Iron Rail series by Capstone Games.&#10;&#10;",

When a druid is moved, he usually leaves a stone behind, and in this way stone circles are eventually created on the board. Each time a player gains the stone majority within such a circle, he places a dolmen with a hidden number (1 to 4) in its center. Over time, stacks of dolmen grow all across the board.&#10;&#10;The game ends as soon as any player runs out of dolmen or stones. For each dolmen a player has placed, he scores a number of points that depends on the dolmen's position within its stack as well as the size of the circle surrounding it. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Dead Drop is a game that involves elements of memory, deduction, and crafty maneuvering. As secret agents working for different organizations, players scour the globe seeking information that will help them find the location of a hidden explosive device. Agents must trade information and sell secrets in order to learn the location of the device and grab it before it falls into the hands of another agency! On a player's turn, you must choose one of the following actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Share Info: Trade one card from your hand with one card from any other agent. The target agent must trade and may not look at the card she is being given before handing over her card to the active agent.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Hack the Cache: Trade one card from your hand with one card in the cache. The card from your hand becomes a part of the cache and should be face up.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Sell Secrets: Reveal two cards from your hand to another agent, who must then answer &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; to reveal whether or not she has a card equal to the sum of those cards. If she says &quot;yes&quot;, she must hand a card of that value to the active agent in exchange for one of the cards shown. The active agent chooses which card to hand over.&#10;&#10;&#10;At the end of a turn, after performing a regular action, the active agent may choose to Grab The Drop: Place two cards from your hand face up next to the card in the middle of the table. Then, secretly look at the card in the middle to determine whether this card is equal to the sum of the two face-up cards. If you guessed correctly, you win the round; if you're wrong, you're out of the round. (In a three- or four-player game, if an agent is eliminated, she must place her cards face up in front of her. Other agents may trade with an eliminated agent's cards by placing the card traded from their hand face up in place of the card they take.) The first player to win three rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;Dead Drop includes three sets of cards with different artwork (Spies, Monsters, and Kids). Dead Drop Deluxe features the same gameplay as Dead Drop, but it includes eight decks of cards instead of three, each illustrated by a different artist with a different theme. These extra sets are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Vikings (by Naomi Robinson)&#10;    Outlaws (by Oliver Meinerding)&#10;    Birds (by Ashley Davis)&#10;    Rogues (by Rob Lundy)&#10;    Robots (by Sean Dove)&#10;&#10;&#10;Dead Drop Deluxe contains a cloth travel bag and silkscreened wooden tokens instead of plain cubes, and it comes packaged in a UV coated box sleeve.&#10;&#10;",

Picture a grandma bragging about sexting or a redneck evaluating the finer points of an isosceles triangle. Each game comes complete with 40 Accent Cards and 460 Phrase Cards. Sometimes the phrases pair well with the accents, but for the most part they don&rsquo;t &mdash; and that&rsquo;s Utter Nonsense.&#10;&#10;How You Play&#10;&#10;The game consists of Accent Cards and Phrase Cards that players combine and act out. Sometimes phrases pair well with the accent, but more often, they don&rsquo;t &mdash; and that&rsquo;s Utter Nonsense.&#10;&#10;1. Each game set has 40 Accent Cards and 460 Phrase Cards.&#10;2. All players have 7 Phrase Cards.&#10;3. One player serves as the Nonsense Judge and selects the Accent Card for the round.&#10;4. Once the Accent Card is revealed, players select one Phrase Card from their hand, and say it in the accent indicated.&#10;5. It&rsquo;s up to the Nonsense Judge to decide which player&rsquo;s phrase and accent combination is the funniest, and that player wins the round.&#10;6. After a player wins 5 rounds, that player wins the game.&#10;&#10;You don&rsquo;t have to be good at accents and the combinations don&rsquo;t need to make sense; in fact, we encourage players to make the Phrase Cards their own. With each successive round, competition sets in and the most composed, mild mannered players become improv masters.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Pandemic Legacy is a co-operative campaign game, with an overarching story-arc played through 12-24 sessions, depending on how well your group does at the game. At the beginning, the game starts very similar to basic Pandemic, in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world, treating disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.&#10;&#10;During a player's turn, they have four actions available, with which they may travel around in the world in various ways (sometimes needing to discard a card), build structures like research stations, treat diseases (removing one cube from the board; if all cubes of a color have been removed, the disease has been eradicated), trade cards with other players, or find a cure for a disease (requiring five cards of the same color to be discarded while at a research station). Each player has a unique role with special abilities to help them at these actions.&#10;&#10;After a player has taken their actions, they draw two cards. These cards can include epidemic cards, which will place new disease cubes on the board, and can lead to an outbreak, spreading disease cubes even further. Outbreaks additionally increase the panic level of a city, making that city more expensive to travel to.&#10;&#10;Each month in the game, you have two chances to achieve that month's objectives. If you succeed, you win and immediately move on to the next month. If you fail, you have a second chance, with more funding for beneficial event cards.&#10;&#10;During the campaign, new rules and components will be introduced. These will sometimes require you to permanently alter the components of the game; this includes writing on cards, ripping up cards, and placing permanent stickers on components. Your characters can gain new skills, or detrimental effects. A character can even be lost entirely, at which point it's no longer available for play.&#10;&#10;Part of the Pandemic series&#10;&#10;",

When you hit your ball, you choose a direction and a strength and then roll custom dice to see how far the ball goes: Softly (1,1,1,2,2,3), Fairly (1,3,4,5,6,8), or Wicked Hard (Both dice added together)&#10;&#10;Pass your ball through each wicket in the correct order and direction and hit the ending post to gain the &quot;Poison&quot; Power Boost.

Unfortunately, soon after its founding, figures of intrigue nicknamed the &quot;Watchers&quot; appeared all over the realm of Chos&#197;&#143;n. Since then, feud and disorder has sprouted everywhere, but instead of the usual political contests and sneaky manipulations, armed warfare has become the rule. The influence of the &quot;Watchers&quot; on some families has grown strong, and some whisper that their extraordinary powers even allow them to travel through time...&#10;&#10;Chos&#197;&#143;n is a thematic sequel to Kory&#197;&#143; set in the same uchronian and politico-steampunk universe, and gameplay is similar in the two games.&#10;&#10;The game lasts eight rounds, and in each round, each player draws a specified number of cards, then simultaneously plays face down (1) as many characters as desired from one family, (2) one character from each of two different families, (3) one character and one event card, or (4) three event cards. Each family has a value ranging from 1 to 9, which indicates both the number of cards in the family and the number of victory points the player controlling this family will score at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Players reveal their cards in order clockwise from the round's start player. If she played one character and one event, she carries out the power of this event, swapping two characters or eliminating one held by another player. She also carries out the powers of any family that she controls, i.e., that she holds more cards of than any other player. The family powers let you protect one family, keep event cards, double the power of an event, steal the first player token, etc. At the end of each round, players discard characters in play (if needed) and discard everything in hand.&#10;&#10;After eight rounds, players tally their scores based on the families they control, influence scored during the game, and possession of Yi's Legacy, which is acquired by playing three event cards. Whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "&ldquo;According to Norse myth, Fenrir the wolf was the third son of Loki and the giantess Angrboda. It was prophesied that Fenrir would one day devour Odin ushering in Ragnarok. Tyr the god of war took it upon himself to feed Fenrir while he was still a pup, but as time went on Fenrir grew larger as did the gods' fear of him. The gods then decided to bind the wolf with a fetter they called Leyding. The wolf easily broke free of his bonds. The gods then used another fetter called Dromi and once again to no avail. Receiving word of this Odin called upon the dwarves of Svartalfheim to fashion a fetter made up of six magic ingredients, they called this ribbon-like material Gleipnir. Once bound with Gleipnir, Fenrir was unable to break free&hellip;&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Object of the game&#10;The players &ldquo;Viking gods&rdquo; win if they manage to collect 3 of the 4 sets of Fetter tiles; otherwise the players lose if Fenrir reaches Odin first.&#10;&#10;Components&#10;1 Fenrir wolf figure&#10;&#10;4 chips in four colors, 1-red, 1-blue, 1-green and 1-yellow&#10;&#10;4 Viking god figures in four colors, 1-red, 1-blue, 1-green and 1-yellow&#10;&#10;25 square tiles comprised of 1 Odin tile and 24 Fetter tiles in four colors, 6-red, 6-blue, 6-green and 6-yellow&#10;&#10;1 draw bag&#10;&#10;Setup&#10;Pick a color you&rsquo;d like to play as and place a chip in that color in front of yourself.&#10;&#10;The chips color also corresponds to the color of the Viking god that you will move in the game.&#10;&#10;The Odin tile is the start tile place this tile face up onto the table.&#10;&#10;Then place all 24 fetter tiles into the draw bag and shuffle them; draw one tile at a time from the bag and form a path of face up adjacent tiles that lead away from the start tile.&#10;&#10;Next place the four gods into the draw bag, draw a god from the bag placing one on every 5th tile along the path.&#10;&#10;Lastly place the wolf figure onto the last tile of the path; the wolf figure should face the path looking towards the Odin tile.&#10;&#10;Now you&rsquo;re ready to play!&#10;&#10;How to play&#10;The youngest player starts.&#10;&#10;A player on his turn must, following the movement rules&hellip;&#10;&#10;&bull; Move his piece either forwards or backwards along the path and ending the move on an empty tile not of his color or&#10;&bull; Move forwards or backwards along the path and collect a tile in his color.&#10;&#10;After a player&rsquo;s turn, he calls out who&rsquo;s turn is next by player color only, although this is a co-operative game players are not to help each other by verbally coordinating there moves.&#10;&#10;Tile collection&#10;A player on his turn collects a tile in their color by landing on it with their piece. Tiles are not removed from the path but instead are flipped over and the god that last moved is placed on top.&#10;&#10;The game ends when any three of the four sets of color tiles have been collected or when Fenrir reaches the Odin tile.&#10;&#10;Movement&#10;The gods can move in three possible ways:&#10;&#10;&bull; Walking&#10;&bull; Long jump&#10;&bull; Leapfrog&#10;&#10;Walking&#10;&#10;To walk, simply move your god to an empty adjacent tile.&#10;&#10;Long jump&#10;&#10;A god may long jump over another god or even the wolf.&#10;&#10;&bull; When performing a long jump you must land an equal distance after the jumped piece as at the start of the jump, so for example, if the piece doing the jumping is four spaces away from the piece you're jumping over, you must land four spaces away from the piece being jumped.&#10;&#10;&bull; You can only jump one god at the start of a long jump.&#10;&#10;&bull; Multiple long jumps in a single direction are allowed per turn.&#10;&#10;Leapfrog&#10;&#10;A god may leapfrog over another adjacent god or the wolf ending the jump on an empty tile immediately beyond the jumped piece.&#10;&#10;Multiple leapfrog jumps in a single direction are allowed per turn.&#10;&#10;Restrictions&#10;No two gods may occupy the same tile nor may a god move onto a tile that the wolf is on.&#10;&#10;The gods are also forbidden to leave the path.&#10;&#10;Wolf movement&#10;&#10;The wolf moves either two tiles forwards or one tile back along the path, but its movements are dictated by what the player&rsquo;s actions are after a turn.&#10;&#10;&bull; If a player&rsquo;s piece moves onto a tile that&rsquo;s not in his color, the wolf moves two tiles forward.&#10;&bull; If a player&rsquo;s piece moves onto a tile that&rsquo;s in the players color, the wolf moves one tile back.&#10;&#10;When Fenrir moves onto a tile occupied by a god the wolf takes his place and the god is moved to the start tile.&#10;&#10;",

If you take a beer card, you must immediately carry out the task given on it, after which you place the card on the bottom of the deck. Each finger of beer that you drink (approx. 2cm) counts as one point. A Killer counts as five points if you empty the glass in one go, or three points if you take your time. If you ail a task, it will cost you five points. Leaving the table without the permission if the other players or beyond the scope of a task costs you ten points.

At the start of each day, the market is seeded with new gems, gold and prestige cards, with the stores holding only items of the same type and bazaar booths holding whatever comes to them. A new noble visits the market each day, offering a special power to whoever wants to pay for the privilege, with his price dropping each day.&#10;&#10;Each player chooses one of the seven action cards in hand, then they resolve them in order of who has the most gold. They then do this twice more, getting discounts now for the cost of taking certain actions. The action cards let you earn gold, take all the cards from one store or bazaar booth, hire a noble, swap gems, protect yourself for inspections in case you have fake gems, copy your previously played action, or (most important of all) sell gems.&#10;&#10;In addition to points from nobles and prestige cards, most of your score will come from gems that you sell &mdash; but you need to sell the right gems in the right way. When selling to a jeweler, you need to sell four different types of gems (or three types and gold), but you score only for one of the gem cards sold; when selling to a collector, you sell gems of only one type, but you have to hold the most gems of that type and you score only the difference between what you hold and what the player with the secondmost gems of this type holds. Status matters in the collector community!&#10;&#10;Whoever has the most prestige points after ten days wins.&#10;&#10;",

Our armymals are very special creatures: They drive tanks and have strong personalities just like the noble leaders of the past. In Armymals you will meet dozens of characters like Narwhaleon Bonaparte, Abrahamster Lincoln, and Lionidas &ndash; each with its own unique artwork and thematic abilities. The game is an action packed, fast strategy experience. Brightly colored tanks move across a hexagon-tiled battlefield filled with three-dimensional scenery representing trees, barns etc. The colorful board and the cute animals with a twist of historical characters make the game accessible to kids and hilarious to adults. We used the same principle while creating the rules, they have an increasing complexity to ensure fun for both beginners and hardcore players.&#10;&#10;Armymals uses an intuitive system based on a set of unique dice and cards to generate a different choice of actions each turn. Animals in tanks are able to carry out many orders: moving, shooting, accumulating energy, using character skills, and more. To win, players have to collect victory points, which come from completing operations that are chosen at the beginning of the game and can be different each time. Depending on the active operations, players will have to destroy enemy tanks, capture the flag, control strategic locations, complete crazy tasks from mission deck, and more.&#10;&#10;",

Points can be earned in various ways, but most points are earned by publishing theories &ndash; correct theories, that is &mdash; and therein lies the problem.&#10;&#10;The game is played in six rounds. At the beginning of the round, players choose their play order. Those who choose to play later get more rewards.&#10;Players declare all their actions by placing cubes on the various action spaces, then each action space is evaluated in order. Players gain knowledge by mixing ingredients and testing the results using a smartphone app (iOS, Android, and also Windows) that randomizes the rules of alchemy for each new game. And if the alchemists are longing for something even more special, they can always buy magical artifacts to get an extra push. There are 9 of them (different for each game) and they are not only very powerful, but also very expensive. But money means nothing, when there's academic pride at stake! And the possession of these artifacts will definitely earn you some reputation too. Players can also earn money by selling potions of questionable quality to adventurers, but money is just a means to an end. The alchemists don't want riches, after all. They want respect, and respect usually comes from publishing theories.&#10;&#10;During play, players' reputations will go up and down. After six rounds and a final exhibition, reputation will be converted into points. Points will also be scored for artifacts and grants. Then the secrets of alchemy are revealed and players score points or lose points based on whether their theories were correct. Whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Flavor text:&#10;Mandrake root and scorpion tail; spongy mushroom and warty toad &mdash; these are the foundations of the alchemist's livelihood, science, and art.&#10;&#10;But what arcane secrets do these strange ingredients hide? Now it is time to find out. Mix them into potions and drink them to determine their effects &mdash; or play it safe and test the concoction on a helpful assistant! Gain riches selling potions to wandering adventurers and invest these riches in powerful artifacts. As your knowledge grows, so will your reputation, as you publish your theories for all to see. Knowledge, wealth, and fame can all be found in the murky depths of the alchemist's cauldron.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Steampunk Rally is a strategy game that incorporates steampunk as more than just a bit of chrome. Using a unique dice-placement mechanism, players take on the roles of famous inventors from the turn of the last century like Nikola Tesla and Marie Curie, constructing fantastical contraptions that make use of steam, heat and electricity in an attempt to win a no-holds-barred race through the Swiss alps.&#10;&#10;Each round starts with a card draft in which players carefully select machine parts to add to their invention and one-shot boost cards to aid them or hinder opponents. Players also have the option of discarding drafted cards for dice or cogs to power their invention, but they must make this tricky choice when each card is drafted.&#10;&#10;Then, after venting dice to revitalize their machines, players roll their dice and use them to activate machine parts which provide things like movement, shielding, and additional dice with which to activate more parts. Driving through terrain causes damage, and if a player's damage gauge ends up in the red at the end of the turn, they must lose parts from their invention. These will need to be replaced in the draft phase, constantly forcing players to discover new synergies.&#10;&#10;",

Turns represent 3 months during the winter and 2 months during the summer, with four Action Phases to each turn.&#10;&#10;Military forces are represented by generals and strength-points (SPs). Each SP represents approximately 5,000 soldiers. Game mechanics stress strategy, maneuver and leadership but details like ironclads, naval battles, leader promotions, forts, and commerce raiders are included.&#10;&#10;Shorter scenarios are included that cover just 1861, 1862 and 1863.&#10;&#10;Players of Eric Lee Smith&rsquo;s The Civil War (VG) and Mark Herman&rsquo;s For the People (AH and GMT) will see many similarities between this game and those two benchmark games.

Schnupperspiel is a small, promotional copy of 6 nimmt! containing 24 cards and playable for 2 to 4 players.&#10;&#10;The game plays very similar to 6 nimmt! except that the cards here are numbered 1 through 24. With 2 players, each player will be dealt a hand of 10 cards, but for 3 or 4 players, each player starts with 7 or 5 cards, respectively. 3 of the remaining cards form the rows where players will play their cards. Players simultaneously select a card to play and will add their cards to the rows in ascending order. If a player selects a card that is so low it cannot be added to any series, that player takes a row of cards and the low card begins a new row. Each row can contain at most 5 cards. The player that places the 6th card must take the other cards in the row and the 6th card is used to start a new row.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to have the lowest score at the end of 4 rounds. Rounds end after all cards have been played. Players score points for each ox head present on the cards they collect.&#10;&#10;",

Players roll and move around the board. At specific points they have the opportunity to acquire properties that allow them to collect rent from other players, or to collect dividends on owned properties; answering trivia questions may be necessary to take these actions or increase their effectiveness. There are also event cards that may require players to answer questions to determine what happens, event spaces that require players to play a game of chance for property ownership, and more. The game may be played until one player goes bankrupt, until all players but one go bankrupt, or for a predetermined amount of time.&#10;&#10;",

It consists in 300 round cards, each one containing a brief note on a historical event related to the Catalan language and a challenge for the players. There are 10 different kinds of challenges: to create anagrams, to find words, to define words, to identify acronyms, to guess word meanings, etc.&#10;&#10;In a game, 30 cards are selected at random: these will be the challenges to the players; and each player begins with 300 points. The game is played in turns. In a player's turn, he/she draws one of the 30 cards and reads the brief historical note and the kind of challenge. Then all players bet points to solve the challenge, before actually knowing the challenge (they just know its kind). After deducting the points bet of each player, the active player reads the challenge and the players try to solve it. All players having solved the challenge receive double the points they bet, while the higher better receives three times the points bet; the players not having solved the challenge receive nothing. After the 30 challenges have been played, the player with most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "RULES&#10;2-4 Players. Age +6 years&#10;&#10;DESCRIPTION&#10;At first sight, memm appears to be a simple game as it is composed by only 36 geometric cubes of different colours. However, memm goes far beyond this apparent simplicity. memm is a dynamic, visually entertaining and aesthetically attractive  game, but above all, memm  is game full of possibilities and lots of game play. These characteristics makes memm the ideal cognitive development game to play with the whole family.&#10;&#10;PREPARATION&#10;The 36 coloured cubes are placed on the table, mixed and shared equally amongst the participants. Then a cube with all the six colours is rolled. The player having the cube with the resulting colour on all its 6 sides will start the game by placing this cube in the centre of the table.&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY&#10;Clockwise, the following players will place one cube so that joining sides match colours.  A cube can be placed on top of the starting cube. However, this move will be subject to a special rule that will be discussed in the SPECIAL RULE section.&#10;&#10;ABILITY TO REPEAT TURN&#10;A player gains the ability to repeat turn if he joins a cube by two sides. Please note this is only physically possible as from the fourth turn.&#10;A player gains the ability to repeat turn and get rid of one of his cubes by handing it to a player of his choice if he joins a cube by three sides.&#10;A player gains the ability to repeat turn and get rid of two of his cubes by handing them to a player of his choice if he joins a cube by four sides.&#10;&#10;If a player joins a cube by five sides, gains the ability to repeat turn and get rid of three of his cubes by handing them to a player of his choice.&#10;&#10;SPECIAL RULE&#10;No more than three cubes will be placed in the same direction in a row of turns. This rule prevents the formation of continuous lines of cubes and is not to be confused with a limitation of the central structure being developed during the game. When a player places a cube on top of another, the player will have, on his next turn, the possibility of you can also put it in one of the free sides of any of the cubes that are in the same vertical.&#10;&#10;OBJECTIVE&#10;The first player who gets rid of all his cubes wins the game. However, unless this player is the last to play in the round, the remaining players will be placing their cubes until the full round of turns is completed. At that point, the player left with more cubes loses. In a tie in number of cubes , you will lose more different colours have. If they have the same number of colours , the result will be a tie.&#10;&#10;VARIATIONS OF THE GAME&#10;This is the basic and general form of the game. Nevertheless, a number of variants were also explored to create a series of dimensional figures that would condition the placement of cubes. Some examples are detailed in the photo section. &#10;A rotating circular table can be added to the game to facilitate players with the different angles and spatial perspective of the figure being created and gain fluency and aesthetics in the game.&#10;Specification (Components, forms, materials, sizes):&#10;Components : game box , instructions , manual with different figures to make and 36 cubes with the following distribution of coloured sides :&#10;6 cubes with all sides the same colour.&#10;6 cubes with 5 sides of the same colour and with a different side.&#10;6 cubes with 4 sides of the same colour and with 2 different sides.&#10;6 cubes with 3 sides of the same colour and with 3 different sides.&#10;6 cubes with 2 sides of the same colour and with 4 different sides.&#10;6 cubes with all sides of different colour.&#10;&#10;In principle, the chosen colours are red , yellow , orange , violet, blue and green.&#10;&#10;Each cube will have on each side a roman number that determines the number of sides with that colour. For example, a &quot;V&quot; on the a red face of a cube means that there are 5 red sides on that cube.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;1 Descripci&oacute;n de memm: Jugadores: de 2 a 4. Edad: +6 a&ntilde;os.&#10;memm aparenta ser un juego sencillo por tratarse s&oacute;lo de 36 cubos geom&eacute;tricos de diferentes colores, pero va m&aacute;s all&aacute; de esa aparente sencillez. memm es un juego con multitud de posibilidades, din&aacute;mico, muy est&eacute;tico (al quedar figuras de colores incre&iacute;bles), entretenido y, sobre todo, con much&iacute;sima jugabilidad.&#10;&#10;2 Instrucciones&#10;Se colocan los 36 cubos de colores en la mesa, se remueven y se reparten equitativamente entre los jugadores participantes. Se lanza un cubo con un color diferente en cada cara y empieza el que tenga el cubo con las 6 caras del color que haya salido. Se comienza la partida situando el cubo en el centro de la mesa. El siguiente jugador (los turnos se realizan en orden del sentido de las agujas del reloj) tendr&aacute; que colocar una de las caras de los cubos que le ha tocado en una de las caras libres del &uacute;ltimo cubo puesto en la mesa. Esta uni&oacute;n de caras s&oacute;lo se podr&aacute; realizar si coinciden en su color. Los jugadores podr&aacute;n situar el cubo en la cara superior, pero esta acci&oacute;n estar&aacute; sujeta a una regla especial de la secci&oacute;n 3. Se proceder&aacute; de la misma manera en turnos siguientes con las siguientes condiciones:&#10; 3 Posibilidad de repetici&oacute;n de turno&#10;&#10;Cubo toca una sola cara con &uacute;ltimo cubo puesto: no coloca ning&uacute;n cubo m&aacute;s y pasa a siguiente jugador seg&uacute;n turno.&#10;&#10;Cubo en la mesa toca dos caras con &uacute;ltimo cubo puesto: posibilidad de colocar otro cubo de nuevo.&#10;&#10;Cubo en la mesa toca tres caras con &uacute;ltimo cubo puesto: posibilidad de colocar otro cubo de nuevo y puede deshacerse de un cubo suyo, entreg&aacute;ndoselo al jugador que crea conveniente.&#10;&#10;Cubo en la mesa toca cuatro caras con &uacute;ltimo cubo puesto: posibilidad de colocar otro cubo de nuevo y puede deshacerse de dos cubos suyos, entreg&aacute;ndoselos al jugador o jugadores que crea conveniente.&#10;&#10;Cubo en la mesa toca cinco caras con &uacute;ltimo cubo puesto: posibilidad de colocar otro cubo de nuevo y puede deshacerse de tres cubos suyos, entreg&aacute;ndoselos al jugador o jugadores  que crea conveniente.&#10;&#10;4 Reglas especiales&#10;No se podr&aacute; colocar m&aacute;s de tres cubos en turnos seguidos en la misma direcci&oacute;n. Esta regla evita la formaci&oacute;n de una l&iacute;nea interminable de cubos y no debe ser confundida con una limitaci&oacute;n de las dimensiones de la estructura a formar durante el juego.&#10;&#10;Cuando un jugador coloca un cubo sobre otro cubo en cualquier nivel de la estructura, el mismo jugador (en caso de uni&oacute;n de 2 o m&aacute;s caras) o el siguiente jugador (en caso de uni&oacute;n de una sola cara) deber&aacute; colocar su cubo de tal manera que haga contacto con la vertical sobre la que descansa ese cubo, incluyendo &eacute;ste.&#10;&#10;5 Objetivo final&#10;Un jugador ganar&aacute; la partida cuando sea el primero en deshacerse de todos sus cubos, aunque deber&aacute; esperar a que el &uacute;ltimo jugador de esa ronda haya completado su turno. Es decir, el resto de jugadores  podr&aacute;n colocar sus cubos e incluso entregar sus cubos a cualquier contrincante hasta la finalizaci&oacute;n esa ronda.. En ese momento, perder&aacute; el que se haya quedado con m&aacute;s cubos. Si hay empate en n&uacute;mero de cubos, perder&aacute; el que m&aacute;s colores diferentes posea. Si tienen el mismo n&uacute;mero de colores, habr&aacute; empate en dicho jugadores.&#10;&#10;Esta es la modalidad b&aacute;sica y general del juego. Pero se pens&oacute; en las miles de posibilidades de unas piezas tan vers&aacute;tiles. Por lo que se empez&oacute; a crear una serie de figuras ficticias para delimitar la colocaci&oacute;n de los cubos. Se detallar&aacute; alg&uacute;n ejemplo en la secci&oacute;n de fotos. Tambi&eacute;n se puede incorporar al juego una &#10;tabla circular giratoria para as&iacute; facilitar la visi&oacute;n espacial de la figura desde cualquier perspectiva y de paso agilizar el juego.&#10;&#10;Memoria descriptiva (Componentes, formas, materiales, medidas):&#10;&#10;6 Componentes&#10;Caja de juego, instrucciones, manual con las diferentes figuras a realizar y 36 cubos con la siguiente distribuci&oacute;n de caras de colores:&#10;&#10;6 cubos con todas las caras de un mismo color.&#10;6 cubos con 5 caras de un mismo color y con una cara de color diferente.&#10;6 cubos con 4 caras de un mismo color y con 2 caras de color diferente.&#10;6 cubos con 3 caras de un mismo color y con 3 caras de color diferente.&#10;6 cubos con 2 caras de un mismo color y con 4 caras de color diferente.&#10;6 cubos con todas sus caras de color diferente.&#10;En principio, los colores elegidos son el rojo, amarillo, naranja, violeta, azul y  verde.&#10;&#10;Cada cubo tendr&aacute; en cada cara un n&uacute;mero en romano que determina el n&uacute;mero de caras que tiene ese color en el cubo. Por ejemplo, si en una cara roja de un cubo se encuentra una &ldquo;V&rdquo;, significar&aacute; que en ese cubo hay 5 caras rojas.&#10;&#10;",

You and other Private Eyes will take turns questioning witnesses to get clues from them. You can try and feed the witness some information in hopes of jogging their memory, but you risk pushing them too hard.&#10;&#10;If you aren't careful, the witness will crack and feed you false information, which sets back your investigation. The first detective to collect 15 clues catches the serial killer and solves the case.&#10;&#10;The first player will reveal a witness card and roll a D10. Add the value of the D10 with the number on the witness card to get the witness value. This represents the stress the witness will be able to endure before cracking. Each player's goal is to get as close to the witness value without going over.&#10;&#10;Each player in turn order chooses to roll 1-5 of their D6. If their roll turns out lower than desired, the player may pay a clue to roll an additional die to add to the value. If a player exceeds the witness value, the witness cracks under pressure and gives bad information, causing the offending player to lose two clues. After all players have rolled, the player who is closest to the witness value without cracking the witness gains clues equal to the number of dice they rolled.&#10;&#10;The game ends once any player gets 15 or more clues at the end of a round.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Ninja Taisen is a two-player, dice-driven open information abstract game with a random set-up. Both players have identical sets of ten fighters, with three fighters in each of three colors with values 1&ndash;3 along with a tri-colored boss valued at 4; these fighters are placed in small stacks of varying size onto a line that's eleven steps long. On a player's turn, he rolls the three colored dice and can make up to three moves accordingly, with the blue die moving a blue fighter, etc. Moving a fighter that has other fighters on top of him moves these other fighters as well.&#10;&#10;If, as a result of movement, his fighter (or stack of fighters) encounters an enemy, a fight between the two top cards in each stack occurs, the result of which is decided primarily by the color (via a rock-paper-scissors mechanism) and secondarily by the number (highest wins). If the boss wins a fight, its power is reduced by the enemy's power for the remainder of the current fight; if two fighters draw, they both retreat one step toward their own village, possibly precipitating other fights on the same turn. The fight continues until either pile is depleted.&#10;&#10;The first player to either defeat all of the opposing fighters or reach the end of the line (and clear out the opponent's fighters in his village) wins.&#10;&#10;",

Players shoot their 'balls' (wooden disks) from the numbered tee spots and aim for the equivalent numbered 'hole' (cup depression.)&#10;&#10;There are two ways to play. In the first version, each player plays each hole one at a time keeping track of his shots. At the end of 18 holes the player with the fewest strokes wins. For a more interactive game, players alternate taking shots, thus allowing chances to block off holes or knock other players balls out of position. In this version the first player to complete the course is the winner.&#10;&#10;This original game by World Wide Games would later be republished as Bumper Golf after an acquisition by S&amp;S Worldwide.&#10;&#10;",

The game is played on the dark squares only, and each wing of the board has twelve dark squares to host twelve pieces in their starting positions.  There are pieces of four colors: black, white, red, and green.  Each player chooses a partner and their own color, and sets up their pieces in starting positions opposite the board from each other.  Play proceeds clockwise around the board.&#10;&#10;Players move their pieces and capture other players the same as in Checkers, moving only towards the opposite side of the board until their pieces can be crowned in their partner's home row, and moving in any direction after.  Only opponent's pieces may be jumped or captured.  Pieces cannot be crowned in opponent's home rows.  Movements are not otherwise restricted on any part of the board.  The team who eliminates their opponents' pieces, or prevents them from moving, wins the game.&#10;&#10;There is one variant provided for in the game's rules, in which players are allowed to jump their partner's pieces without capturing them.&#10;&#10;",

It is a tactical simulation with interesting ideas; units can do Actions by using Action Points, which are gained at the end of each turn and which must be planned carefully by the player. &#10;Combat units are usually at platoon level or single veichle; each unit has a different capacity of fire, depending from the type of fire (Infantry, Tanks or Artillery) and the type of target (Infantry, Tanks and Veichles, Concrete targets). Morale tests and Hit results can apply on Fire, as well as during Mel&egrave;e.&#10;&#10;",

As the leader of a crew, you will increase your reputation and damage your opponent&rsquo;s in three key ways:&#10;1) Controlling the grid by converting it to your crew&rsquo;s color&#10;2) Using remote exploits to damage your opponent&rsquo;s system&#10;3) Hacking into your opponent&rsquo;s mainframe and stealing valuable data&#10;&#10;Objective&#10;There are a limited amount of REP tokens in the general supply.

At the end of the game the player with the greatest net worth in stock value and cash holdings wins.&#10;&#10;This is 18xx on a large scale - 40 railroad companies, two oversize map sheets, 825 tiles, 480 cards (stock shares, trains, private corporations), and a play time to match.&#10;&#10;This game takes the &quot;D&quot; variant of 18C2C: Manifest Destiny and reimplements it on an even larger map (the US, Canada, and Mexico) with a variety of rule changes to provide play variability and balance, most notably player-driven upgrade paths for cities (so that cities will grow to different values in different games) providing new sources of tension in the stock rounds.&#10;&#10;Game features taken from 18C2C: Manifest Destiny include a reservation auction for private companies (similar to 1830), full capitalization, company destinations (somewhat similar to the destinations in 1870: Railroading across the Trans Mississippi from 1870), corporate share redemption, and two types of mergers (voluntary mergers between pairs of companies, and two involuntary mergers of failed railroads into government railroads). High-level &quot;D&quot; trains run short routes (3 to 6 cities) and double the values, simplifying route building and calculation.&#10;&#10;Intended publication is set for 2015 as a full commercial production similar to 18OE, and possibly a conversion kit to include only those components different from 18C2C: Manifest Destiny.&#10;&#10;",

At the beginning of the game you just arrived in the camp. You need to get the power on, radio working, and call for evacuation.&#10;&#10;On each turn you will draw cards from your deck to gain time to take actions like moving, firing, repairing and searching. You can also use the time to refine your tactics by purchasing cards. The cards in your hand  give you both time to take actions and better or more efficient actions.&#10;&#10;As the game progresses your deck will become stronger, but the storm will increase in intensity, the sun will set, and stronger creatures will venture forth from the surrounding Siberian wastes.&#10;&#10;You will need to balance all your actions carefully to survive the elements, repair the prison, kill the winter creatures and finally make a dash for the airstrip when the plane lands!&#10;&#10;",

They face the uncertainty of time travel that bring them to the future year of 2223 where they will join the Spirit and fight a tough battle to stop the power of Evil. In order to accomplish the objective of their mission, the players shall participate in the race of their lives to find 9 secret codes that will stop Evil from wielding its power and destroying Earth.&#10;&#10;Each player is required to put into motion his or her most strategic plan and creative cunningness to plot successfully and beat the other players to be the first to find all the secret codes. The game uses two different decks of power card play / power travel to help the players navigate to their designated mission destination. In this phase, players must cleverly maneuver their moves to put into motion their plans and strategy. The game play takes on an infusion of race and prior planning. High levels of strategy deployment or plotting, combined with tactical maneuvers, is required.&#10;&#10;In the quest to &#239;&#172;&#129;nd the secret codes, the players are required to follow the clues which will lead them to where they are hidden. They then need to decipher the code with the decoder dices. Successful attempts shall be rewarded with energy points and battle &#239;&#172;&#130;ags. They are both critical game changing components that will propel the players to lead in the game.&#10;&#10;The last phase of the race shall see them being pitted in the battle between the Spirit and Evil. Here, the players will be able to deploy actions or movements that will keep them safe. The battle card may also be a game killer if it is played correctly. The players need to be extra cautious at this stage because they may well fall prey to 3 &lsquo;surprise&rsquo; cards in the stack. This can cause them to deplete their Vourton power and lose a turn when they meet face to face with Evil. However, all is not lost. There are saviour cards that will restore the players&rsquo; power immediately without losing a turn.&#10;&#10;",

To get the fish, though, you need to first test your luck with the dice...&#10;&#10;Each turn, the active player rolls three blue dice and two red dice. After the first roll, she can roll each die individually at most one more time. After doing this, she can either fish or poach depending on what she's rolled. If she has at least one hook, one worm and a wave, she can fish by rolling the white die &mdash; and she rolls it a number of times equal to the product of the hooks and waves that she has. The white die features 1-2 fish, a boot (which nets you nothing for that roll), and the sweet ZZZZZZs of someone who fell asleep; catch the Zs and your fishing time ends immediately. If you use one of your two espresso tokens prior to rolling, however, Zs become boots and you can keep rolling.&#10;&#10;When you roll a full house or four- or five-of-a-kind, you can steal 1-3 fish from other players. With a special full house, you can reclaim an espresso chip or move one fish from the lake or another player's pile.&#10;&#10;Once the lake is empty, whoever has the most fish wins. In a tie, the tied player holding the yellow fish wins &mdash; but if neither of them has the yellow fish, then they're out of the game and the player with the nextmost fish wins!&#10;&#10;",

So, while the game uses the RPS mechanism, there are real and interesting decisions to be made which will have the zombies debating their strategy (or at least as well as their limited mental capacity allows).&#10;&#10;If you hate zombies (and you should!), you'll find altogether more zombies than you're comfortable with in I Hate Zombies.&#10;&#10;&quot;I had all the guns, ammo, and canned food I could ever need.

Will your tribe reign supreme in this savage contest for survival?&#10;&#10;Game play alternates between the players. On your turn, you have a choice of three actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Rapine, pillage or plunder (RPP)&#10;    Move&#10;    Discard a card&#10;&#10;&#10;The cards serve the three above purposes. Most of the time, players will move to villages and perform RPP. Sometimes, however, when a barbarian tribe gets a little cocky, a battle will occur between the players. These are settled smoothly using the symbols on the cards in hand, and rest assured--tribute will be paid by the loser!&#10;&#10;I designed Rapine, Pillage &amp; Plunder because I feel there's a dearth of fun, light, yet not-too-simple two-player games. I believe that this game helps fill that void. (Publishers take note). It's a simple game aimed at casual gamers but has enough in the way of tactics and choices to appeal to more seasoned gamers, as well.&#10;&#10;",

Units are brigades formed into three different armies for each player, plus Generals that are needed to activate units. There are also forts and magazines on the map. Tracing of supplies and communication are important to winning the game. The goal is to capture the opponent's main fort. Combat is deterministic, decided by having more units attacking or defending, modified by terrain, forts, or having elite units in the battle.&#10;&#10;",

By drawing a network of roads on their play sheet, players are building a city and trying to score points for their hotels, shops and taxis &mdash; all while avoiding pollution.&#10;&#10;Working out an ideal road network can be quite the puzzle, so before the game begins roads through parks are randomized, making sure that no two games will be alike. Each round, one white die per player, one additional white die, and a blue die are rolled onto the table. The blue die indicates which column the players must use, while each white die indicates a row. In turn each player picks a white die and draws in the given space. In most spaces you draw roads, but in parks you instead build houses. You can draw only once in each space, and if on your turn you cannot draw, you gain pollution.&#10;&#10;A building is scored the moment you draw in its space. For example, when you draw a road through a hotel space, you score points equal to the length of the road passing through that hotel. Shops score according to how many houses are currently connected to the shop. There are also bonuses awarded to the first player who connects a shop to a certain number of houses.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player completes the highest possible hotel or shop score, or when a player loses his last tree due to pollution. Final scores are for connected taxis and for having least/most pollution.&#10;&#10;",

They use a square gridded battlefield, which removes the need to measure both move distances and weapon ranges, thus speeding up the whole process of fighting a wargame. It also removes any doubts or possible disputes as to whether or not a unit has moved too far or if it is in range or not. They also incorporate simple combat resolution systems that likewise speed up game play. The armies needed to fight battles with these rules are small by most wargames standards. This means that players can &lsquo;raise&rsquo; lots of small armies rather than a couple of big ones.&#10;&#10;- Description from Publisher&#10;&#10;",

The game&rsquo;s systems allow each player to control several jets in a fast paced game that can be easily completed in a few hours.&#10;&#10;Modern jet combat, particularly with aircraft such as the F-22, Eurofighter, and SU-35 can be extremely complex with the wide variety of radars, ECM, DDS, weapons, etc., which can bring a game to a crawl when using these planes. Typhoon attempts to incorporate the technology into the various game systems which lets the players fly and fight their jets without having to worry about whether or not you have enough chaff or flares still left in your dispensers to defeat the enemy&rsquo;s next attack.&#10;&#10;This makes Typhoon an ideal way to get new gamers into the modern jet combat era as they can focus on the basics of jet&#10;combat instead of memorizing a two page sequence of play. The game is designed to be used without a hex mat or special stands, so this will let gamers use any miniatures that they have and however they are currently mounted for the game.&#10;&#10;Hopefully, Typhoon will introduce gamers to the exciting world of hitech jet combat and let them use some of the most powerful aircraft in aviation history in a fun and fast moving game.&#10;&#10;",

As such a degree of sportsmanship is necessary between players, it is perfectly acceptable to seek to slaughter the toy soldiers on the table top but in dealings with other players please maintain a degree of sportsmanship. In cases where the interpretation of a rule might be in doubt, for instance whether a unit is in or out of range let the roll of a die or toss of a coin decide.&#10;The rules are divided into four main sections&#10;A brief consideration of those aspects of the Great War which serve to distinguish it from previous and later conflicts.&#10;The main body of the rules.&#10;Generic tables of divisional organisation which may be used to pick forces for a game.&#10;A number of appendices providing extra information and examples.&#10;&#10;",

They are designed to allow players to refight the huge space battles of the Exterminator War.&#10;&#10;There are a couple of other sets of Universe-based rules already in existence.&#10;&#10;    HELLFIRE, which allows players to control a single ship in considerable detail.&#10;    Big Burn is for small fleet actions with a degree of detail as to what damage is done.&#10;&#10;&#10;This set of rules are another step in the abstraction process, designed to make a battle playable in an hour or less, and several battles in a campaign context practical in an evening.&#10;The basic rules concept is a direct steal from the excellent WRG game 'Seastrike' published in, I think 1974.&#10;&#10;Inevitably, that original system has mutated somewhat in its conversion to the Universe, and this system is an attempt to reflect the doctrine and practice of 300+ years of space combat in the Universe.&#10;&#10;Space battles in the Universe generally take place in the orbital space around a colony world. Combat is generally not 'to the death', and fleets will usually withdraw if overmatched.&#10;&#10;Combat is also very greatly influenced by political constraints and the consequent rules of engagement. Similarly, the loss of a capital ship is a major economic loss as it takes a year and a half to build a replacement, and it has significant credit value. (See the Macro Rules for the Humanity Will Prevail Campaign). Captains and admirals are schooled with the prevailing ethos &ndash; which is that if an enemy ship breaks off combat you let it go (after all, it might be you next time).&#10;Much of this was challenged during the Exterminator War &ndash; where the enemy was an implacable machine intelligence &ndash; so when fighting Exterminators the loss of ships is expected. However, that specific threat has now receded.&#10;&#10;",

To achieve this, you need as many votes for yourself as possible, but more importantly, you need to have better relations with other parties than they have with each other.&#10;&#10;Each turn, you play &quot;idea cards&quot; that move the parties' positions on one of the eight political scales (high tax/low tax, immigration/nationalism etc). Parties who move in concert may strengthen their relation; parties who don't risk weakening theirs. Every move gives the parties more or less favor with the eight voter groups (old/young, men/women etc), which determines the votes cast by the game's sixteen voters (representing every combination of the four voter groups).&#10;&#10;The game is an act of balances: Stick out your neck enough to keep a clear profile and win voters that give you political weight, but co-operate enough to place this weight in the right position of the winning coalition.&#10;&#10;",

The number of living cards drawn is based on the number of players who started the game.

Attack and defense characteristics are compared to one another to see who wins the fight!  After all fighting actions are resolved, the game turn starts over again.&#10;&#10;There are several ways to win: in player versus player mode, you want to be the zombie who has taken the least amount of damage.  In our co-op mode, you must successfully complete the choosen scenario before running out of hit points.&#10;&#10;Our scenarios range from eliminating the entire town of Risington, to picking off specific members of the town!&#10;&#10;",

It requires a six to move a counter out of jail.If a player's counter finishes on an opponent's counter then the opponents counter is returned to its jail. Once a player has got all of one colour home, he then requires a six and thereafter may move his other colour or partners colour on his colour's turn turn.&#10; If two or more counters of the same colour land on the same square they form a stack. No opponent's counter may pass a stack. To break a stack a player must first land on the square immediately before that stack. He must then throw successive sixes equal to the number of stack counters plus one. If successful the stack counters are returned to their jail, otherwise the turn ends.&#10; If a multicoloured stack is formed, this does not block movement, it may not attempt to break a stack and if landed on  its counters are returned to their jails.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The Red Death is running rampant throughout the country, claiming countless lives. In an attempt to avoid this plague, Prince Prospero and a thousand of his closest friends have shut themselves inside the seven rooms of his castellated abbey. One night, the prince decides to throw a masquerade ball to keep his friends entertained. But while this ball is in full swing, a masked figure, of who had not been seen before, has started to make its way throughout the rooms of the abbey. Angered by this figure&rsquo;s mask of a plague ridden corpse, the prince tried to kill the figure but was killed in the process. Now the prince&rsquo;s nobles are hunting for the masked figure that at some point covered its mask with another. Now nobody knows who is who in this game of bluffing, deduction, and hand management.&#10;&#10;In this game for 2 to 6 players, the game begins with the abbey of seven rooms being built and each player receiving one role card. The roles are kept hidden as they will be revealed during game play. Each player then selects one of the seven rooms where they will start the game. On each player's turn they will have a variety of actions that will allow them to trap, kill, or reveal other players, move throughout the abbey, or use a key to unlock a trap. They can perform these actions by using the cards that they draw. The goal of the game is to be the first collect five victory points and can do so by being a Noble alive at the end of the round or by not being trapped at the end of the round if playing as The Red Death.&#10;&#10;Awards&#10;2014 MicroGame Contest Best Theme&#10;2014 MicroGame Contest People's Choice - 4th Place&#10;&#10;",

Because each player represents two colors of pieces, his or her score is mostly the sum of points scored by those two colors.

The ultimate goal was to handle the battle of fleets but still make the individual ship and how it was maneuvered matter. Some compromises were made, other things were simplified, and few items simply tossed out. The desire was to have a game that would entice new players to starship combat gaming and give an option for battles with larger numbers of ships to those who have fleets at the ready.&#10;&#10;",

They are best for the Punic, Successor and Roman Civil Wars where the quinquireme (five) was the most common 'line of battle' ship. Fleet of Battle is intended for use with fleets of between six and 20 ships per player with an optimum of a dozen or so for an evening&rsquo;s play. Larger battles can be fought without difficulty, but more than an evening should be set aside for such games.&#10;&#10;There is no set ground scale or ship scale. The rules were devised for what felt right using 1:600 model ships. Fleets in classical times were very large, often several hundred ships strong, manned by tens of thousands.With this in mind it is suggested that historical scenarios should be fought using a ratio of one model to 10 - 20 ships.&#10;&#10;If using 1:1200 scale models or smaller, use centimetres instead of inches.&#10;&#10;",

When the story is over, each player attempts to deduce and guess the mood of the protagonist player: Secretly, players choose a specific mood on their mood wheels, then everybody reveals their choice. Points are scored depending on how close your choice is to the protagonist's chosen mood. The protagonist-player scores victory points depending on how close the other players get to his chosen mood.&#10;&#10;When everybody has scored points, the role of the protagonist passes clockwise, and a new turn starts.

In others, the Renaissance produces a plutocracy, which leads to a utopia &mdash; or perhaps to anarchy; it's all in the subtle details. As a time-traveler, you've seen it all, and it all has its place. What's important is who's in control in the long run when time travel is invented. With other time-travelers mucking with things for their own reasons, your course is clear: you will tamper with history as much as is needed, stepping on however many butterflies it takes, to get a perfect world under your own benign rule.&#10;&#10;In Temporum, the board shows the possible paths history can take and the actual path it currently takes. On your turn, you can change history, travel through time, and visit a point in history. You draw cards, play some of them for money and abilities, and score some of them to advance your power through history. Having more power in a time period gives you abilities, but your goal is to have all of your power in the last time period, the time from which you come.&#10;&#10;",

When you arrive at the lantern with the ring, press on the lantern to see the result. An unlit ring means you have to go back on the track. A lit ring means... you've won! Light up the ring and recite the Green Lantern oath!&#10;&#10;Players roll a pip die to move around a circular board. Only after collecting all four types of Green Lantern Constructs will a player leave the main board and have an opportunity to win the game. Varying spaces along the way distribute Constructs or force players to discard Constructs, while other spaces allow a player to send themselves or other players to a space of his or her choosing.&#10;&#10;Two notable components also affect game play. By landing on a ring space, a player might take the Lantern's ring (an actual light up ring component), allowing him or her to roll the pip die twice and pick from the outcomes. Finally, even after collecting all four Constructs, a player must successfully charge their ring to win. A large Lantern battery piece gives a player a roughly 2/3 chance of victory by spinning a plastic piece, pressing a button, and awaiting the random response.&#10;&#10;",

This 'secession' was the result of years of rivalry between north and south and friction between the federal Government and State governments, particularly over the issue of slavery. Some 50,000 books and articles have been written about this epic conflict that re-forged the American nation.&#10;This is a rules system that enables players to re-fight some of the 2,500 battles and skirmishes that made up of this dramatic episode of history.

The game commences with the opposing forces (starting on or off table) and advancing towards each other, with intent to give battle and destroy the opposing force. Starting with initial contacts from patrols and/or vanguards prompting their commanders to respond. The main forces are deployed in attempts to seize and/or maintain the initiative. Finally one force is defeated and the victors may attempt pursuit. The rules are primarily designed around this type of game.&#10;b) Scenario &ndash; each player has a force defined for the scenario which may be based on fictional or historical events. The objectives and victory conditions being defined by the scenario.&#10;&#10;REPRESENTATIVE SCALES&#10;There are variable ground and troop scales to allow for varying sizes of engagements. So in effect the ground scale will vary from 1:2500 (i.e. 1mm on the table = 2.5m in life) to 1:30,000 (1mm = 30m). However in any game the ground and troop scales are directly proportionate to each other.&#10;&#10;The game is broken into bounds of varying length. For game purposes these are expressed are periods of minutes. The activity of all troops within any bound is directly related to the time span of the bound. For example a five minute bound allows all troops to complete five minutes of activities. However a 500 minute bound allows all troops five hundred minutes of activities. The reason for the variability is to allow for those periods where little or no activity occurs to be passed over.&#10;&#10;Troops are represented by figurines and or models based on varying size bases.&#10;&#10;",

For&#10;the purpose of this game, scales are divided into two classes; 1/700th and smaller (sub-1/700th). The most popular small scale is 1/3000th. At the end of the rules there is a special section for players (including myself) who prefer the 1/700th - the real scale.&#10;&#10;",

As a part of this maiden voyage, the corporation has agreed to let you reinvest any wealth you uncover back into training your Pod pilots, increasing their skills and efficiencies. Will you be remembered as the greatest Solarus Corporation employee in the galaxy?&#10;&#10;Super Motherload is a tile-laying deck-building game, which means that you have your own deck of cards from which you draw each turn. The cards in your deck start out very basic, but over the course of the game you add new and more powerful cards to it. You use these cards to bomb and drill minerals and other bonuses from the game board. You then use the minerals you've collected as money to purchase better cards for your deck. Some cards give you an immediate bonus when you purchase them, and some give you other bonuses when you use them to drill. Each card you purchase from your library is worth victory points (VPs). You can also gain VPs from achievement cards that become available throughout the game. Whoever has the most VPs at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Super Motherload features game boards that are added and removed during play to create videogame-like scrolling action, and it challenges spatial relation skills for 2-4 players who love video games, Eurostyle board games, or deck-building card games.&#10;&#10;",

Take control of a stuffed animal animated by the Child&rsquo;s imagination and given strength by the magic of dreams themselves!&#10;&#10;Rounds are divided into phases, with the players and the Nightmare deck each taking turns to act.  First, the stuffed animals raid the Toy Chest for Weapon and Skill cards that they can use to defend against the enemies of the Nightmare.  Then, each player is dealt two Nightmare cards, which could either be enemies or Crises, that their stuffed animal must deal with during the next phase.  Finally, the dreamscape shifts, and a new Dream card is flipped, adding a new weakness for the Nightmare to exploit.&#10;&#10;After each side has prepared, the enemies and stuffed animals take turns attacking.  Once every enemy has attacked, each side is granted a short reprieve before starting a new round.&#10;&#10;Every round is more dire than the last, but if at least one stuffed animal survives until the end of the third round, the Nightlight has survived until dawn and the players have won the game!&#10;&#10;Fight hard, but don&rsquo;t let the changing nature of dreams distract your stuffed animal and give the Nightmare an opportunity to strike!&#10;&#10;",

Only you, a lone revenant hunter, can protect the town and slay they who walk again.&#10;&#10;Armed with limited supply of holy water and iron spikes you enter the town square and prepare for the coming onslaught.&#10;&#10;The Draugr is a solitaire game playing in about 20 minutes.&#10;&#10;To Win:&#10;You must slay 4 of the 6 Draugr.&#10;&#10;To Lose:&#10;If at anytime during Phase 1 all 7 Townspeople, or more than 7 of the cards (a combination of Townspeople and Locations) are corrupted you lose.&#10;&#10;Playing the Game: &#10;The game is played in rounds consisting of two phases: Corruption and Hunt.&#10;&#10;Phase 1 - Corruption&#10;Roll the six-sided die once to see which Draugr will hold sway over Stj&oslash;rdal for the round and will corrupt Locations and Townspeople in the row they are adjacent to, matching the die face to the image on a Draugr Card.&#10;&#10;Roll the die a second time and look at the symbol in the upper left corner of the die. Place a Corruption Marker on each card in that Draugr&rsquo;s row with the matching Corruption Sigil. (See the section on the Shepherdess for protection from this rule.)&#10;&#10;If a Townsperson card has been turned over you do not need to place additional Corruption Markers on the card.&#10;&#10;Phase 2 - The Hunt&#10;You must now move your player marker up to two adjacent cards in distance (The Nunnery and Foundry are the only two cards to supersede this rule). All movement is orthogonal (horizontally and vertically).&#10;&#10;Once you have finished moving you may choose a Special Action of that Townsperson or Location. Some cards have only 1 Special Action, some allow for a choice between 2 Special Actions. You do not have to choose a Special Action if you do not wish to.&#10;&#10;If you land on a Townsperson card that has been turned over, no Special Action can be chosen.&#10;&#10;If a Special Action allows you to place Holy Water or Iron Markers on a Draugr, take one from your supply on the Town Square card and place it on a Draugr of your choice. If you match the number of markers as indicated in the upper left of the Draugr card, that Draugr is slain and removed from the game. Return all Holy Water and Iron Markers on that Draugr to your supply.&#10;&#10;Once a Draugr is slain and their card removed, slide one of the adjacent Draugr cards up or down so that is partially spans either 2 rows (or if 2 Draugr have been slain, 3 rows). The Draugr now holds sway over 10 (or 15) cards for rolls during the Corruption Phase. If you slay all 3 Draugr on one side, no further Draugr are moved to replace those slain.&#10;&#10;Game End:&#10;If you are able to slay 4 of the 6 Draugr you are successful and the other Draugr are forced to flee. If at anytime during Phase 1 all the Townspeople, or more than 7 of the cards (a combination of Townspeople and Locations) are corrupted you lose.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "A light strategy game for two players, from the setting of the Mouse Guard comics and roleplaying game.&#10;&#10;Each player controls four mouse pawns (white or black) on a 6-by-8 grid. Play involves a deck containing 10 of 3 types of cards (30 in total): Sword, Stronghold, and Diplomacy.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Setup&#10;&#10;Turn the board so that each player has 6 squares in front of them. One player takes one mouse of each color, hides one in each palm, and has the other player pick a hand, thereby selecting what color they will be. Each player then places their mice in any configuration on the two closest grid intersection ranks. Shuffle the card deck and deal 3 cards to each player. Black goes first.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Play&#10;&#10;On your turn, select one mouse and move it into any open space around it (up, down, left, or right). You may then play one of your cards targeting that mouse.&#10;&#10;Sword: Move in an L shape (move one space in any direction, then one perpendicular to your last move). Any mice encountered are pushed in the direction of your movement. If multiple mice are lined up, all are pushed. Mice pushed off the board or into one of the corners surrounding a Stronghold are captured and removed from play. You may not capture your own mice.&#10;&#10;Stronghold: Leap off the grid onto an adjacent square. Mice may not enter grid corners touching your square. Mice currently in such a grid corner are pushed back one space. Mice will try to move in the direction of their side of the board first. If they cannot move into an open space, the Stronghold cannot be played.&#10;&#10;    If you are in a stronghold, you may leave this position by moving to any of the grid corners touching the square and then moving once space. In this special movement case, you may not play a card.&#10;&#10;&#10;Diplomacy: Choose the nearest enemy mouse (a non-Stronghold mouse counts as occupying the 4 squares around it): &#10;&#10;    If they are in a stronghold, force them out and into an adjacent grid corner of your choice.&#10;    If not, switch places with that mouse.&#10;&#10;&#10;Rescue: If you have one of each card, play all of them and put one of your captured mice back on the board in any open setup position.&#10;&#10;Immediately after resolving a turn, draw cards until your hands size is 3. If there are not enough cards, draw what remains, shuffle the discard pile, and continue drawing.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Winning&#10;&#10;Build a stronghold in one of the enemy corners or capture all enemy mice.&#10;&#10;",
