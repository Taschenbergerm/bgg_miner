        "description": "Award winning game author Martyn F takes you back to the start of civilization. You take on the role of a clan leader and explore the landscape, discover new tools and offer to holy places. All this to gather as much status as possible.&#10;&#10;Epoch: Early Inventors is very thematic and tries to stay as close to reality as possible.&#10;&#10;Before starting the game you build a landscape of hexagonal playing cards and holy places.&#10;&#10;In your turn you can carry out 1 action and/or develop 1 card and/or offer to 1 holy place.&#10;&#10;You can choose between the following actions: gather food, fish (for food), hunt for deer, butcher deer, explore adjacent cards or work to get raw material.&#10;&#10;You need food to move around the game board and develop cards. Gathering food and fishing are basically the same actions, but depending on the tools you have, the one action might give you more food than the other.&#10;&#10;You need raw materials to develop cards and offer to the holy places. Sometimes raw materials can help you to heighten the proceeds of actions. The action &quot;Work&quot; can get you raw materials. The type of landscape you are currently standing on determines how much work it is to get hold of a certain raw material. Raw materials used in the game are: wood, flax, stone, flint, clay and iron ore.&#10;&#10;Butchering animals can not only get you food, but also skins, bones and tendons.&#10;&#10;Exploring cards adds to your status. It also opens up more cards to be developed.&#10;&#10;To develop a card, you need to &quot;pay&quot; the food and materials depicted on the card.&#10;&#10;Once you have developed a card, you can use the tool, equipment or knowledge of this card to your advantage. E.g. Rope Making allows you to turn 2 flax into 3 ropes. Sowing gives you 2-4 extra food, when gathering food. An axe makes it easier to chop wood.&#10;&#10;By cleverly using your own cards and those of your opponents, you try to offer materials to as many holy places as you can, thereby increasing your status even more.&#10;&#10;After 14-20 rounds the game is over. The player that has collected the most status has won.&#10;&#10;",

Along the way, we have, among others, views of Pittsburgh, Omaha, &quot;surprise by savage Indians&quot;, &quot;wild heard of buffalloes&quot;, &quot;railroad bridge over the Platte river,&quot; Cheyenne, Green River, Humboldt Valley, &quot;Trukee&quot; Valley, Sierra Nevada and Sacramento. The text is titled &quot;Trip from New-York to San Francisco by the Union Pacific Rail Road. A new illustrated Travel-game with 45 stations, 1 dy, 12 cars and 12 numbers charts&quot;. The text is written in German and English and explains the game and the views. The cover of the game box (19x24) has a lovely colored litho view of two women joining hands across the American Continent, one representing America and the other Asia.&#10;&#10;(Trivia: It is very likely that this game was also sold by the on-train concessionaire (&quot;news butchers&quot;) on the trans-continental trains of the Union Pacific, just as promotional picture booklets were sold showing the scenic views along the route -- in other words, a tourist's memento).&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "A simple TCG game with an interesting mechanic about the disposition of card in a 3x3 grid (resembling Tic-Tac-Toe)&#10;&#10;There are 4 types of cards: attack (red sword icon), defend (blue shield icon), revitalization (green cross icon) and neutral (yellow circle icon). Also, the cards may have arrows in one or more 8-way directions (up, diagonal up-right, right, diagonal down-right...) Each player starts with a 3x3 grid, 10 points of life and a deck of 25-40 cards. With the flip of a coin is decided the order of playing, at the first turn you must draw 5 cards and play 1 card, for the rest of the match you must have 5 cards in your hand (except when you have 0 cards on your deck)&#10;&#10;The purpouse of the game is to combine at least 2 cards to produce a combination of at least 3 symbols. To combine the cards you must put them in the 3x3 grids and achieve to match the arrows (for example, a card in the second row and second column with an up arrow matches with a card with a down arrow that is in the first row and second column). The effect is determined by the greatest symbol value (except neutral, that haves no effect), in case of draw (for example, 2 sword and 2 crosses) the player chooses what effect it should be. Attack effect (sword) deducts 1 point of defence from the life of the opponent for each sword in the combination OR you can disable a card in the rival's 3x3 grid. Defence adds to the player 1 point of life for each shield in the combination. Revitalization can undisable 1 card in your grid.&#10;&#10;There are 2 ways to win the game: by reducing the rival's life to 0 OR when the rival have cards in the hand and cannot play a card (the grid is filled with 9 cards that cannot combine in this turn) It should be noted that when a player haves 0 cards in its deck, losses 1 point of life at the start of his turn.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Assassins of Vance is a game for 2-4 players in which you maneuver to become the leader of the Assassins Guild in Vance, city of splendor. It is the first board game designed by Vic Davis, owner and operator of Cryptic Comet Games. Vic's previous games have been computer turn based strategy games and have won praise from critics and fans alike for their stimulating board game like mechanics.&#10;&#10;Players first select a player card that represents their Assassin each possessing a unique one time use special ability and then assign dice from a pool to 4 attributes: Combat, Stealth, Traps and Lore. The assignments indicate how many dice are rolled for each corresponding challenge type and what face results constitute success when the dice are rolled.&#10;&#10;Play then proceeds in rounds where each player takes his turn. 2 and 4 player games last 8 rounds while 3 player games last 9 rounds.&#10;&#10;During their turn players can choose 2 of 8 possible actions (some actions can only be chosen once)&#10;&#10;1. Visit the Guild Healer (pay gold to remove wound tokens)&#10;2. Draw Guild Stipend (gold) (only once per turn)&#10;3. Buy an Item Card&#10;4. Buy a Spell Card (if you have a skill card that allows this)&#10;5. Visit the Guild Sorcerer (pay gold to charge a spell)&#10;6. Draw 2 Secret Objective Cards (keep 1 or none)(only once per turn)&#10;7. Play a Guild Card for its Guild Event text&#10;8. Attempt a Mission Contract Card (only once per turn)&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to accumulate Influence Points (IP). Influence Points can be gained by either successfully completing Mission Contract cards or buying influence cards at the end of the round during the Influence Bidding Phase where cards are auctioned off to the highest bidder.  Each influence card has an IP value and a unique passive special ability that can help the player out during the game.&#10;&#10;Mission Contract cards are at the heart of the game and represent assassination targets that the guild has available for its guild members. Players can play Guild Cards face down before the round begins to the revealed Mission Contract cards on the table in order to help their own or hurt their opponents' chances of accomplishing the mission. Missions vary from level 1 to 5 and offer an array of rewards from Influence Points to gold and additional ability die. However, the greater the rewards, the higher the risk that your assassin will be wounded or fail the mission. Take too many wound tokens and you are out of the game.&#10;&#10;Each mission is composed of a chain of challenges corresponding to the 4 ability types on the player cards i.e. combat, stealth, etc.. Players determine the level of the challenge (number of successes needed) from the contract card and then select a challenge card from the top 3 revealed cards of the Challenge Deck.  The challenge card indicates the type of challenge and the pass/fail rules.  Players roll the appropriate number of dice, use Guild Cards, Item Cards, Skill Cards, Spell Cards and fate tokens (rerolls) to modify the results and hopefully win the challenge. Players can press their luck along the challenge track to earn better rewards but must be careful as a red skull challenge that is failed means that the mission is failed and all rewards are lost. Sometimes things just don't go well from the start and the player may elect to abort the mission.&#10;&#10;Players also have the opportunity to use Guild Card Interrupts to take actions during their opponents turns to disrupt their carefully laid assassination plans.&#10;&#10;When the last round finishes players add up their IP from their completed Mission Contract cards, Influence Cards and completed Secret Objective cards(uncompleted cards penalize the player). The player with the most IP wins and becomes the Master of The Assassins Guild in Vance.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "A merciless war is raging throughout feudal Japan, fueled by the hunger for power or the desire for peace of its great lords. As one of them, you must defend your territory from the enemy threatening your borders. Now it's time to command your troops and read through your opponent's strategy to take over the battlefield and prevail!&#10;&#10;Kenjin is a quick and subtle card game of bluffing and tactics. You share two random battlefields with each of the players next to you: one worth 4 points, the other 6.&#10;&#10;You get a hand of thirteen cards numbered from 0 to 3. They are your peasants, thugs, lords. On your turn, send two of them to one or two of your battlefields. When all the cards have been played, each battlefield is won by the player with the highest sum of card values there. Some cards are always played face up, others always face down. Some of them also have a special power: Use your peasants (0) to lure your opponent's troops to a battlefield, or to score more points if they survive. Play a Lord (2) early as it's strengthened by each new reinforcement thereafter.&#10;&#10;Terrains also impact a battle's outcome: Peasants take arms to protect their rice fields, while military strength is not always enough when you fight over a palace. Once each battlefield has been scored, the player with the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;",

One player reads out the question and then places it face up for everyone to solve.  Once a player solves the problem, he/she checks the answer on the back of the card.

        "description": "Battle Roll is a 2 player dueling dice game! It's quick, addictive, portable, and loads of fun! It comes with eight beautiful precision engraved and painted dice with incredible detail. It only takes about 5-10 minutes to play, making this a great game to pull out in an airport, waiting room, or anywhere else! Because of the short game length it's also great for using in a tournament scenario with groups of people. Don't let the game length and portability fool you into thinking that there isn't a lot of depth or variety in playing Battle Roll. The outcomes are nearly endless! A game could range from a complete blow-out, to a neck-and-neck down to the last roll, sudden death victory! It all depends on how the dice fall! Battle Roll is really fun to play, but it also looks cool! The combination of  custom polyhedral dice and acrylic life-stones are sure to attract attention and questions like &quot;What are you playing?&quot; It all fits nicely into a custom zippered pouch making it easy for Battle Rollers on the go to sneak in a quick game wherever they are.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In Death Over the Kingdom you have two games in one:&#10;- For groups of 3 to 7 players;&#10;- For groups of 3 to 16 players, although we recommend starting with&#10;8 players.&#10;&#10;The rules explained below are for a game of 3 to 7 players.&#10;&#10;The game consists of as many turns as the number of players. Each turn has 3&#10;Rounds where victory condition varies.&#10;&#10;- Round 1: The highest card wins.&#10;- Round 2: The lowest card wins.&#10;- Round 3: The intermediate cards win.&#10;&#10;Each Round can be won by more than one player, if they match the score or&#10;victory condition. For example, in a 5-player game, up to 3 of them could have&#10;the intermediate card that gives the victory in Round 3.&#10;&#10;When all 3 Rounds have been played, the starting player becomes Dealer.&#10;Thereby, all players will be Dealer once throughout the game.&#10;In each Round -in order, beginning with the starting player- players secretly&#10;choose a card from their hand and place it in their playing area face down&#10;They must choose between:&#10;- Exchange your card with the player on the left (they cannot refuse). The&#10;Dealer player has no players on their left. If you&rsquo;re Dealer and want to&#10;exchange your card, you can do it with the deck, first declaring it aloud. To&#10;do this, you must lift one or more cards at a time without looking. The card&#10;revealed after this cut is your new card.&#10;- To fold, that is, to keep the card that you&rsquo;ve chosen or that&rsquo;s been given to&#10;you after a previous exchange.&#10;- Use the ability of the card, if possible (Merchant, Thief, Juggler and Dragon).&#10;- If you have cards in hand, change the card with one of your hand.&#10;Once all the players have played, reveal players&acute;cards to activate the abilities&#10;&ldquo;At the end of the Round...&rdquo; of the cards that have this ability (Innkeeper,&#10;Jester, Monk, Sorceress, Knight, Princess and Queen).&#10;&#10;The winners of each Round score a point. To indicate that they take the score&#10;markers and place them in their playing area according to their points value.&#10;Once the 3 Rounds have been played, the deck is formed and shuffled again,&#10;and a new turn begins.&#10;When the last Dealer player&rsquo;s turn is finished, the points are counted. The&#10;SECOND player with the most victory points is declared an absolute winner&#10;of Death Over The Kingdom until the next game!&#10;In case all players are tied in highest and lowest points, no player wins this&#10;game. You will have to play again!&#10;&#10;",

Founded in the times of Caesar Augustus and built up by generations of Roman architects, this was the Emperor's residence and a world city during this period. The remains of these most impressive structures can still be visited today. Foremost of these great achievements in the city is the massive &quot;Porta Nigra&quot;, a large Roman city gate located in Trier, Germany that dates to the 2nd century.&#10;&#10;The game Porta Nigra (which translates as &quot;black gate&quot;) is set in that place and time with the players taking on the roles of Roman architects working on the city gate of Porta Nigra. Each player commands a master builder, who moves around a circular track on the game board, enabling you to buy or build only where this master builder is located. Moving the master builder to farther locations along the track is expensive, so players must plan their movements and builds carefully. The number and type of actions that may be performed on your turn comes from cards in your personal draw deck.&#10;&#10;Buildings are erected physically at the various locations around the city using 3D building pieces.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In Mombasa, players acquire shares of chartered companies based in Mombasa, Cape Town, Saint-Louis, and Cairo and spread their trading posts throughout the African continent in order to earn the most money.&#10;&#10;&quot;As I expected, the East African Company's network of trading posts has spread far into the West. They were even able to expand into a couple of diamond mines. It seems reasonable to invest our recent yield here in Mombasa, rather than to continue our unrivalled commitment in Cape Town. After all, it can only be to our advantage to have other irons in the fire. And when the day of reckoning comes, it will show whether our hoarding of holdings and our intransigent eagerness are worth it...&quot;&#10;&#10;Mombasa is a tense Euro-style strategy game set in 18th century Africa in which players invest in four chartered companies. Using influence to help them expand across the continent improves the value of the players' shares in these companies. Players will also trade in bananas, coffee or cotton, work together with diamond merchants and ensure that the accounts are kept up to date. To make the most of this one will need to have the correct action cards (back) in hand at the same time, which needs excellent forward planning.&#10;&#10;Mombasa features a unique, rotating-display hand-mechanism that drives game play: Players start with an identical hand, but acquire new and more powerful cards from the rotating display throughout the game. Each round players choose action cards from their hand, place them face down in the so-called action slot (beneath the player board), and then reveal them simultaneously to carry out the actions. At the end of the action phase, each card is moved to the so-called resting slot (above the player board). Cards in the resting slots are inactive and cannot be used until they are recovered - each round one can only return cards of one resting slot which is why it can make quite a difference in which action slots certain cards are placed.&#10;&#10;The game ends after seven rounds, players add up their scores in different categories, and the player with the highest score (who has earned the most money) wins the game. With a variety of paths to victory and double-sided company boards, each game will be a new and different challenge.&#10;&#10;",

Be the first player to dispose of all your mice to win!&#10;&#10;In the co-operative game, players pick 15-24 mice dice (depends on the age of the players) and try to place all of the mice on top of the structure while the elephants try to interfere.

As a buyer's agent, you are trying to find popular items, buy them cheap, and sell them for a profit!&#10;&#10;If you are the first player to earn $45 in Flea Market, you win!&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;Players start with some money and 2d6. The goods tokens are numbered 3-18 and placed on the board. Each turn, the current player rolls 3d6 and that item goes up for auction. If it's another player's item, that player becomes the Auctioneer. Bidders (non-Auctioneers) all roll 2d6 secretly, and are allowed one reroll. Then reveal your dice: from high to low, players get the option to buy the item for the sum of their dice, paying the Auctioneer. If the token belonged to a player, that player also gets a bonus $3-7 (depending on how far in the game you are). If no one buys it, the current player gets it for free (if it's another player's item, they keep it)! The game ends as soon as someone gets $45 = winner!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Visual creativity game where players interpret inkblots to tell stories.  Has many models of play a few of which we review here.  More on our website.&#10;&#10;Story Play: The Simplest RoarStack game, for casual group play or children,  is Story Play wherein you relate your card to the previously played card, possibly within the optional theme of the round.  In Story Play, the added sayings and card value/suits don't matter, just the inkblots and the story. This is a good mode for young children and people more interested in collaboration and storytelling than the competition.&#10;&#10;Point Play: If you want to keep score and compete with others, then you can add the dimension of point play where victory points are scored based on phrase+value on the story cards when the conversation of the group matches the phrase. You play your victory cards at any time. Victory points can come from mundane things in the conversation from the weather, to social relations, to pop culture. Your inkblots and storytelling can help lead the conversation, but you don't score victory points from what you do/say, only from what your friends do/say.  This mode encourages talking with and listening to your friends and is great for party play. Even when it is not your turn to play a card, you need to pay attention and engage in dialog, maybe even trying to guide the conversation so you can score points. However, you also have to be active in the round to score so you have to keep that story going when it is your turn.  Victory scoring is generally simple -- you play the victory card in front of you so just count them at the end of the round.&#10;&#10;Gestour/Best play: A mode good for larger groups or big/noisy parties is Gestour/Best mode where everyone competes to try to extend the same story. A gestour is a teller of legendary tales. In this mode, the gestour starts a story and everyone picks a card from their had and tries to be the best extension of that story based on the inkblot on their card. After the cards to play are exposed, the gestour defines how they will define &quot;best&quot;. There is an optional 30 second free-for-all period where everyone tries to convince others that theirs is the best extension. The gestour then begins calling on players who have 10 seconds to tell their card's story. The gestour picks the &quot;best&quot; answer and that person becomes the new gestour. Everyone else draws a replacement card. The first person out of cards wins the hand.&#10;&#10;Twisted Play: Another mode of play is Twisted play, which is good for people who play traditional card games. In Twisted play, you use just the playing card deck, and play your favorite classic card game, with a twist -- you can use the inkblots to connect cards or as wild cards. For example, in Roaring Rummy you might connect a random card into a part of a straight by telling the inkblots' secret stories and connecting misfit cards to those before and after it in sequence. In Roaring Go Fish, when you pull a card from the pool you can also match it if you can tell the story to connect it to your matching card.  In Solitary Stories you can play any card anywhere, but only if you can tell its story. Here, the role of the stories is to directly help you score points in a classic game. These add RoarStack Story play to existing games, making almost any card wild by using your creativity. It adds a new twist and often a lot more laughter, to well-known games.&#10;&#10;Ideation Play: Another mode of play is ideation -- the generation of ideas related to solving a problem.  Here, the player(s) takes a problem to be solved and uses the cards to help explore the problem, the constraints, and potential solutions. RoarStack is not only a fun game; it can also be an innovation tool for improving creativity and problem-solving. Creativity in innovation and problem-solving is often about linking disparate ideas together. Given a topic, people see different things in the cards, and seeing things in the cards makes connections to other ideas. In the words of the very innovative Steve Jobs: &quot;Creativity is just connecting things.&quot;  Dr. Boult, one of the creators, has use it in multiple corporate innovation tranining sessions and in the classroom with significant results.&#10;&#10;Kickstarter edition sold out. Second edition printed in 2017 with new custom case and printed instructions.   THe second edition also modified some of the &quot;point&quot; questions based on user feedback from the first edition.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In Director's Cut: The Card Game, players are Hollywood movie producers in the early 20th century. Each player will try to put together the best movie-making teams in order to maximise the profit from each movie they make.&#10;&#10;As movie producers, players will hire cast and crew from a central shared market, while trying to deny their opponent access to key cast and crew members. Once a player has assembled a set of cast and crew cards, they will play these cards to produce a movie from a shared set of screenplays. Each screenplay has its own set of cast requirements and awards cash and other bonuses, based on the quality of the production. The richest player at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;Director's Cut: The Card Game is a game about set collection and resource management. It's suitable for 2 players and takes around 15 minutes to play.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In the fall of 1861, General McClellan ordered his subordinate, Charles Pomeroy Stone, to make a demonstration on the West bank of the Potomac 35 miles from Washington DC to see if the Confederates might react. A patrol had mistakenly reported a rebel camp ripe for raiding so Stone, in turn, ordered Colonel Deven to advance on the supposed camp. Having done so, Deven found nothing of the kind. Confused, he settled his men in a defensive position and awaited new orders. Stone decided to send the remainder of the 15th Massachusetts, With Colonel Edward Baker in command, across the river so that he might conduct a reconnaissance in force around Leesburg, VA. A sharp engagement ensued with Baker calling for more reinforcements. The army strength on both sides grew to approximately 1700 men.&#10;&#10;Colonel Baker was killed late in the afternoon during a failed attack on the rebel line. Before long, disorganized federal troops were recrossing the river. By early evening The 18th Mississippi arrived and aided in an assault that fully routed the boys in blue. Their artillery abandoned, many Union soldiers were forced down the steep slope called Ball's Bluff and into the river. Soldiers swarmed the waiting boats. Overcrowded, several boats capsized on their way back to Harrison Island. An untold number of Federals drowned in their desperate attempt to escape. By day&rsquo;s end, 223 Union men were killed, 226 were wounded, and 553 were trapped and captured by the advancing rebels. In all, the rebels lost 36 KIA, 264 WIA, and 3 captured for a total of 303 &ndash; killed, wounded and captured.&#10;&#10;Ball's Bluff is a hex-based, chit-pull system game using company sized units. It features low complexity rules and low counter density - 103 pieces. The map has been drawn by famed Civil War map creator, Rick Barber and covers the area immediately surrounding Ball's Bluff. The action represented covers only the heavy fighting which took place from the early afternoon on. Playtime, once the rules are understood will average two hours or less.&#10;&#10;",

You are all Knights in service of King Elvish. And like all Knights of the Kingdom you are madly in love with King Elvish&rsquo;s daughter. After much discussion, King Elvish and his daughter have agreed that the most valiant of her chosen suitors will become heir to the throne. The first Knight to present the Princess with the 3 Gifts of Gallantry she desires will win her favour. To acquire these gifts you must complete quests and obtain Laurels of Valor. Many Quests are impossible to complete alone. So, to demonstrate you are a born leader, you must hire and lead an adventuring party chosen from the most Motley Crew of the Kingdom. But, as a Knight of the Kingdom, you have worked your whole life in service and in turn been supported by the King. You have no gold to spare. In order to secure the necessary gold to pay your crew you must moonlight on OPQ (Other Patron&rsquo;s Quests). Use your gold and crew wisely to quickly complete as many quests as possible. Thereby securing your place as the true Rock Star Knight of the Kingdom and rightful heir to the throne.&#10;&#10;In Hard Day&rsquo;s Knight each player holds 3 action dice, 1 patron die, some gold coins, and a hand of Motley Crew cards. Each round begins with the available Quests of the day posted at the center of the table. A round is a single hard day in a Knight&rsquo;s life attempting to complete as many Quests as possible. All players simultaneously roll their 4 dice at once. The patron die randomly determines the turn order for each round. To complete a Quest and receive the Laurels and daily income from that Quest card, players must match their action dice with the dice icons on the Quest cards. But don&rsquo;t be so quick to grab those Quest cards. Each player has a chance to hire Motley crew members and disrupt the dice on the table, or possibly the turn order, as you fight it out to be the first to complete the available Quests of the day.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Like its predecessor, [d0x3d!] v2 has players working together as a skilled team of hackers, pulling off a digital heist on a secured network to find and reassemble the pieces of their digital assets and escape before being detected by the network's administrators.&#10;&#10;Players work against time, changing network topology, and increasingly aggressive sysadmins to score their objectives and get out before they're caught, or enough of the network is taken out of service to make reassembly or escape impossible.&#10;&#10;The v2 version of [d0x3d!] changes the modular board - instead of square, adjacent tiles with unrestricted movement, the network is now made up of (24) hex tiles with asymmetric pathing to challenge the players by forcing them to forge a path through the system, and adds two new hacker roles (the forensics ninja and the traffic spoofer) to complement the powers of the other players.&#10;&#10;[d0x3d!] v2 is released with a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0), allowing for the free sharing and remixing of the game.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "When your two choices are make laws, or go to prison, you&rsquo;ll scrape the bottom of the barrel to stay free.&#10;&#10;ACHTUNG! is an abstract strategy game about creating a multitude of pointless laws and annoying rules for everyone in the game to follow.&#10;&#10;As players draw and play cards, the number of laws continues to build until it becomes impossible for the average player to follow them all. When a player breaks a law, and someone else notices, they get called out by having ACHTUNG! shouted at them, and they must discard from their hand of cards. Once a player loses all of their cards, they&rsquo;re put in the gulag and must catch someone else breaking a law to re-enter the game. The game is over when a lone lawmaker remains.&#10;&#10;The gameplay is separated into 5 distinct card types: Global Laws that everyone at the table must follow, Directed Laws that only effect a single player, Amendments that modify the text of cards already on the table, Filibusters that interrupt the main-game for a chance to win valuable cards, and Abolish cards that remove other cards from play.&#10;&#10;ACHTUNG! is currently in its second edition. The second edition contains updates to the first edition rules and cards, such as allowing players to place markers on law cards to point out individual laws to play. Adjustments have also made to the Filibuster cards in the second edition to speed up gameplay.&#10;&#10;",

An invisible murderer is walking through the Town &mdash; merciless, weightless, and listless. No one knows how to protect themselves against it or who is to become its next victim. Seems like the Town is doomed &mdash; yet, those of its inhabitants who are privy to the mystery of its internal structure are still trying to fight back. Their efforts and hopes are guided by the knowledge and the will of three outstanding persons.&#10;&#10;Tabletop Pathologic is an asymmetrical stealth action game intended for 2&ndash;4 players. Three of them become doctors trying to save the Town, while the fourth takes on the role of the Sand Plague. In order to complete missions the doctors have to risk themselves and their Entwined companions, but it&rsquo;s their only chance to win. The Plague remains unseen until it decides to strike&mdash;and then it strikes mercilessly.&#10;&#10;Tabletop Pathologic is designed after Pathologic the videogame and strives to keep what made its predecessor special: the atmosphere a town in agony, the feeling of doom and the desperate hope of those who have nothing else left. It&rsquo;s precisely this hope that makes the three doctors pursuing the same goal become rivals. There&rsquo;s only one winner in the game, so contesting other players is unavoidable.&#10;&#10;The board game is available as a reward for backing the remake of Pathologic the video game on Kickstarter. After its release, Tabletop Pathologic will be sold separately.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Regatta is a combinatorial game for two players. It's the follow-up to Tixel, which itself is a follow-up to Tix.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player can either place a new piece or move one of her own pieces already on the board. Pieces can be placed either side up, effectively mirroring the shape of the piece. The only way to change which side is facing up is by first picking up a piece in one turn (as a bonus move action, see below), and then placing it anew in another turn with the other side facing up.&#10;&#10;A piece can be &quot;active&quot; or &quot;inactive&quot;; only active pieces, which are at a 45&ordm; angle, may be moved. Making pieces inactive is done by moving next to or passing an active piece.&#10;&#10;Chaining moves is important as this temporarily unlocks three additional move types (aside from placing or moving a piece). If a piece that is moved is made inactive at its end position &mdash; i.e., it is self-inactivated &mdash; a player can take an extra move if she so chooses; aside from placing or moving a piece, she can now remove a piece from the board, activate an inactive piece, or pivot an active piece to reorient it.&#10;&#10;Another difference between Regatta and Tix/Tixel is that in Regatta pieces aren't at any time allowed to protrude outside of the board.&#10;&#10;There's also a variant that allows the game to be played by three players.&#10;&#10;",

The game uses the same basic rules used in an entire series on the battles and campaigns of the World Wars. Learning this simple game prepares you for playing games on almost every battle and every campaign of the Der Weltkrieg series.&#10;&#10;The Historical Background&#10;Tannenberg &ndash; The Introductory Game covers the Russian invasion of German East Prussia in 1914, and the subsequent German counter thrusts.&#10;&#10;The Russians plan to invade Germany from two directions at once, trapping the Germans in the middle. The Russians vastly outnumbered their foes, as the bulk of the German army is invading France at the onset of war. The Germans plan to conduct a fighting withdraw from East Prussia, but their commanding General panics.&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s up to you to determine the outcome. Will your decisions produce Victory or Defeat?&#10;&#10;The Tannenberg battle in this game is a smaller version of the Tannenberg battle in the 2-scenario box Tannenberg: Eagles in the East / Galicia: The Forgotten Cauldron and the 6-scenario box The Eastern Front: 1914-1917. (The larger versions can be combined into larger scenarios or campaigns.)&#10;&#10;",

This new 108-card deck allows you to play rummy, but also can be used to play games like poker, solitaire, and bull$#@! (aka Cheat).&#10;&#10;What sets this apart from past combinations of rummy and word games is the scoring system.  Very much similar to classic rummy, letter cards are colored according to their rarity, and thus their points.  The most rare are 15 points, like aces.  The less common are 10 points, like face cards, and the common cards are 5 points.  There are also 4 wilds, which score 0 points.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Game based on a character in a Spanish children's series.&#10;&#10;All the cards are dealt out and play continues in the same way as quartet games. You ask another player for a certain numbered card. If that person has it, the card is given to the player who asked for it. Then he may ask another player (or the same player again) for another numbered card. If he gets a positive response, his turn continues. But if the player asked does not have that cards, the questioner's turn ends and the player asked starts the next round of questions.&#10;&#10;The object is to lay face-down in front of you any set of 3 consecutively numbered cards. These are safe and cannot be taken by anyone else. On future turns you may add further numbers as long as they are of a consecutive number. When all the cards are placed in such 'runs', the game ends and the player with the most cards, wins.&#10;&#10;",

The game involves drawing cards up to &quot;200&quot; without overdrawing them, so it can be played by children so long as they can count to 20. Objects found locally in Gunma appear in this quick party game.&#10;&#10;From the Publisher:&#10;&quot;&#227;&#128;&#142;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#228;&#186;&#140;&#231;&#153;&#190;&#228;&#184;&#135;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#230;&#176;&#151;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#231;&#190;&#164;&#233;&#166;&#172;&#231;&#156;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#144;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#189;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#232;&#187;&#189;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#163;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#239;&#188;&#146;&#239;&#188;&#144;&#239;&#188;&#144;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#131;&#148;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#176;&#161;&#229;&#141;&#152;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#10;&#239;&#188;&#144;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#239;&#188;&#146;&#239;&#188;&#144;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#182;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#231;&#174;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#230;&#157;&#165;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#229;&#173;&#144;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#230;&#165;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#230;&#157;&#165;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#231;&#190;&#164;&#233;&#166;&#172;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#131;&#183;&#229;&#156;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#230;&#175;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#131;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#229;&#189;&#185;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#232;&#166;&#129;&#231;&#180;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#229;&#190;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#233;&#128;&#134;&#232;&#187;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#232;&#181;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#239;&#188;&#159;&quot;&#10;&#10;",

A key tension in Karmaka is that after playing a card for its ability, a rival may take the card into their Future Life. Your actions may come back to haunt you in the next life...&#10;&#10;Score points to ascend while sowing the seeds of your next life, and &ndash; if necessary &ndash; sabotage your rivals. But remember, what goes around comes around, and your actions have consequences in this life...and the next.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "144: Champions of Hope is a blend of Euro-Victory Point Race and Theme-Heavy Ameritrash strategy game for 2-4 players. Set in the world of Traesparin, the setting for the novels 144: Wrath and 144: Redemption, players take on the role of Champions to expand, build, and battle their way into legend. Recruit fearless Heroes and discover powerful Artifacts as you amass your forces. Will you master arcane magic or win through the strength of steel? Champions can even join together to take on greater threats as they vie for the most Glory.&#10;&#10;Players start the game with two Lands under their control. Each turn, the controlling Champion (the player whose turn it is) rolls a ten-sided die for Production. The result of the role is compared to their Lands and Resources are acquired by all players accordingly. The controlling Champion can then use acquired Resources to expand to new Lands (thereby increasing their Resource production), recruit Heroes (cards) to increase their Magic and/or Combat power, improve their land with Tower Upgrades that add to the Production roll's result, or purchase Artifacts (cards) that give Glory and additional passive or active benefits. Additionally, players may undertake secret Quests that provide Glory, primarily, at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The main source of Glory, however, is Battle. The controlling Champion will end his or her turn with the option of sending forces into Battle, challenging their choice of Rank 1-5. In Battle, Champions must choose whether they will fight with the strength of Combat or the power of Magic. The chosen Battle Rank card is turned over and the controlling Champion faces the challenge by rolling a ten-sided die and adding their chosen power. If the result exceeds the target, they win and receive both Glory and Reward (in the form of Resources). If they lose, Glory is lost.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the controlling Champion may solicit aid from another player before the Battle begins. Players can combine their powers to take on greater threats (and earn greater Glory) than they could on their own.&#10;&#10;End game is triggered when a player reaches 144 Glory (tracked around the edge of the game board). Points from Quest cards and remaining Resources are added in to determine the player with the most Glory, the Champion of Hope!&#10;&#10;",

Players initiate &quot;scrambles&quot; where they roll specially-designed &quot;target dice&quot; to create a target number, then roll &quot;number dice&quot; to see if they can score under that target number. If they do so, they can move their marker a specified number of steps up the mountain. They can choose to gamble and continue their &quot;scramble&quot; until they fail to meet their target.&#10;&#10;If the target roll is not met, they will fall back to where they started at the beginning of their turn. Additionally, they must pay a penalty. These penalties are devised at the start of the game by the players and provide the &quot;party&quot; atmosphere, since penalties can be things like &quot;Wash one dish in the sink,&quot; or &quot;Run around the room 10 times.&quot;&#10;&#10;Players also have three chances to knock a player's marker back down the mountain. This action, combined with the supposed humorous nature of the penalties, provides as the box says, &quot;An extremely unique and wildly intense party game for two to six players.&quot;&#10;&#10;According to the interior of the rule book, the first printing of this 1991 edition was of 3000 copies.&#10;&#10;",

You have a secret role and a secret objective, and if you accomplish it, you gain a point AND you steal someone's role. With that role you can try to gain more points and more roles.

Somewhere there are the fuel tanks you need. &#10;Can you find them in time?&#10;&#10;Aim of the Game!&#10;In this solitaire game, you must find three rocket fuel tanks and return to your spaceship before your spacesuit runs out of oxygen or battery power. If either of these levels drops below 1 during a systems check, you have lost the game.&#10;&#10;Needed to Play!&#10;The deck of Map Cards (30 cards)&#10;The deck of Event and Equipment Cards (21 cards)&#10;1 Suit Card showing your remaining oxygen and battery power + 2 Tracking Cards which also include the Quick Rules Guide&#10;1 Astronaut, 1 Spaceship, and 3 Fuel Tank counters&#10;&#10;Setting the Game Up!&#10;Shuffle the Map deck and deal the cards out face down in a 6 x 5 grid, there will be 5 rows of cards, each row will have 6 cards in it.&#10;&#10;Find the card on the grid with the Spaceship icon on it and turn this card over to the other side, placing your Spaceship and Astronaut on it.&#10;&#10;Playing the Game!&#10;Each turn of the game will consist of 3 phases:&#10;&#10;Phase 1. Movement&#10;At the beginning of your turn you must move your Astronaut, from the card it is currently on, any number of cards in an orthogonal direction (this means up or down, left or right). The first two cards in distance you move you may do so for free. For each additional card you move during the turn you must lose either 1 level of your Oxygen or 1 level of your Battery Power. Move the Tracking Cards down the Oxygen or Battery tracks as needed to record this. You may change directions as you move (i.e. 1 card to the left and then one card up). You may never move diagonally.&#10;&#10;You are trying to find, using your spacesuit&rsquo;s equipment, a series of numbered beacons (in pairs) which will locate where the 3 Fuel Tanks are stored. These beacons give you a set of coordinates (one beacon points up and down, the other points left and right). You will need to locate the pair of matching numbered beacons and then move to the card the beacons point to. In the example to the right, X marks the spot where one of the Fuel Tanks is located.&#10;&#10;Phase 2. Events and Equipment&#10;After you have finished moving you must now draw 3 cards from the Events and Equipment deck. This deck has two types of cards.&#10;If this deck is empty when you go to draw a card, shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck to draw cards from.&#10;&#10;A. Event Cards - these cause you to lose Oxygen or Battery Power due to your exploration.&#10;B. Equipment Cards - these cause you to gain resources you need (Oxygen and Battery Power), as well as give you special actions to help in your exploration.&#10;&#10;Keep the Equipment cards in your hand from one turn to the next. You will need a pair of the same cards to gain the listed bonus. You may have no more than three Equipment cards in your hand at the end of the Events and Equipment phase.&#10;&#10;Phase 3. Systems Check&#10;You must now check your Suit Systems. If either your Oxygen or Battery Power level is below 1 you have lost the game. Do not forget that you may spend a pair of matching cards at anytime during the System Check phase (Phase 3) to gain the listed bonus, by placing the cards on the discard pile.&#10;&#10;",

Plunder your way to glory and fame!&#10;&#10;In Piratoons, each turns begins with a treasure of boat parts and equipment being revealed. All at the same time, each Pirate rushes to allocate crew in an effort to plunder the best loot by placing their crew meeples on individual items as bids. Each piece of treasure goes to the player with the most crew invested in the item, but only after removing all tied bids. Therefore, Pirates need to stay alert for sneaky opportunities to cancel out an opponent's efforts or for chances to swoop in and steal a disputed treasure.&#10;&#10;The unclaimed loot is auctioned off with doubloons earned by your crew and then the ship construction begins. Pirates score points for having the most money or equipment, or having the fastest, best, or largest ship. Sets of tiles and unfilled boat sections also add and subtract from your score. The player with the most points after eight rounds is the most notorious Pirate.&#10;&#10;A featured component of the game is the central loot chest formed by two double-sided boards with raised edges. Before each turn this treasure chest gets loaded with random face-down treasure, then it's sealed, flipped, and revealed simultaneously to the eager Pirates by removing the board on top. The mad rush of plundering in real-time (there is a 15-second sand timer included) and the spatial puzzle to build the best ship possible are the key ingredients of the game's experience.&#10;&#10;",

The game tracks who is currently winning the argument by having the layout stepped towards the currently dominant player.

In each turn, players add two sticks to the board and earn points for the shapes created. With compelling game mechanics and exciting surprises, Three Sticks is a promising entertainer for both kids and adults.&#10;&#10;Players begin with six sticks, chosen randomly using reload cards. The three types of sticks, purple, orange and red, are 3, 4 and 5 units long respectively and can be placed along the blue dots marked on the board. While all three sticks can be placed horizontally or vertically, red stick can also be placed diagonally.&#10;&#10;Each player places two sticks in their turn, with each stick's tip touching the tip of at least one other stick on the board. If a geometric shape is created in the process, the player earns points. Points are awarded as per three parameters :&#10;1. Perimeter of the shape &#10;2. Bonus as per the type of the shape &#10;3. Points in blue circles, if the shape surrounds any such circles on the board.&#10;&#10;Once all six sticks are used, a player may collect six more by picking a reload card. Additionally, five power cards are distributed to each player at the beginning of the game. These cards provide special powers to the players that can improve their position in the game or slow down the progress of other players. The cards may be used in any turn up to a maximum of two per turn.&#10;&#10;The first player to reach a score of 500 wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

But he had no need of the moon to locate his target, his eyes were able to see in the darkness better than anyone else. He moved slowly, not to avoid making any noise, his movements were always soft, almost ethereal: never in his eternal life he had been sensed by his prey; a few more steps and he would be on target. It was there, unaware, helpless in front of his attack: a quickly and decisively move and it&rsquo;s neck would not have even realized to be drilled. No worries, no tension, the cold calm that always filled him, made him perfect for this task. Suddenly the beating of wings, a night bird, inappropriate and unwanted, alerted the defenseless creature. But it was too late to avoid the arrow...&#10;H. - Why he doesn&rsquo;t use his tentacles to destroy it?&#10;B.- Which vampire has tentacles or shoots arrows?&#10;J.- From immemorial time, orcs are killed by elves with bow and arrows.&#10;B.- You have turned the helpless girl, alone in the dark night, in a putrid orc?!

That said, VEC is a &quot;light game made for gamers&quot;, not a storytelling game.&#10;&#10;Players must acquire cards through an auction system. Cards represent the writer's ideas: protagonists, characters, events, places, items, encounters. Cards have special powers and players activate them to interact with other players (move cards, turn cards, refill energy, etc). The aim of the game is to move specific cards to a special zone of the table game area, called the NOVEL area. Cards must be placed there in the right sequence and type/color: each player has a different objective with a different sequence and colors, so as the result will be identical/similar to player objective, victory points will be scored. Card powers can be combined resulting in a huge number of play combinations creating many possible strategies.&#10;&#10;",

Each player starts with a married couple, the ancestral lord and his lady. Throughout the game new family members are added through birth and marriage. Three generational changes occur where the oldest generation perishes due to old age.&#10;&#10;The players take turns activating one of their characters or couples. An activation lets you pick a series of actions in a horizonal row on the character. Since a wife&rsquo;s actions are added to her husband&rsquo;s, activating couples can be more efficient than activating single characters.&#10;&#10;Players advance their influence in the game by waging war, earning gold and expanding their family. As the game progresses, more powerful nobles come into play. Red nobles are commanders: strong on warfare actions. Blue nobles are devout: strong on piety actions. Yellow nobles are tradesmen: strong on commerce actions. Green nobles are negotiators with special abilities or intrigue actions.&#10;&#10;Gold is used to buy extra actions, pay for wedding feasts, muster armies and pay for the education and finer upbringing of male heirs. Armies are used to wage war, bringing riches and prestige back from distant provinces. Prestige points are a measure of your influence on society. The player with the most prestige points at the end wins the game.&#10;&#10;While most daughters get married off to other families, the sons continue your family&rsquo;s bloodline. Games can be won and lost because of the right or wrong marriages.&#10;&#10;",

You navigate the mountain while exploring the man's thoughts as he contemplates about the unknown abyss that lies exactly after his life's biggest accomplishment.&#10;&#10;There are five exit points on the board, one for every element that will affect your journey - frost, sun, wind, sky and horizon. As you try and find the path down, you learn more about yourself through the story cards, divided into five different story lines that affect you as a protagonist.&#10;&#10;However, the path down is not immediately obvious. Your movement subdues and stimulates the elements. If three or four elements are acting, you start suffering from ennui; a feeling that perhaps getting to the bottom of the mountain is not that important after all. If all five elements are raging, you will succumb to nature and die.&#10;&#10;Traverse through the safest path and take care of yourself. This could be either the most important journey of your life, or your last.&#10;&#10;Story Writing by - Johnathan Harrington, Mathew Agius Muscat, Fran Borg&#10;&#10;",

Now is your opportunity to face off Poseidon against Ishtar! Thor against Cthulhu! Morrigan against Yog-Sothoth! You have one goal and one goal only: annihilate your foes' believers and seize absolute power.&#10;&#10;Achieve this task by staking the souls of your followers, using the same bluff, psychology, and tactics that have made Texas Hold 'em Poker the world's premier card game. Once you seize victory, you can rest, and listen to the cheerful song of your people. You have won the clash of the gods. You have won Theomachy.&#10;&#10;The game is quick to play &ndash; typically less than 45 minutes. First, choose your god. Then, drafting cards into your personal deck lets you slowly build your might. Ante up your followers, and stake them against your foes' minions. You can call, raise, or fold, in similar fashion to high-stakes Poker games (and what stake is higher than your own worshipers' souls?)&#10;&#10;Your spells are powered by a Constellation, which is laid down in the middle of the table as a Texas Hold'em Poker style flop, river, and turn. Just as in Hold 'em, some Constellation configurations provide you with great combinations for your secret hand of cards, some are disastrous, while most are middling to fair.&#10;&#10;Using miracles, spells, and powerful artifacts, powered by the Constellation, send your followers into battles, build temples, and inflict terrible curses on the unfaithful. You face a tough decision in every hand: do you put your power on the line to help your believers, or do you turn your back to cut your losses, abandoning them to certain death? If neither you nor your opponents yield, the showdown takes place - hurricanes are opposed by deathly plagues, tempests extinguish walls of fire, and the ranks of the faithful shrink every second.&#10;&#10;Use your god&rsquo;s power to create miracles and activate myth cards for your heroes, temples, and godly artifacts. For example, the Norse pantheon has access to the Fenris wolf, Thor's hammer, and more. Babylon has Lilith, Ur, the tower of Babel, and more. Even the Lovecraft pantheons have myth cards and their own dark miracles. Place Wilbur Whateley in the forefront of your fight, or wield the Pallid Mask!&#10;&#10;Theomachy: The Warrior Gods includes four pantheons: Celtic, Norse, Slavonic, and Lovecraft's Great Old Ones.&#10;&#10;",

However, all of them are well aware that in this field, they are not the only competitors. Therefore, you need to choose wisely. Will you quickly raise your rank by eliminating competitors, or will you safely complete your mission by tightly hiding your identity and gathering money? But as with all things, not only your skills but a good dose of luck is needed to succeed. Indeed, which fate will bring the dice today upon the secret agent that you are?&#10;&#10;H.I.D.E.: Hidden Identity Dice Espionage is a spy-themed dice game based on a deduction mechanism. By combining the information disclosed as the game goes on, try to find out other player's identity while hiding your own and gathering intel cards that are displayed in the middle of the play area. Each round you can choose by picking a die if you want to stay in the shadows or if you want to reveal some information about your identity while having the possibility to eliminate another spy. Whoever gathers the most money through intel cards or becomes the Legendary Spy wins.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "When gods fight, human blood flows. Theomachy lets you take the place of a high god &ndash; lord of a group of devoted followers. Now is your opportunity to face off Poseidon against Ishtar! Thor against Cthulhu! Morrigan against Yog-Sothoth! You have one goal and one goal only: annihilate your foes' believers and seize absolute power.&#10;&#10;Achieve this task by staking the souls of your followers, using the same bluff, psychology, and tactics that have made Texas Hold 'em Poker the world's premier card game. Once you seize victory, you can rest, and listen to the cheerful song of your people. You have won the clash of the gods. You have won Theomachy.&#10;&#10;The game is quick to play &ndash; typically less than 45 minutes. First, choose your god. Then, drafting cards into your personal deck lets you slowly build your might. Ante up your followers, and stake them against your foes' minions. You can call, raise, or fold, in similar fashion to high-stakes Poker games (and what stake is higher than your own worshipers' souls?)&#10;&#10;Your spells are powered by a Constellation, which is laid down in the middle of the table as a Texas Hold'em Poker style flop, river, and turn. Just as in Hold 'em, some Constellation configurations provide you with great combinations for your secret hand of cards, some are disastrous, while most are middling to fair.&#10;&#10;Using miracles, spells, and powerful artifacts, powered by the Constellation, send your followers into battles, build temples, and inflict terrible curses on the unfaithful. You face a tough decision in every hand: do you put your power on the line to help your believers, or do you turn your back to cut your losses, abandoning them to certain death? If neither you nor your opponents yield, the showdown takes place - hurricanes are opposed by deathly plagues, tempests extinguish walls of fire, and the ranks of the faithful shrink every second.&#10;&#10;Use your god&rsquo;s power to create miracles and activate myth cards for your heroes, temples, and godly artifacts. For example, the Norse pantheon has access to the Fenris wolf, Thor's hammer, and more. Babylon has Lilith, Ur, the tower of Babel, and more. Even the Lovecraft pantheons have myth cards and their own dark miracles. Place Wilbur Whateley in the forefront of your fight, or wield the Pallid Mask!&#10;&#10;Theomachy: The Ancients includes four pantheons: Greek, Babylonian, Egyptian, and Lovecraft's Outer Gods.&#10;&#10;",

But there is hitch: ferocious monsters are guarding the gems! If the warriors join forces they can defeat them. But the coward who, blinded by his greed, will not fight seriously might get his companions punished by the monsters! The warrior who will remain loyal and will betray at the right time is the genuine hero of this game.&#10;&#10;In Dungeon Busters, the players take the role of heroes exploring dungeons and defeating monsters in search of treasures. In order to defeat a monster, every player simultaneously plays a power card face-down then reveals the values. If two or more players play the same value, they are all ignored. If players are defeated the player who played the lowest value should return some treasures as a penalty. If players succeed to defeat the monster, players can divide rewards but the player who played the lowest value will go first.&#10;&#10;Japanese summary:&#10;&#10;&#229;&#141;&#148;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#232;&#163;&#143;&#229;&#136;&#135;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#160;&#177;&#233;&#133;&#172;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#155;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#230;&#173;&#166;&#229;&#153;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#148;&#187;&#230;&#146;&#131;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#229;&#139;&#135;&#230;&#176;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#161;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#229;&#188;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#230;&#173;&#166;&#229;&#153;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#230;&#140;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#229;&#174;&#157;&#231;&#159;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#133;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#173;&#187;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#141;&#177;&#233;&#153;&#186;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#232;&#191;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#230;&#182;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#233;&#161;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#152;&#152;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#187;&#178;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#163;&#143;&#229;&#136;&#135;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#228;&#186;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#230;&#178;&#162;&#229;&#177;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#174;&#157;&#231;&#159;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#133;&#165;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#230;&#157;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#231;&#156;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#149;&#181;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#137;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#239;&#188;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#231;&#172;&#145;&#233;&#161;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#232;&#169;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#233;&#154;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#132;&#227;&#131;&#187;&#227;&#131;&#187;&#227;&#131;&#187;&#239;&#188;&#159;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#131;&#128;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#180;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#128;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#131;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#187;&#178;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#141;&#148;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#230;&#149;&#181;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#128;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#187;&#178;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#230;&#138;&#156;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#232;&#163;&#143;&#229;&#136;&#135;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#228;&#186;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#231;&#156;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#133;&#165;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#191;&#161;&#233;&#160;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#231;&#150;&#145;&#230;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#142;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#128;&#144;&#239;&#188;&#136;&#233;&#157;&#158;&#239;&#188;&#137;&#229;&#141;&#148;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#229;&#158;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#128;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

Adventures, new ports and powerful rituals are waiting for you. Sometimes pirates have to rely on the other pirates, but don't forget that you can get stabbed in the back anytime.&#10;&#10;As the waves break on your ship, take a turn for the topsy-turvy motion of the ocean by rolling your ship dice &mdash; but remember that where they land on the board means as much as what you roll! Choose to remain an independent vagabond, or maybe cut a deal with a Governor to become all official-like in your pirating ways. Consult with a shaman to curse the other pirates or pay a visit to the cartographer to find a map with some hidden treasure.&#10;&#10;In the game, the turn begins with players choosing the character card whose action they want to play &mdash; because each character has its own ability to help you get rich quickly &mdash; and places it facedown in front of them. When everyone has chosen their character cards, the first player announces the characters one by one. When you hear your character, you reveal your character card and play your adventure, curse, or port card, and everyone gets involved in a new adventure, which usually ends with a grandiose sea battles, or some curse, or finding a new port.&#10;&#10;The pirate with the most booty wins the day, but a pirate's life isn't always on the up and up.

Unit's and counters represent squads, individual tanks, support weapons, crews, etc.&#10;&#10;This game can be played either stand alone with miniatures for 15mm, GHQ, or HO miniatures. The company also has several hex map and counter add on modules that can be used for more traditional non-miniatures based play.&#10;&#10;DOV is a fast paced set of game rules that strikes a good balance between realism in war game simulation play and playability. Unit cards contain detailed weapons, vehicle and nationality based attributes that give players a crisp experience of the small scaled fighting realities of that historical era.&#10;&#10;When combined with the add on modules for Flags of Valour, this system also integrates with a new kind of Fog of War set of mechanics never before used in war gaming.&#10;&#10;The base rules are an 80 page booklet, 12 page data book, Command and STRAT cards, along with a sheet of control and marking counters for Unit Status.&#10;&#10;Comes with data cards on the vast majority of German, American, Russian, British, and Commonwealth troops used during World War 2.&#10;&#10;",

A fun and challenging list game!&#10;Packed with 80 entertaining Strike Off list cards, plus rules.&#10;&#10;To play the game, you draw a card, read a question on it and the next player tries to list as many items that would answer the question as he/she can. I.e., if a card asks &quot;There have been 6 James Bond actors - name them&quot;, the following player would earn a point for each correctly named actor, and additional STRIKE OFF bonus of one point if they name all 6. The first player to reach 15 points wins.&#10;&#10;Alternatively, players can divide into teams or if they prefer longer or shorter game, they may agree on a different points total at the start of the game.&#10;&#10;",

The transition from dealing with visionary individuals to capturing large chunks of thousands of customers will be difficult. The choices you make will be hard ones: should you go with your gut and build what you think the market needs, or should you spend your sparse resources on experiments?&#10;&#10;Playing Lean simulates the experience of launching a successful product into a board game that can be played in two hours. Along the way, players will learn the core concepts and vocabulary of the Lean Startup. And they will remember it because they have experienced it.&#10;&#10;",

When the mage is placed it enacts whatever power is associated with its school of magic. For example, placing a Sorcery mage will remove an adjacent mage from the board. Other powers are passive, such as the Nature mage which cannot be directly targeted by any enemy mage. Players must use these powers in creative and strategic ways in order to defeat their opponent and make it to the end of the hall.&#10;&#10;",

Your group entered the base camp of the evil dude, but instead of the villain all you find in the basement is a giant bomb. To make matters worse, there is no easy way out &#194;&#150; the janitor has locked all the doors shut. The only escape route is via the roof. But there is no need to be afraid, because just like in every good action movie, the bomb will only explode when the (first) agent is taking off with the helicopter. Good for him, bad for the rest that is left behind.&#10;&#10;Upstairs - A game ...&#10;&#10;for a gang of up to four friends, where the one that comes second is the first to lose the game. So you all better hurry up, and race as fast as possible through the labyrinthine high-rise building, just to be the lucky, or in fact the only survivor. Upstairs is an excellent racing game with a great charm.&#10;&#10;In Upstairs, the 9 playing cards make up the high-rise building, from which the players have to escape. Not only do they have to run through the labyrinthine base, but also to dodge the extremely aggressive guards, who in the harder gaming variant can end the life of an agent faster than he would have liked. Winner is the first player to reach the roof. Only then will the jump &#194;&#150; naturally, and befittingly, in slow-motion - succeed in the nick of time, with the agent grabbing the skids of the descending helicopter, carried off to the next hotel, where wine, women and song are waiting for our hero. The short playing time of around 15 to 20 minutes makes Upstairs the perfect warm-up game for any games meeting.&#10;&#10;",

It can be played in under 10 minutes and offers surprising depth for a small game.&#10;&#10;The goal of Seven7s is to have the most points at the end of the game by having the highest total value of cards in your hard when endgame scoring is initiated. During the game, all players together build a community tableau with seven columns corresponding to the seven different types of cards in the game: 7 Ages of Man, 7 Colors of the Rainbow, 7 Deadly Sins, 7 Holy Virtues, 7 Lucky Gods, 7 Seas, and the 7 Wonders of the World.&#10;&#10;To begin, deal each player a starting hand of three cards, and place one card face up in the tableau to start the first column. On your turn, play a single card from your hand to the tableau to a column that matches that card. If no such column exists for that type of card, start a new column. Next, activate that card's ability, then draw back up to three cards in hand. Each of the seven different types of cards has a unique ability that offers lots of strategy and replayability.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the seventh card of a column is played. This card is played sideways and counts towards the hand of whoever played it for endgame scoring. Whoever has the most points in hand wins.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Hex6d is a scale-able strategy/family game for 2-6 players that takes, on average, 10-20 minutes to play. Manage your cards and playing pieces to win!&#10;&#10;The playing field consists of blank (black) hexes and numbered/lettered (purple) hexes that represent cards from a standard playing card deck.  Be the first player (at the end of your turn) to properly align your pawns on the playing field hexes so they individually match every card in your hand.  &#10;Ex: If a player has a 4, 5, and 9 in their hand, their pawns must be on a 4, 5, and 9.  If a players has a 6, 6, and J in their hand, their pawns must be on a 6, 6, and J.&#10;&#10;Set-Up:&#10;Standard game: Place the starting hex in the middle and then around that, the same number of Playing Field hexes as there are players.  The Playing Field hexes are oriented so the middle playing line is connected to the Starting hex and additional playing lines are able to connect to Playing Field hexes to the right and left (if they are being used).  &#10;Modified game (Number and/or Placement of Playing Field hexes): To make the game harder or easier, you can use less or more Playing Field hexes than the number of players.  Additionally, Playing Field hexes need not be connected to each other.  Example (on back page): You could have three Playing Field Hexes and neither of them connect.  Note:  It is recommended the number of Playing Field hexes should not be more or less than one, from the numbers of players.  Example: If there are 6 players and only 3 Playing Field hexes, the game could get congested.&#10;&#10;Modified game (Number of Pawns/Cards per Person):  To make the game harder or easier, players can start off with more or less than 3 pawns.  Each player must be dealt the same number of cards as they have pawns.&#10;&#10;Pawn Movement:&#10;Ace through 10, move one pawn a respective number of hexes: A = 1 hex, 2 = 2 hexes, 3 = 3 hexes, 4 = 4 hexes, &hellip;. 9 = 9 hexes, 10 = 10 hexes.&#10;Jack = Move an opponent&rsquo;s pawn 5 hexes.&#10;Queen = Move one or more of your pawns a total of 5 hexes.&#10;King = Move one of your pawns anywhere from 1 to 5 hexes.&#10;Joker = Everyone&rsquo;s cards/hand are passed to the right.  Note: No pawns are moved.&#10;&#10;",

The game consists solely of ten tunnel cards that each bear earthworms in their paths, and players take turns placing these in order to get their mole to the worms.&#10;&#10;In the beginning of the game, two cards are placed and one worm is attached to every worm-sign. The active player places a new card &mdash; every card is printed on front and back with different tunnels &mdash; and attaches a worm again. Then he moves his mole as far as possible, taking every worm on the way, but sometimes it's better to move not so far in order to have an advantage for his next turn.&#10;&#10;When all ten cards have been placed, the second phase of the game starts. Now the active player takes one already-placed card without a mole, removes all remaining worms to the storage, then places it again, attaching worms again, too. In the second phase, players have the opportunity to enter the connecting tunnels of the other players.&#10;&#10;The player who has found the most worms at the end of the day is hailed as the greatest earthworm hunter.&#10;&#10;",

It translates as &quot;Princess Knight, run away?&quot;.&#10;&#10;In the game, one of the players plays the Princess Knight to escape, and the other players play the Orcs, teaming up to catch the princess. Players draft action cards and the Orc team members work cooperatively but in silence. So it becomes difficult to select the right cards to win. Players need to draft cards and read each other's thoughts well to win.&#10;&#10;Publisher summary:&#10;&quot;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#175;1&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#167;&#171;&#233;&#168;&#142;&#229;&#163;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#168;3&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#229;&#150;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#230;&#140;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#231;&#181;&#130;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#167;&#171;&#233;&#168;&#142;&#229;&#163;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#141;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#130;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#229;&#150;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#167;&#171;&#233;&#168;&#142;&#229;&#163;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#233;&#128;&#131;&#227;&#129;&#146;&#229;&#136;&#135;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#167;&#171;&#233;&#168;&#142;&#229;&#163;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#131;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#140;1&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#129;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#229;&#150;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#187;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#231;&#132;&#161;&#232;&#168;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#128;&#163;&#230;&#144;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#167;&#171;&#233;&#168;&#142;&#229;&#163;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#228;&#184;&#141;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#132;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#231;&#162;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#232;&#170;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#177;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&quot;&#10;&#10;",

The game then alternates in phases of &ldquo;night&rdquo;, in which werewolves agree to covertly kill a villager, and &ldquo;day&quot;, in which villagers debate the identities of the werewolves and vote to kill a suspect. Play continues until all of the werewolves have been killed, or until the werewolves outnumber the villagers.&#10;&#10;THE CARDS&#10;&#10;There are NO DUPLICATES in the Werewolf House deck of over 36 different character cards. Each card features a unique, full color character illustration, so even after dozens of game rounds players will still be discovering new art.&#10;&#10;CORE CARDS - The base version of the game can be played by 7-12 people, using 6-10 basic villager cards and 1-2 werewolf cards - all included in the Werewolf House deck.&#10;&#10;ADVANCED CARDS - It&rsquo;s fun to mix it up. Dozens of characters with unique abilities have been carefully curated to add complexity to the gameplay, without burdening the moderator with messy role management tasks.&#10;&#10;",

That's the world of Steam Spy, a Steampunk themed role playing card game for 2 players. Steam Spy unites the character development and narrative of a traditional role playing game with the intimacy and spontaneity of a card game.&#10;&#10;Players create a unique secret agent character who works for one of the organizations designated to protect and serve one of the world&rsquo;s largest corporations. Then they face off against an operative from an opposing secret industrial organization in a one on one battle of wits, luck and exotic steampunk gadgets. One player instigates some kind of espionage mission while the other does their best to stop them.&#10;&#10;Players collect, play and draw cards that help create a series of exciting encounters that ultimately determine if the instigating antagonists succeeds at their mission, or the determined protagonist chases them down and defeats them; players then advance their spy character, or create a group of secret agent specialists in preparation for the next face off against operatives from opposing agencies and corporation.&#10;&#10;Steam Spy: Intelligence and Propaganda includes allows you to become one of the top spies for M5, the Western European agency that works to collect and protect information for the massive Encyclopedia Englandia Corporation. Or you can join Das Wort, one of the original &ldquo;reality defining&rdquo; news organizations. In order to present the world as they want it to be seen (in addition to selling papers), their mysterious organization, the Diamond Club, is often accused of creating events of world significance.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "This game has a very interesting &quot;back story&quot; in the convoluted early history of the Monopoly game.  It is based on the expired 1904 Elizabeth Magie patent for The Landlord's Game.&#10;&#10;In 1934, Charles Darrow tried to sell his version of Monopoly to Milton Bradley, but they passed on it, knowing the real history of the game.  He took Monopoly to Parker Brothers and the rest is history.&#10;&#10;As Monopoly began to become very popular in 1935, Milton Bradley came out with their own &quot;property trading&quot; game, Easy Money.  This was based in part on Monopoly and also Finance, which was another very similar game that had been on the market since 1932.&#10;&#10;A race ensued to see who could patent this type of game first.  The patent office decided that these games were derived from The Landlord's Game.  Parker Brothers purchased the second Landlord's patent from Elizabeth Magie Phillips in November 1935, and Charles Darrow was granted a patent on Monopoly (as an &quot;improved version&quot;) the following month.&#10;&#10;Parker Brothers then pressured Milton Bradley to change Easy Money, and remove what they considered aspects of the game that infringed on Monopoly.  This included the use of property cards.&#10;&#10;Milton Bradley went along with this, but in 1937, perhaps as a bit of &quot;payback,&quot; they briefly marketed this game Carnival, based on the earlier (expired) Landlord's Game patent.  This game has what amounts to property cards (the &quot;Concessions&quot;).&#10;&#10;So, it may very well be that this game was put on the market by Milton Bradley largely to thumb their noses at Parker Brothers.  There was nothing Parker could do to prevent it.&#10;&#10;The iconography on the game board also ties it in directly to Easy Money, since the exact same Bank illustration is used.  There are also references to &quot;concessions&quot; and it's very possible this is all in the nature of &quot;subtext&quot; as part of a dialogue between the two major game makers.&#10;&#10;It was only available for sale for a brief period of time, perhaps just long enough for Milton Bradley to make their point about patents.  Parker Brothers had been attempting to get a third trading game patent (and actually did so in Canada), but they gave up on the effort in the United States, and this game may have played a part in it.&#10;&#10;If Milton Bradley had challenged the Monopoly patent in court, it likely would have been invalidated, and Parker Brothers knew this.&#10;Some of the other early Monopoly-related variants are quite valuable (the Knapp/Electronic Laboratories &quot;Finance,&quot; &quot;Boondoggling,&quot; Rudy Copeland's &quot;Inflation,&quot; Cadaco's &quot;Movie Mart,&quot; the 1935 version of &quot;Easy Money,&quot; etc.) and this game is just about as rare as these are.&#10;&#10;",

But since they are initially face-down tiles, you can't be sure which of your Knights are the stronger ones.&#10;&#10;The game was originally published in 2012 and a new edition with updated artwork was released in 2017, but gameplay remains the same.&#10;&#10;Publisher summary:&#10;&#231;&#165;&#158;&#232;&#129;&#150;&#227;&#131;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#229;&#184;&#157;&#229;&#155;&#189;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#231;&#169;&#186;&#228;&#189;&#141;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#228;&#187;&#163;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#136;&#158;&#229;&#143;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#233;&#131;&#189;&#229;&#184;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#148;&#175;&#233;&#133;&#141;&#230;&#168;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#186;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#233;&#168;&#142;&#229;&#163;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#156;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#233;&#133;&#141;&#231;&#189;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#233;&#128;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#229;&#139;&#162;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#233;&#129;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#233;&#133;&#141;&#231;&#189;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#228;&#184;&#150;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#136;&#158;&#229;&#143;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#233;&#131;&#189;&#229;&#184;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#232;&#178;&#180;&#230;&#151;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#148;&#175;&#233;&#133;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#230;&#140;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#229;&#143;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#228;&#184;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#168;&#142;&#229;&#163;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#230;&#173;&#166;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#131;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#140;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#233;&#131;&#189;&#229;&#184;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#148;&#175;&#233;&#133;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#191;&#133;&#232;&#166;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#232;&#178;&#180;&#230;&#151;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#228;&#184;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#233;&#168;&#142;&#229;&#163;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#158;&#154;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#231;&#155;&#184;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#229;&#155;&#158;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#229;&#191;&#133;&#232;&#166;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#233;&#168;&#142;&#229;&#163;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#230;&#142;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#231;&#167;&#187;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#233;&#160;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#233;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#166;&#129;&#231;&#180;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

Twelve market tokens worth 4-8 are placed at random on the empty rectangular area representing Amsterdam. A single canal rings the city.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the active player draws one of their influence tokens at random, then either:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Places it on an empty space on the board, or&#10;    Discards it, then places as many canals (wooden sticks) on the board as the number on that token.&#10;&#10;&#10;When an area is enclosed that contains one or two market tokens, whoever has the most influence in this area gains all of the tokens as well as wealth (VP tokens) equal to the number of spaces in this area. If players are tied for influence, then they sum the market tokens and area wealth and split this, rounding down.&#10;&#10;When all markets are controlled, or all players are out of tiles, or all canals have been placed, the game ends and the wealthiest player wins.&#10;&#10;Canals of Amsterdam includes two variants, one in which each player starts with a single canal in reserve that can be used at any time on their turn and another in which players each have a hand of three influence tokens.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary:&#10;&#10;&#228;&#184;&#150;&#231;&#149;&#140;&#233;&#129;&#186;&#231;&#148;&#163;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#128;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#129;&#139;&#230;&#178;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#187;&#186;&#231;&#175;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#161;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#229;&#137;&#178;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#230;&#148;&#175;&#233;&#133;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#229;&#137;&#178;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#168;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#229;&#134;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#229;&#184;&#130;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#239;&#188;&#145;&#239;&#189;&#158;&#239;&#188;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#168;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#231;&#162;&#186;&#229;&#174;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#174;&#181;&#233;&#154;&#142;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#229;&#189;&#177;&#233;&#159;&#191;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#168;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#229;&#134;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#143;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#168;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#229;&#134;&#133;&#229;&#184;&#130;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#156;&#159;&#229;&#156;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#148;&#175;&#233;&#133;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;",

The first player to rebuild both brickprints using bricks of their color (red or blue) is the winner!&#10;&#10;Each round, all four dice are rolled, then players alternate turns by choosing one die from the shared pool and placing it onto the game board to collect bricks of their color, connect bricks in their collection, or manipulate future die rolls. When all of the dice are placed on the board, the round ends, turn order changes, and a new round begins.&#10;&#10;However, a player can &quot;bump&quot; a die off an occupied action space. A bumped die is rolled and returned to the shared pool, extending the round by one turn. By strategically choosing when to bump -- and when not to -- you might be able to eke out a few extra actions over the course of the game!&#10;&#10;Brick Work is a fast, fun, deceptively strategic game that combines the joy of brick building with creativity, puzzle solving, and modern game mechanisms.&#10;&#10;",

There are 5 different types of cards, that are played in different ways, allowing for chaining of multiple cards, forcing other players to draw cards, and skipping other players, making for a fun and friendly competition to win-while also cooperating to tell a funny story.&#10;&#10;On each player&rsquo;s turn, s/he plays one or more cards and uses whatever word is on the card in a sentence that continues the story, and starts with &ldquo;Yes, and.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;The humor tends to come naturally by just following the rules of the game. There is no pressure to be funny or creative, and really anyone can tell a funny story.&#10;&#10;",

Grecia it is not necessary an adult game, although by experience I have noted that when is the case of having only adults playing it, mostly end becoming one.&#10;&#10;Every player must choose one among the eight characters available for playing; they impersonate a Hero or Heroine who wants to become a God. In order to do that, the player must advance his pawn through the game board to the finish place, Mount Olympus. The player  simply throw the dice and moves across the game board, adding or subtracting modifiers as he can, using his Drachma coins to gather advantage over the other players.&#10;&#10;There are several things that a player can do in order to win some extra points for boosting his pawn and get first to the finish line. He can win extra Drachma coins by winning some challenge, for example. Besides that, that are some events that can punish the player who lost a challenge, or simply got unlucky on the dice toss. The punishment often involves some drinking or some nudity but, as always, that all can be avoided spending some Drachma coins. In the end, the &quot;temperature&quot; of the game tends to increase, but it will depends on the group of players because the limits are decided before by the players.&#10;&#10;Description from the back of the box:&#10;Welcome to ancient Greece! A fascinating place where gods vie followers as heroes struggle to get a seat on Mount Olympus. In this game, you will play a hero with a great ambition: Becoming a god. For this you should go through a tortuous path, full of intrigue, riddles and many wine-fueled orgies.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to be the first to reach Mount Olympus. Players will have to go a long way to go facing obstacles, challenging mythological creatures and doing rituals and offerings to the gods to get to your destination.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Shootout! The High Noon Card Game casts you and your friends as cowboys in the wild west. The most dangerous duelist is the one who makes the best hand possible. Once you've got the best weapons, the most impressive title, and familiarized yourself with your foe, you'll want to pick a fight with someone else at the table- If they don't come looking for trouble before you're ready for 'em. Experience tense, high-stakes western duels as players square off one by one until the last gunslinger standing wins. It is best suited for 2-6 players ages 9 and up and a round takes about 5 minutes per player.&#10;&#10;To begin every player is dealt five cards. Each turn a player reveals a card, draws a card, and discards a card before the turn passes to the next. The heart of the game is the information a player gives about what they are already holding by what they choose to take and what they discard. Using this information (or misinformation, at the highest levels of play) allows you to improve your chances by reading your opponent and evaluating your options-- It's basically the super-exciting high-stakes game of poker that only exists in the movies.&#10;&#10;The lean, 88-card deck has been balanced to a very deliberate point to make it an ideal family game. Special cards are very clear and provide their entire ruels explanation on them in order to keep the fun moving along. The elements of chance allow children, grandparents, and those totally unfamiliar with games to still have a fair chance of turning things around and winning in the end without leaving the outcome purely to chance like many other family games. This game was built from the start to provide fast, clear, fun gameplay that rewards investment without demanding any from the player. The game is light on text and appropriate for all ages.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Your last village was ransacked by barbarians. You barely had time to pick up the baby and your favorite fishing pole before they started the burning and pillaging. You wandered over a cruel desert, braved frozen peaks, and even paddled a log across a rough sea, kicking at the sharks whenever they got too close, the baby strapped tightly to your back.&#10;&#10;Then you found it! The perfect place to make your new home. But as soon as you had the first hut built, you discovered a vast network of caverns underground, brimming with shiny treasures, rare resources, and untold adventure. How could you limit your new village to the surface? You immediately start organizing expeditions and building houses underground as well as on the surface.&#10;&#10;With any luck, you'll build a village even stronger than your last-- strong enough, even, to turn away the barbarians the next time they come knocking.&#10;&#10;Above and Below is a mashup of town-building and storytelling where you and up to three friends compete to build the best village above and below ground. In the game, you send your villagers to perform jobs like exploring the cave, harvesting resources, and constructing houses. Each villager has unique skills and abilities, and you must decide how to best use them. You have your own personal village board, and you slide the villagers on this board to various areas to indicate that they've been given jobs to do. Will you send Hanna along on the expedition to the cave? Or should she instead spend her time teaching important skills to one of the young villagers?&#10;&#10;A great cavern lies below the surface, ready for you to explore-- this is where the storytelling comes in. When you send a group of villagers to explore the depths, one of your friends reads what happens to you from a book of paragraphs. You'll be given a choice of how to react, and a lot will depend on which villagers you brought on the expedition, and who you're willing to sacrifice to succeed. The book of paragraphs is packed with encounters of amazing adventure, randomly chosen each time you visit the cavern.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the player with the most well-developed village wins!&#10;&#10;The Kickstarter version of the game included the following items which are not found in the Retail version:&#10;&#10;     Villager Tool tokens&#10;     Lost Villagers&#10;     Swamp Villagers&#10;     Exclusive Stretch goals:&#10;     Creature Villagers&#10;     Quest Tokens&#10;     Underforest Tokens and PDF story book&#10;     Desert Labyrinth tokens and PDF story book &#10;     Wooden Goods&#10;&#10;&#10;This collection of items can be found in Above and Below: Expanded Edition Exclusives&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "A) The idea behind Blitzball is to recycle the game BloodBowl, an all other game similar to BloodBowl (Kaosball, Slaughterball, Elfball, etc&hellip;).&#10;&#10;With BlitzBall, you can use any figures you want, provided you can classify them into 4 classes :&#10;a. Leader.   b. Receiver.   c. Marauder.  d. Blocker.&#10;&#10;For example, a human thrower in BloodBowl may be recycled in Leader for the game BlitzBall.&#10;A human catcher may be recycled in...Receiver.&#10;An Orc lineman may be recycled in Marauder.&#10;An Orc Blitzer may be recycled in Blocker. Etc..&#10;&#10;You don't have any figure ? Tokens, symbolizing players, are provided with the game.&#10;&#10;B) At the beginning of a match of BlitzBall, you choose a team of 12 players, and you field 9 of them in the pitch (so 3 are on the bench).&#10;Instead of using the specific pitch of Blitzball, you can use the pitch of Bloodbowl : in this case, you choose a team of 14 players, and you field 11 of them in the pitch (so 3 are on the bench).&#10;&#10;Each position has its own profile :&#10;Movement, Brutality, Resilience, Agility, Passing, Control, Initiative.&#10;&#10;In order to have a fluid game, there are NO special skills in BlitzBall.&#10;All aspects of this game is managed by the player's profiles.&#10;Movement : used for ...movements.&#10;Brutality: used for tackles.&#10;Resilience: used for knocked down players, in order to avoid serious injuries.&#10;Agility: used when a player throws, catches, or picks up the ball.&#10;Passing : used when a player throws the ball. A good Passing allows a player to make longer passes.&#10;Control : used when a player kicks the ball, or attempts a Field Goal.&#10;Also the Control is used to give inspiration to teammates.&#10;Initiative : used when a player wants to perform complex movements (feint, jump, sprint, blitz). Also used to pick up the ball in certain conditions.&#10;&#10;C) What about the turn sequence ?&#10;At the beginning of the game a team makes a kick-off.&#10;Then it's the turn (called activation) of the receiving team, followed by the turn of the kicking team, etc...until a team scores (TouchDown or FieldGoal). At this stage, the scoring team makes a kick-off, and so on...&#10;&#10;D) What happens during a turn (activation) ?&#10;Normally, a coach (you or your opponant) activates up to 3 players.&#10;It is a standard activation : only 3 players are activated, and they can performs any actions allowed in the game.&#10;Sometimes a coach may opt for another mode of activation : Pass mode, Kick mode, Defense Mode, Movement Mode, depending on the tactical situation on the pitch. For example, the Movement mode improves the movements of the players, allows to activate the entire team in some conditions, but the only action allowed is &quot;Moving&quot;. Same thing for the Pass mode. The Kick Mode activates only the ball carrier and allows to escape from adverse pressure.&#10;The Defense mode is the best mode if you want to tackle the opposing ball carrier, but this mode is available only if you roll the appropriate number on the dice...&#10;&#10;E) End of game and scoring.&#10;You and your opponent agree on a time limit (45, 60 or 90 minutes), or on a maximum scoring (30 points for example), etc...&#10;A team scores with TouchDown (5 or 7 points), Field Goal (3 points), or eliminated opponents (2 points).&#10;&#10;F) Style of Play.&#10;Special cards are provided with the game : they allow to customize the style of play for your team : Pass play, Run play, Aggressive Play, Tactical Play, Polyvalent play, Mixed play.&#10;&#10;G) Edited february 18, 2016. You have 2 types of optional players : Goliath and Flanker.&#10;&#10;",

Luckily, he is still in command of Rome&rsquo;s most prestigious army. He has heard rumors of the riches coming back with the traders from Gaul. When reports of unrest among the Helvetii and a threat of invasion from the Germanic Suebi, the opportunity could be ripe for him to &ldquo;help&rdquo; the Gauls&hellip;&#10;&#10;Take on the role of a Gallic chieftain as you rally your tribe in an ultimately futile attempt to turn back the tides of history. You will navigate your chieftain pawn around the map while generating and spending site-located resources (food, wood, wine, and gold) to amass an army and build the roads for them to travel. As you choose where to deploy your your defenses, Caesar and his generals begin a slow buy inexorable march from Rome, taking city by city until nothing is left. Do you race to the front? Or do you hunker down and wait for the final battle? Or do you use one of the small selection of political action cards to collaborate with the invading forces and hope for the best?&#10;&#10;Make sure Caesar tells the world about you and your tribe as he executes his campaign of glory, and guarantee your place in history.&#10;&#10;",

Although it is a simple roll and move game, the way you move depends on whether you roll a 1 or 2, or a 3-6. If you only roll numbers from 3 to 6, then you add these together and move forwards. But any roll of a 1 or 2 counts as a negative multiplier, and you might go forwards or backwards.&#10;&#10;For example: A roll of 3,4,6 gives you 3+4+6=16 forwards.

        "description": "User summary:&#10;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#185; (Dois) is a trick-taking card game from Japan. Dois means two in Portuguese, and in the game there are two decks, one for numbers and one for 4 suits. The decks are shuffled together and players are dealt a hand of 13 cards from the mix. You need at least 3 suit cards and 3 number cards in your hand to begin. Then players play a trick-taking game with trumps, after first predicting how many tricks they will win.&#10;&#10;The first play is two cards, a number and suit card. After that, you play one card, a number or a suit card, so that your other card still shows. In this way, you play out 12 tricks and score plus or minus points depending on your prediction. It is recommended to play out 8 games of Dois to get a balanced match.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary:&#10;&quot;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#229;&#133;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#230;&#150;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;1&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#164;2&#230;&#158;&#154;&#228;&#189;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#132;1&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#229;&#136;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;2&#229;&#155;&#158;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#228;&#187;&#165;&#233;&#153;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#231;&#137;&#135;&#230;&#150;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#155;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#230;&#143;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#228;&#186;&#139;&#229;&#137;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#143;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#186;&#136;&#230;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#128;&#154;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#133;&#165;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;8&#227;&#131;&#135;&#227;&#130;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#231;&#181;&#130;&#228;&#186;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#171;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&quot;&#10;&#10;",

That person chooses a dealer.&#10;    Deal 4 cards to each player and everyone discards 1 &#10;&#10;&#10;Form a discard pile next the remainder of cards which is now the draw pile.&#10;&#10;    Each player will organize the cards in their hand and hold then face up in front of them. Only the top card will be visible. The game consists of always showing one card from your hand while the rest of your hand is underneath.&#10;&#10;&#10;Play:&#10;The person to go first will decide on who will get the first card. They may choose themselves or any other player. &#10;&#10;    They will draw one card from the draw pile and give it to that person face up so everyone can see.&#10;&#10;&#10;That card is to be played on the card showing in that players hand. &#10;&#10;    If it&rsquo;s a match, it lights a firework showing as the action on the card goes into effect. &#10;    If it&rsquo;s a lighter, the player gets to decide on the card in the other persons hand they wish to act on, but they don&rsquo;t get to look, just announce. Ex. 2nd card, 3rd card down.&#10;    if it&rsquo;s a firework card it goes on the top of the pile in that player&rsquo;s hand.&#10;    a match or lighter played on a match or lighter just gets added to that player&rsquo;s hand with no action.&#10;    The player who was chosen will go next. (You could keep choosing yourself, but there are M80&rsquo;s in the deck that will wipe you out).&#10;&#10;&#10;Conclusion:&#10;Play continues until there are no more cards to draw. The cards left in your hand at the end of the game are totalled and scored. if you have any cards in front of you as result of the dud, you add them to your hand total and that&rsquo;s your score. The highest score wins. If a tie, the player with the most of the highest point value cards wins.&#10;&#10;",

So, feel free to explore this dazzling zoo and look how colorful our zoo is, and make sure that you won't feel dizzy after visiting our zoo. Have fun!&#10;&#10;Dazzling Zoo is a game that need players to recognize different conditions the next card shows on its back. There are 3 conditions on each card's back, which is 'animal', 'animal's color', and 'living place'. Once the zoo face shows up, player need to figure out the right answer and touch the right tile as soon as possible. However, players should also beware of trapping situation, that if the zoo face is exactly the same as the answering tile, the right tile immediately becomes the wrong tile. Therefore, it is not a game for the quickest player, but for the player with cautiousness as well.&#10;&#10;",

During each turn, both players choose a &quot;move&quot; card from their hands. Moves might attack, block or evade at a particular location (high or low) and speed. The chosen moves are then simultaneously revealed and compared, usually dealing damage or shifting the initiative.&#10;&#10;The guessing game is never exactly the same; chosen cards may not be used again for a time, taking damage gives players the opportunity to secretly upgrade their moves, and each player also has a unique character card with special moves.&#10;&#10;Dragon Punch was designed to be very portable: It consists of only a few cards, and it also doesn't require a table or other surface to play. This means you can have a quick brawl against a friend almost anywhere!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "&quot;RUS: Age of the Vikings&quot; is a strongly themed military and economic strategy wargame set in Viking Age Russia, in which up to 5 players compete to become Czar of the Rus.  It deliberately sets out to marry the elegant inclusivity of Eurogames with the thematic gameplay of a classic Amerigame.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players choose 6 of 9 Actions that drive the game.  Will you send out Envoys to engage in Diplomacy, Harvest your crops, Trade with foreign powers, Construct settlements, invest in Culture &amp; Technology or Recruit troops to engage in warfare?  The player who chooses the Action gains a bonus, but all other players simultaneously take part in each Action Phase that is chosen.&#10;&#10;It is possible to win the game without ever engaging in warfare, but for those who prefer blood, combat uses a Tactics Card system which means you have to out-think your opponent to beat them in battle.&#10;&#10;As in history, Politics Cards provide a random element, introducing new Kingdoms (like the Muscovites or the Golden Horde) or triggering good harvests, famine and ultimately the Black Death.&#10;&#10;The first player to score 8 Victory Points wins the game, but if the Black Death is triggered before this happens, all Kingdoms are hit by the plague.  The survivors then take stock to see who is the most powerful in the new world that emerges.&#10;&#10;With virtually no down-time and multiple routes to victory, RUS: Age of the Vikings provides a dynamic strategic experience within a playing time of about 30 mns per player.&#10;&#10;",

Excited by the discovery, you decided to make a bet. Everyone will explore the mine for five days. At the end of each day you will sell in the city, the crystals you extracted during this day. At the end of the fifth day, the dwarf who earned the most money will become the only owner of the mine.&#10;&#10;Following along the same lines as its predecessor, Ouro de Tolo, Quartz is fast and tense game of push-your-luck and risk management in which the players, acting as dwarven miners, try to secure the best crystals for themselves while keeping their &quot;colleagues&quot; at bay. Each turn a player has three choices:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Extract a crystal, i.e., pull a crystal from the bag.&#226;&#128;&#168;&#10;    Play a card that brings him advantages or causes problems for opponents.&#10;    Leave the mine for that workday and cash in sets of crystals collected that day.&#10;&#10;&#10;Some of the main differences to the previous game are that now theres is only five rounds, you have more strategic actions and every card is worth victory points at the end of the game, it's possible to save up crystals from one round to the other, whenever two unstable crystal explodes you get experience tokens that will save you later, and a set collection that can double or sum more cash each round.&#10;&#10;What do you say?

Each player has 4 ships (one aircraft carrier, two cruisers and one destroyer), 12 jets and 6 surface-to-surface missiles. On land area are airport, port, launchers of missiles and anti-aircraft guns.&#10;&#10;The main characteristic is that the game board is covered with a net of equilateral triangles. Vertices of these triangles are points at which the players hold position and move figurines.&#10;&#10;Players have task to shoot at the opponent's ships and planes, as well as targets on its territory. The destroyer is sunk when received one hit. The carrier and cruiser are sunk when they receive 3 hits. Each hit in any target counts as one point. The game lasts as long as players have airplanes, ships and missiles to shoot at opponent. The winner is the player who has the best ratio of given and received hits.&#10;&#10;",

You start with a set of eight chicken cards with values from 1 to 3 in your display in front of you. The auctioneer draws three cards from a pile and decides to show one or two of these cards to the other players; the other card(s) are kept secret. The auctioneer makes a bid, then the other players in clockwise order may make theirs. The highest bid wins the three cards from the pile &mdash; and has to pay with the cards from his display.&#10;&#10;The cards in the pile bring more value to your chicken (1-4) and blind hens, which is three points minus alone, but +5 together with a Golden Corn. A single Corn is worth 2 points.&#10;&#10;The 2015 edition of Blindes Huhn has mouse and hawk symbols on the cards for a variety of additional options and rules, making this new edition more than a simple reprint.&#10;&#10;",

If you get the questions right you score extra points in the game, with a bonus if you collect sets of 3 of the card types, by getting all three questions on a card correct. If you do you keep the card and add it to you set of those cards. There are also no double or triple words score blocks on the board, but point amounts for placing a vowel or consonant on a specific place on the board. The board looks like a Scrabble board, but the scoring just works different. The tiles also have a score amount as stated on the board. I would so think of this game as Scrabble, but with more bells and whistles.&#10;&#10;",

The aim isn't so much to kill your opponent as to force them out of the ring, sumo-style; once you damage their engines a bit they'll probably do it themselves just by accident, MAs are hard enough to control at the best of times.&#10;&#10;A lot of colonists think that the MAJ circuit is their ticket Earthside, and the prizes are certainly magnificent. But the tricks you learn docking with fuel ships or dodging bandits under the rings of Saturn don't prepare you for a Mobile Armour. There's nothing like it; these beasts are as twitchy as they are powerful. And that's not to mention that the Extra-Solar Tournament is the only open tourney that unranked knights from the colonies can even enter, and that's held right the way out in the Reaches where you're just as likely to be hit by a lump of floating rock as a missile from your opponent...&#10;&#10;MAJESTY - Mobile Armour Jousting: Extra-Solar Tournament - is a dexterity game in which you move little cardboard tokens around on a hex map. Players take turns to flick discs on their control boards - one for Throttle and one for Manoeuvre thrusters - which determine whether their Mobile Armour executes a perfect slide behind the enemy mecha to deliver a solid shot to the rear or spins wildly in place before careening off in the wrong direction. Players' mecha retain momentum from previous turns' acceleration, and half the challenge is to stay in the arena while being buffeted by cannon fire and homing missiles.&#10;&#10;The use of small control boards means that unlike many dexterity games, MAJESTY doesn't require a large, flat and smooth surface upon which to play.&#10;&#10;",

The best solution was the MegaJail, provided by MegaJail Inc., a maximum security franchise.&#10;&#10;In MegaJail, the players are Wardens proving who is the best at running a wing of a MegaJail in order to secure a lucrative MegaJail contract. Whoever scores the highest Reputation (your score) after a pre-set turn limit wins. Lots of things influence your Rep - you lose it when Cons (prisoners) escape, or get injured, paroled, or other things. The MegaJail Inc. management also dislikes you spending too much cash, so keep an eye on your budget!&#10;&#10;You get Cons in a draft at the beginning of each turn. Then you have a phase with players taking to actions to build new things (like Cells or Facilities). During Lockdown, Cons are put in Cells, which is the major puzzle of the game. Finally News Events happen, Cons may act out, and a new turn is started.&#10;&#10;Just scoring the best isn't enough though - Cons cause Hazards, such as Unrest, Contraband, and ongoing Damage - and Cons can get Angry from overcrowding, high Unrest, or other events. If all the Cons are Angry at the end of the turn, the entire MegaJail melts down, and everybody loses.&#10;&#10;Part puzzle, part jail sim, part campy. Can you be the best Warden and run your own MegaJail?&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The German raid on Astrakhan marks the eastern-most limit of the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union during WWII. What is remarkable is the small number of German units assigned to this sector, just the 16th Motorized Infantry (Greyhound) division, given the frontage and lack of substantial information regarding the Soviet&rsquo;s forces. It was due to this lack of intelligence about the Soviet&rsquo;s intentions and movements that the division&rsquo;s reconnaissance battalion, along with some sympathetic Cossacks, was sent out from Elista on September 13th. The unit&rsquo;s four day raid took them 90 miles beyond the Axis occupied village to the outskirts of Astrakhan during which they destroyed a fuel train, gathered intelligence about the nature of the Soviet&rsquo;s forces, and set off alarms in the region that sent STAVKA scrambling to deal with the threat.&#10;&#10;Greyhound vs. Bear portrays the German raid and Soviet response in a quick playing and easy to learn mini-game. Players use a standard deck of playing cards to activate their units and resolve combats. The game is also easy to play solitaire.&#10;&#10;",

Deep in the heart of this mythical forest lurk angry ogres, giggling goblins, and even the famed and fearsome fire-breathers themselves!&#10;&#10;In Dragonwood, you collect sets of adventurer cards to earn dice, which you then use to roll against your foes. Stomp on some fire ants, scream at a grumpy troll, or strike the menacing orange dragon with a magical silver sword. Choose your strategy carefully because the landscape of Dragonwood is ever-changing. Only the bravest will overcome the odds to emerge victorious!&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;On their turn, players either draw a card or attempt to capture a creature or enhancement.  Players draw from the Adventurer deck that contains cards of 5 different colors all numbered 1-12.  With these cards players form combinations to attempt a Strike (cards in a row of any color), a Stomp (cards of the same number) or a Scream (cards of the same color). To capture, players roll a number of dice equal to the number of cards they have of the particular combination. Each creature has different minimum values of a Strike, Stomp or Scream needed to capture it, and a Victory Point amount.&#10;  &#10;The game includes six, six-sided dice with sides 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, and 4 to reduce extremely lucky outcomes.  The Dragonwood deck has 42 cards, 5 of which are displayed in the landscape at any time.  In addition to creatures, this deck also has enhancements that are captured in the same way as creatures which assist players in capturing creatures, and contains events that also impact play.  When both dragons have been defeated, the game is over and the player with the most victory points wins!&#10;  &#10;Is the best strategy to go for several smaller creatures or save up for larger attacks?  Should you grab some enhancements hoping they will pay off, or go immediately for creatures?  Do you take chances on some rolls or go for sure things?  Every time you play Dragonwood the deck is different, so no two games are the same!&#10;&#10;",

The players take turns to move through town and collecting what's on their current errand. To really master this game you'll have to remember where everything is in town and know where to find it when you need it. Errands is a quick and easy game to learn but quite hard to master.&#10;&#10;For each errand you complete you get a certain score. The first player over a set value (depending on the amount of players playing) is the winner.&#10;&#10;On your way to victory you'll find clipboard cards that will help you or will make it harder for other players to complete their errands.&#10;&#10;The game is perfect for both young and old players. For the youngest players it may be a good way to learn English.&#10;&#10;",

Watch out for the events that will destroy the market and steal your weapons!  Plan your 2 actions per turn well and you will profit from war!  End of game bonuses await you if you are clever enough to sell to the same faction or to all of them.&#10;&#10;The game works very well with 1, 2, 3 or 4 players.

        "description": "Guards of Atlantis: Tabletop MOBA is a competitive team-based board game inspired by computer games of the MOBA genre. In the game, each player controls a single hero and uses a hand of cards to move him around the game board, employ special abilities, and attack enemies. Defeating enemy minions earns you coins, which are used to buy levels and upgrade your hero. Your goal is to help your &quot;minions&quot; &mdash; units that are not directly controlled by the players &mdash; reach the enemy base and capture it.&#10;&#10;Even though Guards of Atlantis can be played with just two players, it's more fun when two teams of players face one another as the game encourages teamwork and tactical play.&#10;&#10;Before the game, every player chooses a hero character to play. Each hero has five cards at the start of the game, with an additional thirteen upgraded versions from which to choose when your hero gains a level. Each card is unique and can be used for a variety of different actions. The character roles are not preset and can evolve on the battlefield to better suit your strategy and counter the opponent's choices. There are no dice to roll, but playing the right card at the right moment is crucial.&#10;&#10;The game begins with players placing their heroes and minions at predefined spots of the game board. The game is split into rounds, with each round consisting of up to four turns. Every player gets to play one card and resolve one action each turn. The cards are played face down, then revealed and resolved in order of initiative values indicated on the cards.&#10;&#10;If at any point a team loses all of their minions in the area, the lane is &quot;pushed&quot;, with all minions on the board moving one area closer to the opponent's base. The game continues, with each team trying to help their minions to move to the enemy base. The first team do this wins!&#10;&#10;",

This means that the game can be played for short periods (e.g. 1/2 hour or a few hours). The winner is the player who has won the most hands at the end.&#10;&#10;The dealer rotates clockwise round the table and after shuffling the cards, starting with their self, deals out seven cards to each player but also finishing with their self, so they will have eight cards. The reason being that they will go first as will every dealer in turn which makes the game fair. The rest of the pack is then put into the centre of the table and the top card is turned over and laid face up on the table next to the pack. If this is a fighter card the player can either then go against that fighter or, choose to go against the next player in turn with the stats and if the card wins that card is laid down on top of the other one for the next player to fight. If the first card down is a magic card it is ignored and they must go against the next player with a fighter card or lay down a magic card and so on.The winner of the hand is the first person (or persons,which it can be with one of the magic cards)to get rid of all their cards.&#10;&#10;The more the game is played the more skilled the players can become, especially with the magic cards,and reading the play ahead.&#10;&#10;",

The leader's abilities alter vastly the strategy and playability of every other card in the deck, making the game playable in 25 different ways.&#10;&#10;In the game, players take turns placing cards and attacking. Each card can activate in various ways, taking on offensive capabilities in the front rows of the unit, or support powers in the back rows. Cards can also be played as orders &ndash; powerful single-time effects that can turn the tide of battle.&#10;&#10;Play continues until either player's leader is defeated. A typical game is best of three or five rounds.&#10;&#10;Pixel Tactics 5 takes place in the same world and uses many of the characters from Level 99 Games' BattleCON: War of Indines, but its gameplay is entirely unrelated.&#10;&#10;This iteration of Pixel Tactics was originally planned to be released as the following Pixel Tactics Deluxe kickstarter promos: &#10;&#10;    Pixel Tactics Black Ops Minipak&#10;    Pixel Tactics: Sealed Secrets Minipak&#10;    Pixel Tactics: The Final Frontier Minipak&#10;&#10;&#10;For ease of distribution these were combined to make Pixel Tactics 5.&#10;&#10;",

To do this, you place a set of cards side by side on the table, with each card featuring a varying number of gems. When signaled, each player simultaneously places a finger on one of the cards. You collect the stones only if you are alone on the card!&#10;&#10;The French version of Crossing includes rules for play with only three whereas the initial Japanese release of Xing included rules only for 4-6 players.&#10;&#10;",

These moustachioed men of science face not only stiff competition from their fellow explorers as they dive (only one man can take credit for discovering each species, after all, and science waits for no one) but also the multitudinous natural dangers and perilous creatures that lurk in the briny deeps.&#10;&#10;As you explore the beautiful hex-based ocean you'll uncover aquatic species ripe for the cataloguing, environmental events both fair and foul, and underhanded shenanigans the unscrupulous can use to tip the balance in their favour (the scallywags!).&#10;&#10;How to Play:&#10;&#10;In All Fathomed Out, the goal is to amass the most impressive collection of previously unknown aquatic species as you possibly can before your competitors beat you to it.  You'd best hurry though, for only the first specimen of a given species is worth academic accolades and can be catalogued; the rest are old news best used for bait!&#10;&#10;Each turn you move across the ocean floor, flipping over new tiles as you venture forth into the unknown or hustling over previously mapped areas on your way back to the ship to drop off your catch or in search of better hunting grounds.  Be careful about wandering too far, though, as the air hose connecting you to the ship and all that sweet, sweet oxygen is only so long and it'd be a real shame if the ship got hit by a sudden typhoon and was sent careening away...&#10;&#10;Exploring a new tile nets you a number of cards (listed on the tile itself) from the game's four decks that could be the specimens you're looking to collect, environmental events that shake the game up, or shenanigans that you can use against other players (or keep for later).  You've only got so much space, though, so at the end of your turn you can only keep two cards.   Choose carefully!&#10;&#10;Once one player catalogues five fish or the ocean is completely explored, the game is over and the player with the most impressive haul (determined by adding together the publication points from each specimen they have catalogued) wins!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Double Mission: Beyond the Object is a light game with a heist movie theme, &agrave; la Ocean's Eleven. It is basically a competitive game, but with a dose of semi-cooperative element.&#10;&#10;Each player personifies a &quot;professional thief&quot; who attempts to retrieve valuable objects (tokens) from various cities of the world. Each city has its own security level, which is represented by the number of dice a player has to roll. The special d6 die has one &quot;fail&quot; side and five &quot;success&quot; sides. For instance, if a player wants to penetrate a level 4 city, he or she rolls four dice and all four dice must show &quot;success&quot; sides.&#10;&#10;There is a unique semi-cooperative aspect here. If a player wants to penetrate a city, he or she can ask another player to join the heist. The main player and the collaborator roll the dice, and the heist succeeds if any one of them rolls all &quot;success&quot;. The main player takes the valuable object from the city while the collaborator receives points for compensation. If the heist fails, both the main player and the collaborator receive an investigation token (potential penalty points).&#10;&#10;Players continue to gather valuable objects, which can be sold for immediate points or displayed to claim &quot;fame titles&quot;.  Whoever earns the most points wins the game and is declared the greatest thief of the world.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, the active player rolls dice and players receive resources based on the die roll and what they've built on the board. The active player can then trade with opponents and build roads, cities and settlements depending on the resources in hand and available space on the board.&#10;&#10;In this travel version of the game, the land spaces aren't individual hexes, but six pieces of material that can be rearranged in different ways to change up the game board. The player pieces and resource cards fit into drawers on the side of the game board, which folds into a trapezoid.&#10;&#10;Catan: Traveler &ndash; Compact Edition includes a two-player variant using cards that allow one player to force a &quot;trade&quot; with the other. When this happens, the first player takes two cards from the opponent, then gives that player any one card in return.&#10;&#10;",

Mighty is played mostly by current or former students in Korea, and it is known there by the English sounding name &quot;Mighty.&quot; It is also played by some groups in North America.&#10;&#10;Mighty is a point-trick game with bidding. In each hand the high bidder chooses a partner by calling a card, and these two players try to take enough of the scoring cards (A, K, Q, J, 10) to fulfill the bid.&#10;&#10;The standard Mighty is played for five players, but there are variant rules for other numbers of players, from three to eight.&#10;&#10;",

The first player to align four of their symbol or color in a row wins the game.&#10;&#10;In more detail, the bricks are effectively two cubes pushed together, with half the brick being orange and the other half blue; when an orange face shows an X, the blue face shows an O and vice versa. Each turn the active player adds one brick to the wall either vertically or horizontally, with each new brick connecting to existing bricks on at least one face and at most eight symbols in a horizontal row. If no one has won by the time that all bricks are in the wall, then on their turn players remove one brick and place it in a new location; if you knock the wall over on your turn, you lose.&#10;&#10;The winning condition can be changed depending on how challenging you want the game to be: (1) Connecting four squares of your color OR four of your symbol; (2) Connecting four squares of your color AND four of your symbol; or (3) Connecting four squares of any color AND four of any symbol.&#10;&#10;",

Each team has a base with a runway and 5 platforms from which aircraft can takeoff and land vertically. In the bases are ammunition depots and anti-aircraft guns. They use training bombs and missiles.&#10;&#10;Each player has a task to achieve as many hits as possible in the enemy bases. Every hit and shot down aircraft counts as one point. The game lasts as long as players have planes and bombs. The winner is the player who has the best ratio of given and received hits.&#10;&#10;The other board (B) is predicted for two players (or two teams - Hot team and Cold team). Cold team has ships with ski jump runways and 5 smaller ships with platforms (concept of small ships where Harriers can takeoff / land). Hot team has platforms and ski jump runways on land. Each team has 12 planes and two transport helicopters. Helicopters carry commandos and if one of them lands in an enemy base - that is the end and victory. In case that nobody manages to do it, the winner is determined the same way as described for the board A - counting caused and received hits.

        "description": "All you have to do is get five objects and bring them home. But then you discover you'll have to navigate waterways and toll roads, and you can't go there without a pass. And you have to figure out the best route to take based on the roll of the die. And while Action cards can help you, they can also help your opponents, and even snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. And you don't think the other players are going to sit idly by and watch you move about unimpeded, do you?&#10;&#10;Got It! is a game that's easy to learn, but tricky to win -- and since the objects you must get change each game, it's never the same twice. But with skillful use of your moves and a little luck, you'll be able to look at the other players with a grin and say &quot;got it&quot;!&#10;&#10;Playing Got It! starts with the deck of Object cards. Each player is dealt five objects, and must roll the die and move around the board to land on the matching spaces. Landing on an object space &quot;gets&quot; the object, but it's not safe until the player gets it back &quot;home&quot; to their starting space. There are specially marked spaces that provide toll passes and boat passes -- a toll pass can get a player from one side of the board to the other quickly, while a boat pass lets players go after objects on the islands. There are also spaces that let players draw &quot;action cards&quot;, some of which are used immediately and others which are held on to and used on later turns. The action cards can provide help (extra moves, extra turns, etc.) or hindrance (lose a pass, lose a turn, etc.). The first player to get all five of their objects home wins.&#10;&#10;",

Throwing at an opponent entails rolling a number of dice equal to how many mana tokens they have. The game has custom dice with hit icons on 2 of the 6 sides. The attacker compares the number of hits they rolled to the defender's catch value. The defender loses health on a hit, or gathers some of the mana that the attacker spent.&#10;&#10;Players need to be careful, as the magic is a bit unstable. At the end of each turn the overload die is rolled. Any player whose number comes up on the overload die has to check how much mana they have.

What will you decide to collect for personal gain? And what are you willing to give up in order to destroy? The Ravens are gathering, many of whom used to be rivals. Will you rise to power or simply be...nevermore.&#10;&#10;Nevermore is a casual-style, card-drafting game in which you quickly build your hand each round, collecting cards you want and poisoning your opponent's hand by passing along cards you think they can't use. Whoever holds the most of a given suit, gains the power of that suit to attack, heal, acquire Light or Shadow magicks and score victory points.&#10;&#10;Will you transform all your rivals into ravens &mdash; or can they regain their human form in time to score enough victory to win?&#10;&#10;&#10;Nevermore can be taught in less than five minutes, yet hides a surprising amount of depth in strategy, as players try to outwit and outmaneuver their opponents. Player &lsquo;transformation&rsquo; replaces player elimination, keeping everyone in the game until the last moment, yet still rewards players who have performed better during the game. That's because a player who has become a Raven cannot win until they can find a way to transform back, but they still play, helping to doom other players and trying to collect one of two specific hands (all of one suit - or - one of every suit) to become human again.&#10;&#10;Short game length encourages multiple plays per session and appeals to players of all skill levels &ndash; with plenty of underhanded plotting and backstabby goodness.&#10;&#10;&#10;Play Overview:&#10;&#10;Players are dealt a hand of 5 cards - but they will not keep them all.&#10;During the drafting phase, players must pass three of those cards to the player on their left. From their new set of five, they must then pass two to the left. Lastly, they will pass one card left - ending the drafting phase with a final drafted hand of five cards. They will have attempted to collect cards from a certain suit (or two) trying to be the player who has the most of that suit this hand - and also carefully managing what they are passing to their opponent, to make sure they don't end up with too powerful a hand.&#10;&#10;During the resolution phase, each suit is called for, one at a time. All players show cards from that suit simultaneously. The player with the most gains the power of the suit - and the strength of the ability is determined by subtracting the second highest total of that suit. Example: I hold three Attack cards. Two other players each hold one Attack card. (3-1=2) I do a 2 point attack on a player I choose. Healing, Victory points and Radiance (which draws a Light Magick card for each you have minus the second highest amount) all work the same way. All but Ravens, who kill cards of other suits in your hand. Example: I have 3 Victory, 1 Attack and 1 Raven. I must choose to sacrifice either 1 Attack or 1 Victory card from my hand as they are Resolved. Certain special hands give additional benefits and/or Victory points.&#10;&#10;If your 5 Health points drop to 0, you become a Raven, still in the game, but unable to win until you can transform back.&#10;&#10;The winner is either the last human player standing - or the first to score 6 Victory points.&#10;&#10;",

To conduct research, you buy an advancement that begins with certain flaws, then you test the advancement to find and eliminate those flaws.  To build a spacecraft, you purchase components and assemble them into a whole. To travel to outer space, you expend rockets to maneuver from one location to another.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Linknotize is the first ever board game to integrate the use of online information and tools into more traditional off-line game play. Linknotize asks players to roll two color-coded dice and then pick two, corresponding color-coded topic cards.  The topic cards are chosen from six subject areas: History, The Arts, Sports, Geography, Entertainment, and Science. By using a device like a smartphone, tablet, SmartTV or computer, the player or team must &ldquo;link&rdquo; the two topics by traveling through the embedded links within an online encyclopedia like Wikipedia. The player or team has three minutes and/or a maximum of ten clicks to &ldquo;link&rdquo; the starting card topic to the destination card topic with the object to accomplish it both the fastest and/or with the fewest number of clicks. The first to combine online search and discovery with offline traditional board game features, Linknotize allows players to capitalize on their general knowledge of a wide variety of cultural and historical topics along with their web browsing skills to connect two topics online while racing the clock.&#10; Linknotize forges a path for a completely innovative category of gaming that juxtaposes technology with more conventional play. The result is the perfect party game that is designed to entertain all audiences. Testing knowledge of categories ranging from pop culture to geography to history to sports, the game is as much about quick thinking as it is about strategically analyzing relationships to link seemingly unrelated topics.&#10;&#10;Playing on the &ldquo;six degrees&rdquo; phenomenon, Linknotize, proves the idea that everyone and everything can be connected. While it may not seem obvious on the surface, our lives are truly a &ldquo;World Wide Web&rdquo; of related concepts, interactions and ideas that lead to common destinations.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

In one game mode, the players co-operate to try to reach Grandma's house before the wolf can spot them; in the second game mode, one player takes on the role of the wolf.&#10;&#10;During the first game mode, the players will help Little Red Riding Hood reach Grandma&rsquo;s cottage before the wolf gets there. In this mode, the wolf is managed by the game. To start, the youngest player flips over the first card of the Path card deck. Count the number of flowers on the card. Place as many face-down Gathering tokens on it as there are flowers. This will be the first card for Gathering. Then, this player takes the first turn of the game as explained below.&#10;&#10;In the second game mode, a player plays the wolf. Unlike the first game mode, the Wolf chooses the Path cards, instead of players drawing them randomly from the deck. The other players play as the characters helping Little Red Riding Hood reach Grandma&rsquo;s cottage before the Wolf arrives.&#10;&#10;",

And the cards are added the number each other.&#10;So if you have 13(Max), you may lose three 5 cards.

On a turn, a player must discard at least two cards from their hand onto one or more discard piles, with cards on the 1 piles being placed in ascending order and cards on the 100 piles being placed in descending order. One tricky aspect of the game is that you can play a card exactly 10 higher/lower than the top card of a discard pile even when you would normally have to play in a descending/ascending order, e.g., if a 100 discard pile is topped with an 87, you can play any card lower than 87 or you can play the 97.&#10;&#10;After a player finishes their turn, they refill their hand from the deck. During play, players cannot reveal exact numbers in their hands, but they can warn others not to play on certain discard piles or otherwise make play suggestions.&#10;&#10;Once the deck is emptied, players are required only to play at least one card on a turn. If you play all 98 cards, you win! If you get good, the rules suggest that you play at least three cards a turn to increase the challenge.&#10;&#10;",

(The second edition of Tr&auml;xx includes a pad of individual score sheets instead of erasable boards.)&#10;&#10;To play, shuffle the deck of fifteen cards, then reveal the top card, which will show four or five colored hexagons. Playing at the same time, each player takes an erasable pen and draws a path on their game board &mdash; with this path starting at or at least passing through the starting point on their board &mdash; that covers up to as many hexagons as were revealed, with the colors of the hexagons in your path matching those shown on the card. Thus, if the card shows two gray hexagons and one each of blue, red and yellow, then your path can cover at most two gray hexagons and one each of blue, red and yellow.&#10;&#10;Once all players have drawn their path, reveal the next card, continuing the path in either direction and covering only as many hexagons of the proper colors as is shown on that card. A path cannot cross itself.&#10;&#10;When your path crosses a number, call out that number. If you're the first one to reach it, you'll score that many points at game end; if others have reached it first, you score half this many points, rounded up. Once you've finished all fifteen cards, the game ends and you lose one point for each space not covered. Whoever has the highest score wins!&#10;&#10;",

To earn this title, you must complete dangerous scenarios in the shortest possible time frame. The most innovative element of the game is that the player uses their own 30-second sand timer as a character to be placed on the ship to perform actions. Each time a player places their own sand timer, they have to wait for the sand to run out to be able to perform the action needed. Each hole in the ship represents an area where you can perform a specific action: turning the ship, loading cannons, shooting enemy ships, repairing damage, and so forth...&#10;&#10;A Tale of Pirates (previously announced as Admiral of the Black) has ten different scenarios, ranging from ordinary pirating activities like looking and shooting, to kraken-hunting, prison breaks, treasure hunts, and much more. An app for any smartphone or tablet will lead the players along the missions, assist with scenario data, random events, multiple paths, upgrades, and gamestate-saving for later sessions. It also serves as a timer for the individual round as the typical scenario lasts 2-3 rounds, each five minutes long.&#10;&#10;The players have to react to events and maneuver the ship to fight enemy gunboats, catch rich merchant vessels, and avoid other obstacles. They must communicate to agree and organize things to do, but they have to be quick because time is always ticking.&#10;&#10;A Tale of Pirates is swift playing with simple rules, but it's exciting and involving, with great interactions among players. Unlike some other real time coop games the stress is present but not dominating. The thirty-second delays, in addition to the intermittent rounds, always allow you to catch your breath!&#10;&#10;",

Each Emporium earns the player the special benefits of the space where it's built, but also activates all connected emporiums in a chain effect.&#10;&#10;- Corrupt the Emperor&rsquo;s council to allow a player to build Emporiums without permission cards.&#10;&#10;- Players can change the composition of a council.&#10;There are many different ways to earn points:&#10;&#10;- Build a connected Emporium in the cities that award points.&#10;&#10;- Build your emporium in all the cities of an area of the board: the faster you complete the area, the more points you earn.&#10;&#10;- Move up on the nobility&rsquo;s track.&#10;&#10;Obtain permits that give points.&#10;Moreover, the board is modular and has eight possible combinations.&#10;&#10;",

The battles, included in the scenario booklet, focus on the historical deployment of forces and important terrain features of trench fighting in scale with the game system. The scale of the game is flexible and varies from battle to battle. For some scenarios, a few infantry units may represent an entire wing of a larger battle, while in other scenarios a unit may represent just a few brave soldiers going over the top.&#10;&#10;The Command card system drives movement, creates a &quot;fog of war&quot;, and presents players with many interesting opportunities, while the battle dice resolve combat quickly and efficiently. The Combat cards add an element of suspense and will challenge players to coordinate their use in a timely manner. Overall, the battlefield tactics players will need to execute to gain victory conform remarkably well to the strengths and limitations of the various types of WWI units, their weapons, battlefield terrain, and written history.&#10;&#10;In this core game, the main focus is on a number of WWI trench warfare battles. However, a series of expansions, which will feature early war, Eastern Front scenarios, tanks, airplanes, other national armies, plus more special personnel figures, are already in the planning stage to enhance your WWI gaming experience.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "You are an apprentice sorcerer in this new CCG. But can you master the elements when put to the test? So begins your Quest for Arete!&#10;&#10;Quest for Arete (Are-a-Tay) is an Elemental card game of sorcery and duels.  This beautifully illustrated game is suitable for players age 12 and up. The game is designed to be simple to learn, but with multiple layers of complexity that may be added based on player experience and ability. In the game, each player is a sorcerer&rsquo;s apprentice charged by their master to make their way in the world seeking to increase their Arete &ndash; or excellence.&#10;&#10;The back story of the game sets it in the pre-history of modern chemistry when magicians and sorcerers were actually trained in the undiscovered properties of the natural elements.&#10;&#10;As an apprentice, you must duel any other sorcerer you meet using magical elements (represented by the cards) that combine make potions and spells. Each duel, won or lost, increases your experience and understanding of the elements and therefore, increases your Arete.&#10;&#10;With additional rules applied, the challenge increases as players contemplate element stacking, spell interactions, time constraints, character cards and special character abilities.  Decks are custom built by the player to suite their style of play and the strengths of their chosen character.&#10;&#10;The game is available in a Starter Set that contains everything needed for two players. The kit includes 2 play mats, a full-color 24-page rule book, a timer, 4 character cards, two starter decks (identical) and two expansion decks (unique).&#10;&#10;Once they learn the basics using their starter decks, the players can duel for first draw from Expansion Deck A. Each player chooses 5 new elements and customizes their deck. They may then duel again for first pick until Expansion A is depleted. As they repeat this process with Expansion B, their decks become more and more different - focusing on their unique preferences and character strengths.&#10;&#10;Did they choose wisely? Have they mastered the elements and gained Arete?&#10;&#10;Can you do better?&#10;&#10;Quest for Arete can range from a simple game to high levels of complexity that will satisfy even the most avid gamer!&#10;&#10;To locate a Quest for Arete  distributor or retailer near you, visit www.QuestForArete.com&#10;&#10;",

In one move player rolls two dices, black determines how many fields one figurine moves and white for how many fields moves the ball. The ball can be moved only if a figurine of a player is next to it. When figurine player is moving  - it can push the ball with it. At the end of its movement ball can be 'shot' to another own figurine or into the net. When the ball figurine enters the 'goal' that is score. The opponent puts the ball on the center of the board and begins new action. Players agree on how long the game lasts.&#10;&#10;",

The winner is the player who gave more hits, but the game can end differently - if a player manages to make a landing.

Each unit can only capture units that are as strong as it or weaker, except that some units can &quot;trump&quot; stronger units: a trebuchet is the only unit that can kill a dragon. Many units have unique powers, like the ability to move twice or to attack from a distance.&#10;&#10;",

Players take turns placing a card from their hand in a row on the table. After placing the card, the player reveals the date on it. If the card was placed correctly with the date in chronological order with all other cards on the table, the card stays in place; otherwise the card is removed from play and the player takes another card from the deck.&#10;&#10;The first player to get rid of all his cards by placing them correctly wins. If multiple players go out in the same round, then everyone else is eliminated from play and each of those players are dealt one more card for another round of play. If only one player has no cards after a bonus round, he wins; otherwise play continues until a single player goes out.&#10;&#10;Timeline Challenge incorporates the original mechanic of the series into progressive game track, of which players can move between 0-4 spaces per turn.  Players will have to make use of pre-determined time periods and guess where the incident depicted on the card occurred.  There are four different challenges, and they are played depending on the color of the game space of the lead player.  Additionally there are two further challenges which allow the two players at the back of the pack to catch up.  Although the game comes with its own cards, it can be integrated with any or all of the previous sets.&#10;&#10;",

Players can choose to Attack (with a weapon and a gauntlet), Defend (with a weapon or a shield), Jostle/Disarm (with a Gauntlet) or Regather (where a player only feigns to roll dice, allowing them to return dice rolled on previous turns to their hand).&#10;&#10;The dice results are compared and players may retrieve only one of their rolled dice, the rest are &quot;placed with their squire&quot;.&#10;&#10;The game can be played using optional Knight and Items cards that introduce variable player powers and greater tactical depth.&#10;&#10;",

Each player controls one airport with its ATC (Air Traffic Controllers) and try to take off and land as many planes as possible.&#10;&#10;Each player receives one board at the start of the game. The board represents an airport that is controlled by the player and it is divided into five Zones and seven spaces for Action cards. The Zones are used as an areas to place ATC and Plane cards and the other spaces are destined for corresponding Action cards (Airport, Upgrade, Event and Weather).&#10;&#10;The key element of the game is moving the Planes between the Zones and players. The Planes are moved by sending them ATC commands. To send a command to a Plane, a player must pay with ATC points, which is done by removing a number of counters from ATC cards. Moving Planes provides victory points which are needed to win the game.&#10;&#10;",

Each of the other players turn in a gray card that fills in the blank and completes the fact. The person giving the most outrageous card wins the round.&#10;&#10;The dice symbol represents whichever name came up on the dice.  Where it gets even more interesting: if you roll a &quot;WTF&quot;, the card is up for grabs! The symbol then represents YOUR OWN NAME and the first person to post the phrase online gets the point.

Because if you're satyr dies, your chance of winning the war dies with him.&#10;&#10;Players roll dice to move around a track, through different regions of the board, and attack the other player by again rolling dice and comparing to a combat resolution chart to modify the rolls.&#10;&#10;",

You will pilot the K-Machines, ancient yet technologically advanced fighting mecha that can combine to form Final Kaiser, champion of justice. You will do battle against shapeshifting mechanical monsters called Robeasts, gigantic foot soldiers of the starfaring artificial intelligence FANGER. Your only way to defeat these terrors is to use the Final Attack, an all-powerful weapon that takes the entire game to charge.&#10;&#10;Final Attack! is a unique blend of card game, worker placement game, social game, and arcade game. You will play cards, you will move chips around the table, you will solve resource puzzles, you will yell attack names, and you will endure hardship by yourself or with whatever companions fate has provided, all in real time. The game takes between 20 and 30 minutes to play, and there is absolutely nothing else like it.&#10;&#10;",

And it has never needed a screen or batteries.&#10;&#10;Now it's your turn to roll your very own story with Story Time Dice! Suitable for all ages and any number of players, these seven big, chunky polyhedral dice come in a variety of fun shapes, and with a quick roll will help you spin a million grand tales. Pit 12 heroes against 10 villains in 6 settings, using 20 tools and 8 vehicles to overcome 6 obstacles and claim 6 prizes! Can you create an adventure in which a lost diver thwarts a robot in a haunted house using music and a time warp to collect a valuable treasure? It's all up to the dice, and your imagination!&#10;&#10;This Story Time Dice set includes:&#10;3 six-sided dice with settings, obstacles and prizes&#10;1 eight-sided vehicles die&#10;1 ten-sided villains die&#10;1 twelve-sided heroes die&#10;1 twenty-sided tools die&#10;1 guide to every icon on the dice&#10;4 recommended games to play: Once Upon a Time, One by One, Heroes &amp; Villains (see below), and Rescue Operation&#10;&#10;Once Upon a Time and One by One are different styles of storytelling.&#10;&#10;Rescue Operation&#10;Have each player roll the hero die and the vehicle or tool dice to determine his/her character and their abilities. When all players have finished, one player rolls the villain, obstacle and setting dice and uses them to create a sticky situation for their character. The other players then must use their characters' abilities and teamwork to create a story in which they rescue their friend. The captured character can make their job more difficult by rolling more obstacles and villains into the story!&#10;&#10;Heroes &amp; Villains&#10;One player rolls the hero die to create a character, then rolls the tool die three times and the vehicle die once to create their character's arsenal. The other player does the same, using the villain dice instead of the hero. The villain begins the story by using their character and arsenal to turn the situation against the hero. The hero then continues the story by trying to beat the villain. Players continue taking turns. The game is over when one player can't image how they could possibly win!&#10;&#10;",

These cards are put face down.&#10;Then pass rest of the cards to the left.&#10;Then players decide which card that is in between will they look at...&#10;&#10;You have the game and the rules in the files section, so just take a look ;)&#10;&#10;",

One player takes on the role of the Hero, exploring the twisting halls and deadly chambers of the labyrinth. Another player takes on the role of the Dungeon Lord, summoning monstrous creatures and wielding dark magic.&#10;&#10;The adventure is brought to life through an array of cards and dice. As players explore the dungeon, Store Cards describe the rooms and challenges the Hero will face. When a battle erupts or a trap is sprung, Challenge Dice are rolled to see who is victorious.&#10;&#10;The adventure culminates in an epic battle between the Hero and the Dungeon Lord with only one player left standing.&#10;&#10;The Kickstarter Edition of the game includes 50 additional story cards plus new heroes (Adren the Knight, Cael Oathbringer the Priest, and Rivern the Huntress) and new dungeon lord characters (Norathra the Forsaken, Spider Queen, and Sythean the Devourer).&#10;&#10;Specifically this includes:&#10;&#10;&#10;     50 Story Cards&#10;     3 Advanced Hero Character Cards&#10;     3 Advanced Dungeon Lord Character Cards&#10;     23 Creature Cards&#10;     27 Hero Skill cards&#10;     4 Basic Equipment cards&#10;     13 Treasure cards&#10;     30 Power cards (Hero)&#10;     30 Power cards (Dungeon Lord)&#10;     8 Omen cards&#10;     42 Final Battle cards&#10;     3 Sythean Creature cards&#10;     6 Sythean Critical cards&#10;     3 Cael Rune cards&#10;     12 Cael Rune tokens&#10;     4 Norathra Blood Vine tokens&#10;     1 Rivern Mark token&#10;     1 Blood token&#10;     2 Adren Shield tokens&#10;     1 Spider Queen Web card&#10;     10 Spider Queen Web tokens&#10;&#10;&#10;",

In 2085 A.D., armored warfare continues - faster and deadlier than ever. Hovercraft, tanks and infantry slug it out with tactical nuclear devices. But the most feared weapon of all needs no human guidance. It's a giant cybernetic tank called the OGRE.&#10;&#10;The basic OGRE game gives one player a force of infantry and armor, and a command post he must defend. The other player has only one unit - but it's an OGRE. It's an even match. Advanced games allow solitaire or multi-player action, with OGREs on both sides.&#10;&#10;In G.E.V., units from Ogre are carried over, with expanded rules for terrain. A larger map and more ambitious game.&#10;&#10;",

Have you or your family ever seen a spook, spectre, or ghost? If the answer is &quot;yes&quot;, then don't wait another minute. Pick up the phone and call the professionals!&#10;&#10;Ghostbusters: The Board Game is an episodic adventure game for one to four players, who are charged with busting ghosts and sealing gates to the Spirit World. In the game, players choose one of the four Ghostbusters character figures &mdash; Peter Venkman, Egon Spengler, Winston Zeddemore and Ray Stantz &mdash; then select one of the game's pre-written scenarios, beginning a game session that lasts from 30 minutes to two hours, depending on the chosen scenario(s) and degree of difficulty. Each of the Ghostbusters has unique traits and talents that can assist the entire team, with highly co-operative gameplay. As players gain experience from banishing spirits, the Ghostbusters level up, gaining new abilities that help them take on greater challenges. The team can also hop in the Ecto-1, the Ghostbusters' converted ambulance, to help them quickly move through the city.&#10;&#10;Ghostbusters: The Board Game comes with more than forty plastic figures, including the four Ghostbusters, Slimer, Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, Indulnas, and numerous Galloping Ghouls, Gruesome Twosomes and Boogaloo. The game board is created with double-sided modular pieces, increasing the game's replayability for scenarios and customization.&#10;&#10;",

Lang.&#10;&#10;In this game, each player fields one of the superhero teams, with each hero &mdash; Batman, Wonder Woman, Hal Jordan, Mogo, Superboy Prime, Sinestro and more &mdash; being represented by custom-tooled dice; each team must be composed of 15 dice, and a player can &quot;purchase&quot; dice only from his team. Each hero also has one or more character reference cards, which show the special abilities for the characters based on the die rolls. Different versions of these cards are available in booster packs, allowing for more customization of your team. Players use these dice to collect energy, recruit new heroes, and battle head-to-head. In addition, each player brings two basic action cards to the game, which are placed in the center of the table; both players can purchase these cards. A player wins once the opposing player has been reduced to zero life.&#10;&#10;DC Comics Dice Masters: War of Light debuts both the Teen Titans and new Lantern Corps never before seen in Dice Masters! With gameplay that supports two players in epic dice battles, DC Comics Dice Masters: War of Light lets players build their own team of heroes or villains!&#10;&#10;",

The game is played in three rounds &mdash; Morning News, News at Noon and Evening Edition &mdash; in which the players take turns making up news stories, using elements from the previous rounds, as well as bringing new items in. They have to think on their feet and adapt their news stories to different newscaster roles.&#10;&#10;Each round, the players need to adapt the story elements they are given to the news segment they have been assigned. Being assigned a segment helps players build a starting story and in future rounds causes stories to blend and change in interesting ways.&#10;&#10;The three recursive rounds are at the core of the experience. Seeing the same news item start out as a relatively simple Home and Beauty segment, then in Sportsball a bit more odd and unbelievable, and finally as a Political where the hilarious chaos peaks adds to the zany nature of the recursion.&#10;&#10;",

The Fox makes the first move.  Both he and the Hunter can only move along the lines.  Both Fox and Hunter alternate turns moving only one space at a time.  The Hunter tries to force the Fox into a position where the Hunter's next move would be into the same hole the Fox is in.  When the Hunter reaches this position he rolls the dice.  If he rolls an even number, he has netted the Fox.  If he rolls an odd number the Fox may take two moves and thus gets away.  The game continues until the Hunter again corners the Fox.  At this time the Hunter again rolls the dice.  If an even number is rolled the Hunter wins, but if an odd number is rolled the Fox has eluded the Hunter for the second time, and the Fox is the winner.&#10;&#10;",
