While primarily a solitaire game, the special edition also contains optional two player rules.&#10;&#10;The player controls the German forces and must battle the Russian Army to control as many regions of Stalingrad as possible. The game is played by deploying German units on a map of Stalingrad. The AI (or an optional second player) controls the Russian forces through movement, placement, and attack rules.&#10;&#10;The game plays out over 15 turns (although shorter scenarios are provided). Each turn, the player will place Russian forces in the Ferry areas on the Volga River (these units are placed upside down and are not revealed until attacked). The German player will then raise troops and move units to instigate combat. The AI rules then dictate how the Russian units will counter attack and conduct movement.&#10;&#10;Victory is determined by controlling all the Urban areas of Stalingrad at the end of a turn. The game can end early if the player achieves the victory conditions before the end of turn 15. If the player doesn't control the Urban areas by the end of the game, it is a loss.&#10;&#10;",

By placing their sellers, creating buzz, and managing their promotional efforts correctly, they can turn a profit and get board game geeks excited about their games. Each player board is themed as a certain type of game publisher (eurogames, ameritrash, war games, RPGs) with the reverse side showing other possibilities (abstract, children's games, party games, LARP).&#10;&#10;ESSEN is a game for 2-4 players, and by combining two copies of the game up to 8 players can play at the same time.&#10;&#10;",

The self-destruction mechanism has been triggered and players only have 5 minutes to kill the aliens blocking their way to the emergency exit hatch.&#10;&#10;Players are dealt six face-down alien cards showing the hit pattern to complete in order to kill the alien. The hit patterns consist in 4 or 5 dice in various colors and values. When the game starts, a timer is triggered, all players flip the first card in their deck, and then simultaneously roll dice as fast as they can, in order to complete the hit patterns lying in front of them. Once a pattern is complete, the player flips the next card and starts rolling dice again to complete the new pattern revealed. Dice can (and in some cases must) be passed between players to complete their patterns.&#10;&#10;If all players manage to complete all the patterns they were dealt at the beginning of the game, they reach the escape pod safely and leave the space station unharmed. However, if the timer reaches zero before all patterns are completes, the space station explodes with aliens and humans aboard, and everyone lose.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Ascension: Realms Unraveled is a deck-building game in which players acquire cards from a central pool, then place those cards in their discard pile to be shuffled into their deck for later use; creatures also show up in that shared card pool, and players can combat them to earn victory points (VPs) and possibly other benefits, such as the ability to remove less useful cards from their deck or to banish cards from the pool that others might find useful. The game ends once all the available VPs have been claimed or the shared deck of cards runs out.&#10;&#10;Ascension: Realms Unraveled, part of the Ascension deck-building game series, is both a standalone game for 2-4 players (with solitaire rules included, too) and an expansion that can be combined with any other Ascension game to support up to six players.&#10;&#10;While cards in previous Ascension games have always belonged to one of four factions, Ascension: Realms Unraveled introduces multi-faction heroes, and these heroes combine with the new &quot;Multi-Unite&quot; game mechanism to deliver huge rewards to those who play multiple heroes from the same faction.&#10;&#10;Ascension: Realms Unraveled also features the &quot;Transform&quot; mechanism that debuted Ascension: Darkness Unleashed, with players being able to convert their cards into new, more powerful versions as the game progresses.&#10;&#10;",

Players can race from one end to the opposite end or they can start at opposite ends and attempt to find each other. Players can also &quot;duel&quot; by first collecting power points so that when they meet-up the one with the most power wins.&#10;&#10;Players play the MazeScroll games using a pen, pencil or colored pencils. When the game is done, the finished MazeScroll becomes a piece of artwork that is also a record of their play.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Pocket Odyssey is a micro dungeon crawling game inspired by traditional table top RPG games. It takes place in the Dungeonfell, also known as the buried plane, with all but one player acting as a group of adventurers on a quest. The quest is created by the last player, known as the storyteller, who must create a set of challenges based off of quest cards randomly drawn at the start of the game.&#10;&#10;The game concept can be described as putting the spirit of a traditional pen and paper RPG into a micro table top game. Players pick a character background card (ex:  Ogre Slayer, Swindler King, etc.) and add special power cards to them (ex: Fireball, Backstab, etc.) they then draw a Flaw card which gives them a unique attribute (ex: chronic liar, Impatient, etc.) and a personal goal card (in secret) which they must complete in addition to the main quest to win the game (ex:  Outsmart an enemy, Betray a party member, etc.).&#10;&#10;During combat the game is played on modular map cards with heroes and monsters acting in sequence; the storyteller controls all the monsters. Heroes obtain loot cards at the end of combat in addition to leveling their characters stats. To win the game, each player must complete the main quest developed by the storyteller (through the use of the quest cards) as well as their own personal quest cards (which are kept hidden until completed).&#10;&#10;",

Once you get a run you put it down, but to keep it in play, you have to answer a question related to the birds in the run. You could skip this part for younger players. With the questions, it makes it an educational game. It is easy to teach and learn. There are also joker cards counting as any card. You score points for the amount of runs you have down. You also score negative points for the cards in your hand once the game ends. The worst card to end up with in your hand is a joker, losing you 50 points. The winner is the one with the most points.&#10;&#10;",

When opponents land on players owned property, the owning player collects rent from the landing player.

The ultimate goal is to have the most money and drive opponents into bankruptcy.&#10;&#10;The classic Monopoly with constructions and other elements from the Erzgebirge, an area in the south of Saxony.&#10;&#10;",

The main difference is that the Polish version supports the game from 2 to 5 players, while Eleminis is playable up to 8 players. There is also a smaller variety of action cards.&#10;&#10;Moreover the theme is completely new. Superbohaterowie in Polish language means Superheroes.&#10;&#10;Your goal in this game is to collect one of each of five superheroes in your city on the table. Players each have five slots available to them, and each slot can hold one card. On a turn, you draw a card from the deck then either play it in a row (if it's a superhero card) or use it (if it's an action).&#10;&#10;Each superhero outranks two other superheros, similar to rock/paper/scissors/Spock/lizard. You can play a superhero card you draw in any empty space or replace a weaker superhero with the new one; you can play in your row or an opponent's. A star superhero is wild and can represent any superhero you need; a giant spider card can replace any element and can be displaced only by a star superhero or an action card.&#10;&#10;The actions let you discard cards in play, move cards, swap them. There are no cards which let you to lose your turn or reverse the turn order (which are in the Eleminis). Play continues until someone collects one superhero of each type in his city.&#10;&#10;",

Once cards are energized in the matrix players can use their unique actions to shape their victory. The player with the most actual energy at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Symetra has many different play modes including short and long games, teams, draft, tournament, solitaire and oracle.&#10;&#10;Symetra includes 60 unique hexagon-shaped cards, 300 glass beads (6 different coloured sets of 50 beads each) and a detailed rulebook.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Destruction of Force Z is a tactical level, solitaire simulation of the short air/naval campaign off the coast of Malaya in late 1941 which saw the destruction of two Royal Navy capital ships, HMS Prince of Wales and HMS Repulse by Japanese bombers. The player takes the British side, and the game system plays the Japanese side.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is for the British to disrupt Japanese invasions taking place, while not losing his ships. You as the player are presented with a difficult situation. Pearl Harbor has just been attacked; the entire Malayan peninsula is under threat of invasion. There are not many offensive options open to you and your ships, but doing something to take the war to the enemy is preferable to meekly doing nothing at all. Perhaps you can disrupt invasion sites? Intercept enemy warships? Whatever you decide, it will be an uphill battle for the British. In the actual campaign, Force Z sailed out of Singapore into the South China Sea in the early evening of December 8. Admiral Phillips, onboard the Prince of Wales, ordered strict radio silence. If the two British capital ships were able to reach the Gulf of Siam undetected, they might be able to wreak havoc among enemy warships, transports, and invasion sites. If they were found, they risked the wrath of land-based Japanese bombers located in Indo-China. But danger from this eventuality was judged to be minimal, even though the RAF had warned the Admiral that they could not guarantee protection of the ships from the air.&#10;&#10;The stage is set, the campaign is about to begin. Can you pull off a British victory, and avoid the destruction of Force Z?&#10;&#10;The game includes:&#10;&#10;     an illustrated 12-page digest-sized rule booklet that includes all rules and tables necessary for play, &#10;     a small map and &#10;     set of 59 counters (which must be printed and separated before play, depending on version), &#10;     Reference Card, and &#10;     optional ship counters for a game variant, originally published in Panzerschreck #16 (2014). &#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher for 2018 edition&#10;&#10;",

You have to take a Move act next round.&#10;&#10;Attack: Attack the opponent in your position, if he ends round here and doesn&rsquo;t take an attack action, you win. You have to take a Move act next round.&#10;&#10;Pursuit: Move and attack the opponent. You have to stay in the new grid without any actions next round.(3 uses only for each player)&#10;&#10;For each Move round a player may also take a Challenge, declare his current position and earn points. In a series of consecutive challenges, it&rsquo;s 1 point for the first challenge, 2 points for the second, 4 points for the third, 8 points for the fourth and later ones. After 20 rounds without a successful attack, the player has the most points win the game.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "A Straight Road is a car racing game set in a post-apocalyptic future. Inspired by the countless movies of that genre, you race down a long (it almost seems endless) straight, ever-changing highway, trying to kill off all your competitors, run over the most valuable pedestrians, reach the gas station first or a variety of other goals, depending on the scenario you pick. Sometimes you will be on your own, sometimes you will be part of a gang.&#10;&#10;There are many cars, drivers, passengers and equipment available that can be combined freely to build the wheeled killing machine of your dreams. However, the scenario only grants you a certain amount of credit to do so, each car only has a limited load capacity and, of course, the better the gear and the driver, the more expensive.&#10;&#10;Game play is simple and fast. Each turn you change your speed, drive and take an action. You attack your opponents with your mounted guns, molotovs, rockets and more, lay mines or leave oil puddles for the guys behind you to slip in, ram other cars and wracks out of your way. Your ability to do stuff changes, depending on how fast you are going and what you are trying to do. However, only in very few cases you will need to calculate anything, most of that is taken care of by the layout of the game material; You just check your current value and roll a six-sided die. While you will want to stay on the road, circumstances often will force you to drive on the shoulder, where going gets rougher and steering more interesting&hellip;&#10;&#10;Most of the game is free to print and play, you will, however, need small models to represent your cars; Micromachines work well, or any other model of roughly that size. If you deem Thunder Road too simplistic and Car Wars too fiddly, this might be a game for you.&#10;&#10;",

Civilizations discover new technology and expand over the planet; they trade with more developed neighbors to import new technologies or exploit the land to have more power for future actions. Civilizations develop their military and wage wars with each other. They build wonders to make their civilization stand above others and to eventually attract tourists and newcomers to their land to follow their leaders and use their national advisors.&#10;&#10;Historia is a civilization game for 1-6 players that takes 25 minutes per player. A set of action cards is available to the players to guide their civilization, and used actions form a discard queue from which they are taken back into a player's hand during the game. Wars and raids are carried out in a non-disruptive way. When modern times have been reached the game ends and the player with the most VPs wins.&#10;&#10;A solo Historia variant with A.I. bots is also available.&#10;&#10;Flavor text:&#10;History is made by strong leaders and wise advisors, by conquests and discoveries, by wars and trade and amazing wonders. Historia is made by you.&#10;&#10;",

But, the virus must overcome the body's natural defenses as well as competing for dominance with the other viruses.&#10;&#10;Probes arrive in any of the six origin spaces and begin to take over the host's body.

Players control an organization with the resources and intent to explore, develop, and colonize the worlds beyond Earth. Organizations that practice careful planning and resource management, with a healthy dose of technology research will succeed. Destination: Neptune moves through four generations of space exploration. Players earn Victory Points by building large commercial outposts and colonies, as well as from fame and outright purchases. After four generations, the player with the most Victory Points wins the game.&#10;&#10;This is a card driven game in which most Cards have an action that happens immediately, and another action for all of the players (including the player who played the card). Players can also sell cards in exchange for currency. When you sell a card, it goes to an Opportunity Track and is placed to the side of the board. If the Opportunity Track already has as many cards as players, the rightmost card is discarded. You may not change the order of the cards in the Opportunity Track. Players can play cards from the Opportunity Track as if they were in their hands.&#10;&#10;Players must use the cards to gain currency and fuel in order to launch space missions to establish bases, factories and colonies on various locations within our solar system. Careful hand and resource management is key to winning the game. In addition, players also need to research certain technologies in order to build on most locations. Technologies are researched through card play and paying currency. The cards are separated into 4 piles which are separate generations. At the end of each generation, each player scores points for the various structures they've built. The game ends when all generation piles have been exhausted.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Each player represents a royal family that is attempting to influence the King or the Queen of an Ancient Kingdom in order to gain the royal favor that will make you become the next most powerfull family in the land.&#10;&#10;In order to achieve the goal the players will have 10 (Ten) Archetypes they will use to surround the Royal Consort of their color with as much influence as possible.&#10;&#10;The player who uses with cunning the resources at his/her disposal will be the winner.&#10;&#10;&#10;SETUP&#10;&#10;Each player will place his/her 10 tiles with the ACTIVE (This is the side with the banner) side up in his/her Activation Zone (Area close to the player where all the archetypes will enter play or return from play)&#10;&#10;Place the king and the queen in the middle ground between the players in the same row with 2 spaces between them.&#10;&#10;The game will be played in an imaginary grid with each space the size of one tile.&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY&#10;&#10;Flip a coin, roll a die, find your method of convenience to choose a first player.&#10;&#10;The game will be played in turns one player at a time. On your turn you must do the following actions:&#10;&#10;1) PLAY A TILE from your Activation Area.&#10;&#10;The first tile played by each player WILL NOT ACTIVATE ITS ABILITY. So it is very important you choose well which of your archetypes wont be used in the beginning of the game.&#10;&#10;A tile played must always be adjacent to another tile (even diagonally) So you cannot place a tile anywhere in the imaginary grid.&#10;&#10;A tile played always enters the game on the side it was in the Activation Area. So if the tile played was ACTIVE it stays with the side of the banner up and if the tile was INACTIVE it stays with the side that has a token drawn.&#10;&#10;Consider INACTIVE tiles as protected from abilities when they are in PLAY since abilities cannot target INACTIVE tiles. It&acute;s a very good strategy to keep this in mind because an opponent won&acute;t be able to affect one of your INACTIVE tiles.&#10;&#10;2) ACTIVE its ability (if possible)&#10;&#10;Tiles that have been affected by an ability are turned to the INACTIVE SIDE (the one with the token on it). Same happens with the King and Queen.&#10;&#10;Abilities cannot affect tiles that are in play with the INACTIVE SIDE up. This means that once a tile has been turned to the INACTIVE SIDE it&acute;s safe on the board. It can be moved as usual by its owner but will not altered by an opponent.&#10;&#10;&#10;3) MOVE ONE OF YOUR TILES IN PLAY ONE SPACE (diagonally or perpendicularly)&#10;&#10;Notice that the joker has a special ability that allows you to move ONE MORE TIME after you placed it. This is a very strategical ability that can make big difference when you are trying to reposition a high influence tile on your turn or when you want to remove an opponent tile as well. Under no circumstance a tile can end up or move over another tile in the table.&#10;&#10;When you move a tile it must always end adjacent to another tile. So you cannot move it on empty space unless it ended there due to the movement of the other tiles.&#10;&#10;&#10;END GAME &amp; WINNING CONDITIONS&#10;&#10;The game will end when one of this two conditions happen:&#10;&#10;1) One player starts his/her turn with his target consort surrounded by his own tiles  (perpendicularly).&#10;&#10;The victory is total. The more you play the less this condition is going to happen.&#10;&#10;2) The players have played all of their tiles.&#10;&#10;Once the players have played all of their tiles comes the scoring. For this step only the tiles that surround PERSPERNDICULARLY (up, down and sides) each royal consort will count. Add all the influence numbers in the tiles, PLUS all the tokens if there are INACTIVE tiles among them (each one is worth 1 point) MINUS the total influence on the tiles your opponent has surrounding your royal consort. Compare this numbers... the player with the most influence WINS the game. In case of a tie... you are both too smart to outwit each other :)&#10;&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS&#10;&#10;20 double sided tiles&#10;1 king&#10;1 queen&#10;&#10;",

Five cards are dealt to each player, with one being face-up. Only four tricks are played in each hand.&#10;&#10;Each trick captured counts 1 point, and each Queen and Deuce counts 1 point.

In this game's predecessor, Typo from 2004, players placed letter cards in four separate rows; in Typo 2D, players can build &quot;words&quot; in two directions, crossing words as in crossword puzzles. The first player to play all of his cards wins.&#10;&#10;In each game round, all players choose one of their hand cards, then reveal them simultaneously. In alphabetical order, players place their card adjacent to a card on the table to create or extend a row or column of letters. You must then say a word that starts with the letters in this row or column. If you extend a row and a column at the same time, you must say a word for the row and a word for the column. Once five or more rows/columns consist of at least two connected cards, you may place a letter only if you extend the length of a row or column to three cards or more.&#10;&#10;If you cannot place a letter card because you can't create a word, then you must remove all cards from the longest row or column and add half of these cards to your hand. (Set the other cards aside as a penalty pile.) If you still can't place a letter in order to create a word, you must remove another word, etc.&#10;&#10;If you place a letter card and connect separate areas of the grid &mdash; which were separated due to someone needing to remove a word &mdash; then you discard one of your penalty cards.&#10;&#10;Typo 2D includes icons on some cards that can be used for variants, such as a card that can replace another card or a card you must place behind an empty spot and &quot;fill in&quot; the empty spot by saying a word.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Hounds of War Mk. II is a update to the original standardized skirmishing miniatures rules system which allows the players (with maximum flexibility during the CREATION phase) to be able to take ANY 25-30mm figures, assign them the game values the players WANT, and be able to bring them into play. With Hounds of War Mk. II you will be able to pit World War II Nazi Storm Troopers against your favorite Goblin Hoards, or even Star Wars&copy; Storm Troopers!&#10;&#10;This is a stand-alone set of rules, so no other rules are necessary for play. In addition,  you WILL need your own miniatures, a LOT of 10-sided dice (d10), marking chits, 3D terrain, rulers marked in inches, and your imagination to play this game.&#10;&#10;Instead of being a &quot;you-go-I-go&quot; turn sequence, an initiative deck is used  and cards assigned to individual units to determine when units perform actions are performed in a turn. This creates a fast paced game in which players are constantly active.&#10;&#10;Hounds of War Mk. II is the culmination of many post convention evaluations, fan suggestions, and clarifications. Inside you will find many clarified and expanded rules, as well as prebuilt armies, a campaign system suggestion, a victory point system, counter sheets, and much more. We thank all of you who have taken an active part in the growth of this system.&#10;&#10;",

Seven scenarios give you the opportunity to explore the desperate fighting in the Eisenbach Gap and Gerzenburg.  Dawn's Early Light: Red Hammer is the 2nd expanded edition of Dawn's Early Light and now includes the High Noon at Gerzenberg expansion from Line of Fire magazine #10. Dawn's Early Light Red Hammer is set in a hypothetical 1985 as World War 3 starts.  The game uses variable initiative, support element chit pulls, and a novel combat resolution mechanic to create a game modeling the lethality of the modern battlefield with a minimum of rules overhead.&#10;&#10;Dawn's Early Light Red Hammer has been refined, corrected, and polished.  This edition has updated game manual, counters, player aid card and map.  The game map is now printed on a heavy paper stock in vibrant color and also includes a newly designed full-color box.  Players can control forces of America, Canada, West Germany and the Soviet Union.&#10;&#10;Dawn's Early Light Red Hammer is easy to learn and play in an evening, so get ready to play.&#10;&#10;",

The goal is simple: earn yourself 10 Bed Notches while avoiding the consequences of your actions such as lost turns, Clingy Exes, STDs, and babies. The dialogue is both horrible and hilarious. Play is quick as everyone has the ability to play cards on another person's turn. A player will have seven cards in their hand and can GETSOME, become PREGGOS, gain a Status Effect, heal a Status Effect, or block a player from a GETSOME or PREGGOS encounter. Don't forget to call in your Wingman when the time is right.&#10;&#10;The heart of the game is the story telling, where you'll create the details of your deeds and how you overcame difficult challenges presented by your so-called friends in pursuit of your next conquest. Your evening will be filled with buddies, belly laughs, and blushing cheeks of the newly acquainted.&#10;&#10;The heart of the replayability is in the multifunction design of many of the cards to perform different tasks depending on your needs. There are an unlimited number of ways for rounds to play out. There's an amazing breadth of crazy things you'll hear yourself say over the course of the night, and a card for just about every occasion. Once you GETSOME, you're definitely going to want to GETSOME again.&#10;&#10;",

Firefights break out in 'mad minutes', followed by lulls where the player exercises leadership by rallying troops, bringing in reserves, and maneuvering his troops to set up for the next firefight.  Firefights center on the machine gun- placement of your MG42's and .30cals are crucial to glorious success or ignominious defeat!&#10;&#10;Scale: &#10;1 figure = 1 soldier or vehicle&#10;1 inch = 2 yards&#10;1 turn = approximately 30 seconds&#10;Combat Lull = 2 to 10 minutes.&#10;&#10;Keeping track of units stats is made easy with quick reference cards included with every pack, detailing the capabilities of every squad, leader, heavy weapon and vehicle.

Now each player can play action cards on two of the hunters and the monster card can attack the third one. Some action cards can take hunters out of the game while others can redirect them to other players (there is no defense against this). When all actions are resolved, the player with most hunter points has to keep the highest hunter card. When after a few rounds the number of hunter points a player has gathered exceeds 7, that player is out. The others continue untili only one monster is left.&#10;&#10;",

Funny people lie for the good of the kingdom, but the poor citizens despise them for their lies. YOU are the authority of darkness, dominate in the shadows of this crazy kingdom. Even the king is afraid of you. Nobles and slaves alike will die not even know your existence. You are invincible and your power is absolute, but one question has been asked that might change the kingdom's fate: &#10;&quot;Who among the kingdom's people has the most power?&quot; &#10; Using only three cards and three &quot;declaration chips,&quot; play a game to earn victory points faster than your opponents.&#10;&#10;Each player plays one of their three cards face down and one of their three chips face up on top of the card. The face up chip can be the true identity of their played card or a lie to try to trick the other players into believing what they are playing. There is an optional round where players can change the chip on their card to a different one. Then the cards are revealed and the way they interact decides who won the round and receives VP. Also, if you were lying or telling the truth with your chip determines if you receive or lose additional VP.&#10;&#10;Designer's

player has 3 cards and 3 tokens, each of which represents Royalty, Assassin, and Slave. Starting player declares a card he will be playing by placing corresponding token face-up, then plays one card face-down. He may lie about the card he's playing. Then next player does the same, and so on. When all players are done, reveal all cards they played and resolve the outcome. If one or more Royalties are in play, each Assassin in play kills one of them. Successful Assassins win the round. After the assassination, if one or more Royalties are still in play, survived Royalties win the round, otherwise all Slaves win the round. Winners get points, and players who have lied and still didn't win the round lose points. A game ends when a player gains total of 8 points. A player with the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Each tile space has a specific tile that can be placed on it. The squares are numbered from 4-64 by fours. The edges of the board are also numbered, from 1-4.&#10;&#10;The game can be played in two ways. In the aptly-named &quot;Game of Chance&quot; two to five players take turns drawing a tile and placing it on its designated space. The player placing the fourth tile around a square scores the value of the square multiplied by the value of the edge of the board corresponding to the played tile.&#10;&#10;The &quot;Game of Skill&quot; is for two players. The scoring rule is the same, but here each player starts with half the blocks and can choose which one to play, generally speaking. If three sides of a block have been played this forces the fourth side to be played as soon as possible, and if that is the third tile for another square it forces that fourth tile immediately, etc.&#10;&#10;The designer patented the game some years before publishing it.&#10;&#10;Note that the board shown in the patent is not exactly the same as the published version, as the rules state the squares in each quarter of the board sum to 136.&#10;&#10;",

It may be used with any scifi background as it has a very minimal theme. Players plot movement and then move simultaneously. Combat can occur at any time during movement when opposing ships are in range and in the weapons firing arc. The goal is simply to destroy the other player's ships.&#10;&#10;Timothy Swenson describes the reasoning for designing this game as follows: &#10;&quot;The premise behind this game is this: what is the simplest playable game possible to game tactical space combat. The game must make some reasonable attempt to come close to simulating space combat and not just the simplest possible game. The emphasis in this game is fast and easy. Playability is given more consideration than realism. There is no consideration for expansion of these rules, because then it would not be minimal. Use the game for those times when you want a quick and dirty space combat game or for introducing someone new to gaming.&quot;&#10;&#10;In addition to the basic game Timothy also has minimal rules for a campaign game, a method for playing solo and a tutorial for introducing new players to space combat games.&#10;&#10;",

Players take on the rolls of Pirate captains taking part in a competition to gather the most Gold and Treasure.  The Captain with the most Gold after all is said and done is the victor.&#10;&#10;Sail into a port, and get gold by selling any cargo you have earned from your acts of piracy.  Pillage ports to gain cargo, but once a pirate pillages a port they must move to another Port to take any more actions.&#10;&#10;There is no honor among Pirates, and it's every Captain for themselves on the high seas.  Players may attack each other and steal Cargo, Gold, or even Treasure that has been found on mysterious islands in the area.  Pirates who take plunder from other players get a Bounty on their heads that goes to the next Pirate to take them down a peg or two.&#10;&#10;Sea Dogs has a whimsical style.  The world it takes place in is populated by animals.  The base game focuses on dogs, but who knows what other animals are out there.&#10;&#10;SeaDogs is a quick playing game that is fun for kids and adults.  And it is designed to be kid friendly so everyone has a chance of winning, while still having enough depth that adults can play together and enjoy it as well.&#10;&#10;",

On most of the squares are parts of companies, which can be bought. The companies have values between 1000 and 8000. Three companies are combined by a color. Whenever a player lands on a win&amp;loss-square, he must draw a card and the wins and losses of the business year are settled. According to the outcome the players gain money or have to pay money for their companies.&#10;As soon as one player goes bankrupt, the game ends, all company cards are sold for their original price. Player with most money is the winner.&#10;&#10;",
