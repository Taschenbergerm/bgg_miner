The player with the most stock of a particular company in his possession acts as the president of this company and is responsible for track laying, the placement of railheads (which are necessary for train runs), route selection and train acquisition. Running trains earns money and this money is either divided by the shareholders or kept in the company's treasure for further investments (like buying better trains or constructing track). This decision influences the value of the company's shares - and not the player with the most stock or the most beautiful constructed track wins the game, but the player with the most riches in terms of cash and shares.&#10;&#10;The game differs from the usual 18xx games a little, as it uses different tokens for either passenger trains or freight trains. The companies also face a lot of building costs - mountains, Amazonas swamps, and crossing a border into another country costs extra.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Aguirre, designed by the writer Bryce Journey, is a thematic Euro-style historical game about the last and most infamous Spanish expedition to find El Dorado. During the course of this expedition, Don Lope de Aguirre (later known as The Madman and The Tyrant) assassinated the conquistador leading the expedition and the nobleman he propped up in his stead before taking over the expedition personally. Recognizing that El Dorado was a myth and that the only gold to be found was back in Peru, Aguirre declared himself Prince of Peru and changed the purpose of his expedition to overthrow the Pizzaros and take over the country for himself. Sailing down the Amazon and Orinoco rivers, Aguirre's expedition faced all manner of challenges in the form of disease, privation, navigation, lack of morale, and attacks from the natives, against whom Aguirre committed barbaric atrocities (there are portions of South America where Aguirre's name is still used as a curse today). Members of Aguirre's expedition discovered to their dismay that the most dangerous of all the challenges, however, was Aguirre's growing paranoia. One by one, Aguirre executed his own men when he grew suspicious of them, sometimes with cause, more often without. Ultimately, Aguirre managed to capture a Spanish fort before being besieged by government forces, when he was executed by one of his own men, one of the few survivors of his ill-fated expedition.&#10;&#10;In the game, players will take on the role of one of the unfortunate members of Aguirre's expedition. Their goal? To accumulate enough influence to overthrow Aguirre before they are executed in turn. In the end, only one player will survive Aguirre&rsquo;s paranoia. Only one player will be able to accumulate enough influence to overthrow him. Only one player will emerge from the depths of hell on earth to tell the tale of The Tyrant Aguirre!&#10;&#10;The principal game mechanics are role/action selection and set collection. Players will earn Influence (victory) Points through a variety of methods, including influencing prominent members of the expedition (the role/action selection part of the game), purchasing Supply Cards (the set collection part of the game), and overcoming thematic challenges. One of these challenges is the &quot;paranoia phase,&quot; in which one of the roles/actions is removed from the game every turn, resulting in a diminishing array of role/actions for players to choose from as the game progresses. The game challenges players to use reactive and adaptive strategy, as players must frequently shift and adjust what they want to do in the game according to the changing conditions of the game.&#10;&#10;Aguirre is a fast-paced game for 2-6 players and lasts 30-90 minutes depending on the number of players.&#10;&#10;",

Each Don will work to make his family the most powerful crime family of the Broad City. Players will set up their smuggling rings, open brothels, control the casinos and gambling in the city, traffic with unlawful alcohol shipments, control the unions and bribe to politicians... But they must be smart enough to don't arouse too much suspicions in the incorruptible side of the law. Their guys can arrested in police raids and the district attorney might his eyes over their affairs.&#10;&#10;The mechanism of the game is based on area control and workers placement, allowing a higher level of interaction with the other players when each player defends his business and try to hinder his opponents.&#10;&#10;A game takes about 90 minutes and offers a lot of options to seize the victory. Will you bribe to politicians to control the crime underworld? Will you become into the new &quot;Capo di tutti capi&quot; by controlling the streets and the monopolizing the smuggling rings? or will you do it controlling the unions? All plays are different: 23 historic events (start of the World War II , end of the Prohibition, Capone arrest...) can modify each play and offer new targets, troubles and options. Nobody said that the thirties were easy years.&#10;&#10;&#10;Spanish description:&#10;&#10;En Broad City Affairs cada jugador representa un Don de una familia mafiosa en una turbulenta ciudad estadounidense en la d&eacute;cada de los 30. Cada Don trabajar&aacute; para llevar a su familia a ser la m&aacute;s influyente en la ciudad y as&iacute; ganar la partida. Para ello deber&aacute; establecer redes de contrabando, abrir negocios de alterne, controlar las casas de juegos, traficar con el alcohol ilegal, controlar los sindicatos, sobornar a pol&iacute;ticos&hellip; todo aquello que sol&iacute;an hacer los mafiosos por aqu&eacute;l entonces. Pero deber&aacute; ser suficientemente astuto como para no despertar demasiadas sospechas en los &ldquo;incorruptibles&rdquo; del lado de la ley, evitando que sus hombres caigan en redadas de la polic&iacute;a o que los fiscales pongan la lupa sobre sus asuntos. Por si fuera poco, las otras familias de la mafia luchar&aacute;n por el control del crimen en la ciudad y no estar&aacute;n demasiado dispuestas a compartir el pastel.&#10;La mec&aacute;nica de Broad City Affairs se basa en el control de zonas y la colocaci&oacute;n de trabajadores obligando a un alto nivel de interacci&oacute;n entre los jugadores y permitiendo que cada jugador defienda sus negocios y estorbe a sus oponentes.&#10;&#10;Las partidas duran aproximadamente 90 minutos y presentan muchas opciones para alzarse con el triunfo. &iquest;Te har&aacute;s con el control del mundo del crimen por medio de los sobornos a los pol&iacute;ticos? &iquest;Ser&aacute; el control de las calles y el monopolio de las redes de contrabando los que te convertir&aacute;n en el nuevo Capo di tutti capi? &iquest;O tal vez lo har&aacute; tu mano de hierro sobre los sindicatos? Adem&aacute;s, ninguna partida es igual que la anterior: 23 eventos hist&oacute;ricos (el comienzo de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, el fin de la Ley Seca, la condena de Al Capone&hellip;) podr&aacute;n modificar cada partida, ofreciendo nuevos retos diferentes en cada una de ellas. Nadie dijo que los a&ntilde;os 30 fuesen unos a&ntilde;os sencillos.&#10;&#10;",

He decides he wishes to marry her and sets off to find her. Unfortunately, he doesn't actually remember anything about her and is left wondering aloud to all: &quot;Does anyone know Cinderella?&quot; Hearing this, many influential people begin spreading rumors that their servant is the actual Cinderella.&#10;&#10;In Too Many Cinderellas, players represent powerful people in the far-off country who are trying to influence the Prince's decision about who is the real Cinderella, pointing him towards their &quot;Cinderella&quot;. If anyone tries to spread misinformation about your &quot;Cinderella&quot;, you can just say &quot;NO!&quot; at the audience with the Prince. Many Cinderellas have gathered; who will be recognized as the real &quot;Cinderella&quot; by the Prince?&#10;&#10;In game terms, the deck of cards is shuffled and each player receives four cards. The person with the smallest feet starts first. A player wins a round when she has the &quot;true&quot; Cinderella. To find the &quot;true&quot; Cinderella, each player lays down a card. The card dictates which card will be or won't be the real Cinderella. When a card is laid down, everyone secretly votes whether or not they want the new rule for that round. This repeats until each player has played two cards. Then everyone reveals their hand, and whoever has the card that matches all the rules laid out in the round is the winner for having the &quot;true&quot; Cinderella. In cases of ties, the winner is the player with the highest card.&#10;&#10;Game #3 in 'The Mike Line' of games from Grail Games.&#10;&#10;",

One has the sense that if Arkham were to fall, it may spell the end of everything. But darkness has ways of being seen. The Ring of Shadows has been found, or maybe wanted to be found, at this critical hour. It's up to the citizens of the Miskatonic Valley to work together to wield its awful power to stop the end before it begins.&#10;&#10;In Shadow of the Elder Gods, 1-4 players take on the roles of citizens of Arkham who work together to prevent cosmic horrors from unraveling reality. Shadow focuses on dealing with the consequences of dark forces conspiring against players, rather than combat. Players take turns spending actions to travel the streets of Arkham researching Knowledge, hiring Muscle, collecting Assets, and dealing with Threats.&#10;&#10;Each game revolves around an inevitable danger to Arkham which is represented by the Threat Deck, a constructed deck of cards which players must survive in order to banish the Elder Threat and win the game. Each threat card features an Arkham face and a Shadow face. The Arkham faces represents the visible manifestations of the unseemly things found on the Shadow faces of the cards. Whenever the player with the Threat Start Marker begins their turn, a Threat token is placed on the current Threat Card and the indicated damage is dealt to players or locations. The first/last card represents the unique Elder Threat which players must contend with in order to win.&#10;&#10;The player who possesses the Ring of Shadows is able to view the Shadow side of the Threat Deck and deal with the Threat at hand by using what resources they have, but they expose themselves and others to harm in the process. If players manage to survive their final encounter with the Elder Threat in the shadows, they unceremoniously save the world from incomprehensible danger.

Long Live the Queen!&#10;&#10;After a terrible epidemic, the Queen has passed on, leaving behind her twin daughters: the determined Princess Black Rose and the ambitious Princess White Rose. The Queen expected to live for a very long time and had not taken the time to declare which of the two would succeed her. Thus, the battle lines are drawn; each Princess has gathered her courtiers around her and is prepared to risk it all in pursuit of the throne. Will prestige be enough to rule the kingdom, or will it&nbsp;take intrigue and violence?&#10;&#10;As a loyal servant for their Princess, each player must&nbsp;manipulate her supporters and use their abilities effectively to gain enough prestige to dominate the proceedings or humiliate the opposing Princess into relinquishing her claim to&nbsp;the throne.&#10;&#10;In Long Live the Queen, each princess is placed opposite the other, with five character tiles placed face down on either side. Beginning with the starting player, the game takes place in turns, during which a player rolls the dice to determine which position is activated, reveals or activates characters, then may reposition a tile. To win, a player must guide their Princess to victory, either by accumulating enough of each type of prestige or by causing the opposing Princess tile to be turned face down.&#10;&#10;",

As curious note, starting from half the &ldquo;Stormboard&rdquo;, every zone becomes more toxic&hellip;&#10;&#10;IS THERE ANY VEXING BETWEEN PLAYERS?&#10;&#10;After the games I&rsquo;ve had, I can tell you that &ldquo;even though could not be &ldquo;PvP&rdquo;, everything suggests that if you are dying from thirst, the Water Source is far away and a nearby survivor has water&hellip; you go for it&rdquo;. Besides, it is the only way of obtaining some objective tokens for your Shelter if another survivor obtained them before. Furthermore It has Mission cards that can be gotten in certain &ldquo;Zones&rdquo;, which pretty motivates players interaction, besides &ldquo;Radio Missions&rdquo; and &ldquo;Individual Missions&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE APART FROM PLAYERS INTERACTION?&#10;&#10;There will be continuous barter, business in the Trading Bazaar, Mercenaries control, Pathfinding, Dogs or Street Children. Caravan dealing and Gambling Houses; provisionally taking refuge in Camps, to put on a Gas Mask in order to not obtaining too much &ldquo;Deterioration&rdquo;, climbing and trying to get out unhurt from &ldquo;Devastated Zones&rdquo;. Dragging on Supplies Boxes towards your Shelter, covered in warm clothes to protect you from the outdoor; fights against Predators and Raiders ambushes&hellip; and if you can do it in a modified vehicle looking with Binoculars, that&acute;s better, isn&acute;t it?&#10;&#10;WELL, I MISS SOMETHING IN IT:&#10;&#10;General Catastrophes, Event cards, enemies that remain on the board and move, 37 Zones and a different board in each game, 3 different board centers, combat system with a single roll (ALWAYS is resolved with a single roll), making your own weapons and improving them, or find them along the way, personalized missions for each Searcher, and we start with 8 Searchers with two capabilities to choose each one of them&hellip; Who said versatility?&#10;&#10;FINALLY:&#10;&#10;&ldquo;After The End&rdquo; is a game from 1 to 4 players that tries to approach a long forgotten theme in board games as far as I know: the fight for survival in the manner of Mad Max, Fallout, I&acute;m Alive or Metro 2033. If you enjoy these masterpieces, without any doubt you should have to check &ldquo;After The End&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;Here you don&acute;t lead an army, nor a survivors group, nor a gang, nor a nation&hellip; it is just your Searcher against the world and the others Searchers, fighting hard for surviving in a devastated and hostile world, and bringing back to his/her Shelter everything is possible before the Storm comes back&hellip;&#10;&#10;I can&acute;t say good bye without telling the reason I did ATE one year and a half ago: I wanted myself a survival game in a post-apocalyptic world, I searched and searched again and I found some titles touching the theme, but not in the way I wanted. So I started to make my own game. Months later, with the prototype finished, I can say I have the game I wanted&hellip; and the intention is making it available to whoever wants it.&#10;&#10;",

When seven cards have been played, they are scored. Animal cards give a higher score then crops, but only if they are combined with a paddock card. The score for tents is dependent on the size of the set.

As an overseer belonging to the Academy, you take orders from the people, gather resources, and transmute them &mdash; but you need to be more efficient than your competition.&#10;&#10;The game lasts four rounds, with each round representing a year. Each round, players take turns placing one or more of their workers on one action they want to do: gather resources, take up an order, employ an assistant, or transmute at the alchemy forges. The trick is that the more workers on one spot, the less effective an action becomes; if you want to place workers on a spot where there are already some, you'll have to exceed the number of workers already there.&#10;&#10;",

You start the game with one card in hand from a deck of sixteen cards. On a turn, you do the following:&#10;&#10;&#10;         Draw: Draw the top card from the deck and add it to your hand.&#10;         Play: Choose one of the two cards in hand to play and place it face up in front of you.&#10;         Effect: Carry out the played card's effect, after which the card is considered as discarded.&#10;         End: If there is at least one card left in the deck, the turn goes to the next player; if not, the investigation phase starts. Using the investigation speed indicated on the card each player has in hand, players take turns guessing which player (whether yourself or someone else) holds the &quot;Lost Legacy&quot; card; this card might also be in the &quot;Ruins&quot;, a location that holds one card at the start of the game and possibly acquires more cards during play. The player who guesses correctly wins; if no one finds the Lost Legacy, then everybody loses.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;",

When no more sets remain, tally the number of sets for each player, then start another round. Whoever has the high score after five rounds wins.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Crossword Set: Each player takes ten dice, then rolls them at the same time to start play, with players trying to combine their dice into a crossword-style grid made of sets.

Who will be the first to establish their own nest and win the game?&#10;&#10;Players take turn swooping the velt momonga from the tree branch to the landing tree in the center. Your momonga lands successfully if it sticks to the landing tree, which is divided into 3 parts by 2 lines. Depending on where your momonga lands, you either move 1, 2 or 3 spaces on the circle tile surrounding the landing tree. If you land on a tile with a paw print, you collect a food by taking one of the outer circle tokens. If you land on a tile where there is another momonga already, you can steal a food from that player.&#10;There are 5 different kinds of foods and the aim is to collect 4 different types. The place where you gathered the last of the required food tokens will be your nest. Next you have to go around the forest one more time to inform your friends of your new home. The first player to complete the circle and land exactly on their own nest, wins the game.&#10;&#10;The game also includes leaf tokens. You can exchange a food token for a leaf token. A leaf token can be played for one of the following two actions:&#10;1) You momonga is allowed to try one more jump.&#10;2) When another player's momonga is making it's jump, you can blow from behind the landing tree to hinder them.&#10;&#10;The rulebook contains a few optional rules to change the base game and some other game variants.&#10;&#10;",

All players then use their own deck of 30 cards (28 bidding cards and 2 blocking cards) to win as many of the six dice as possible by placing one card next to each die.&#10;&#10;The highest bidding card for each die wins that die and its points, unless someone plays a blocking card for that die.  A blocking card blocks ALL players from winning the die, including the person who played the blocking card. Used cards must be discarded at the end of each round.&#10;&#10;If a player wins a &ldquo;TRIPLE&rdquo; (a group of any 3 dice) in a single round of play, they get to roll 1, 2, or 3 of the black dice for additional bonus points, depending on the numbers on the three dice in their TRIPLE.  Roll 1 bonus die for a BASIC TRIPLE (any three numbers), 2 dice for a STRAIGHT TRIPLE (numbers in sequence), and 3 dice for a THREE-OF-A-KIND TRIPLE (all the same number).&#10;&#10;The player or team with the highest score after all five rounds of play (when all cards have been used) wins the game!&#10;&#10;",

Players can dig through the scrapyard, steal from opponents, trade, or draw at random from the decks to achieve their goal.&#10;&#10;In this 1-4 player game, players must rely on strategy, memory, and a little bit of luck to beat opponents, or the deck, by creating their inventions first. The solitaire version runs a speedy 10-15 minutes, while a group game runs between 30-60 minutes.&#10;&#10;In order to win a player must be the first to build 2-3 inventions, which are each constructed from 3 required small machines. These small machines have special abilities which can be activated to give players a 1 time use advantage, such as being able to steal back a stolen part or small machine. In group games each player also has a character given to them at random. These characters all have 1 unique special ability that helps give them an edge in the game. All of these factors make Scrapyard Empire a fun game with a ton of replay value, and endless expansion possibilities for the future.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Beowulf: A Board Game is a dynamic tabletop strategy game for 3-6 players, adapted from one of the oldest and most celebrated works of European literature.&#10;&#10;The game uses the Anglo-Saxon epic poem as a point of entry into a vast interpretation of the Viking Age. As the legend of Beowulf's life and death unfolds on the game's board, players will trade cards, scheme and raid one another to grow their own kingdom's influence and power. After the death of Beowulf at the fangs of a dragon, the game moves forward in time, as players scramble to preserve the brave legacies of their kingdoms in the face of a quickly changing religious landscape and the relentless tides of history.&#10;&#10;The game uses two decks, the WYRD Deck and the DAED Deck. At the beginning of the game each player is dealt a handful of DAED cards - these represent powers, abilities and resources of your individual kingdom. On each turn, a player draws a card from the WYRD Deck, which is composed of monsters, events, hardships, and instances drawn from the source text and the greater Viking Age. The player must either face the consequences, or reap the benefits of these cards, and can use their DAED cards to repel or augment the effect of the WYRD Deck. In addition, players can attempt to raid one another for their DAED cards. Successfully defeating a Monster drawn from the WYRD Deck nets you a Trophy - in the form of some grisly piece of the felled creature - which acts as a counter for your Kingdom's greatness.&#10;&#10;All the while, each draw of the WYRD Deck moves Beowulf further along his life path on the game board, with each stop dramatically affecting the stakes of the WYRD Deck. After Beowulf's death, the winner is determined by the player with the most Trophies amassed.&#10;&#10;",

Lantry and Andrea Sfiligoi.&#10;&#10;As with Songs of Blades and Glory, it uses an action-point system that requires no book-keeping. The rules are designed to be simple, fast and fun so that a mini campaign of several games can be played in a single evening.&#10;&#10;The Basic Game follows closely to the SoBG model, i.e., the game includes statistics for 180+ monsters and heroes, and details to be able to create your own. Also there are campaign rules where your warband grows more powerful after every battle, and six basic scenarios.&#10;&#10;Advanced Rules include the use of an expandable and customizable deck of cards used fro initiative, environmental effects, defence and building a result into historic proportions.&#10;&#10;The game offers co-operative and competitive play Adventures, and can be played in 15mm and 28mm.&#10;&#10;",

There is a fifth card that cannot be used by either player. On a player's turn, she chooses one of her cards, moves one of her pieces according to the chosen card, then replaces the card she used with the fifth card. The other player then chooses one of his cards, moves accordingly, and exchanges that card with this fifth card &mdash; which is, of course, the card the first player just used.&#10;&#10;Moving onto one of the opponent's pawns removes that pawn from the game.

Attu, at the far western end of the Aleutian Archipelago, was American soil. In May 1943, American forces landed on Attu to liberate it. They were unprepared for the tenacity of the Japanese defenders and the brutality of the environmental conditions. What was expected to be a week-long clean-up exercise became a month-long, nose-to-nose meat-grinder whose casualty levels would not be exceeded until Iwo Jima.&#10;&#10;&quot;War in the Wind: The Battle of Attu Island, 1943&quot; is a low-to-moderate complexity wargame (roughly eight pages of rules) depicting the brutal combat and conditions on Attu. The design focuses on the challenges faced by the American forces in the form of extremely variable weather conditions and logistical hurdles posed by nearly insurmountable terrain. The Japanese must use these conditions to their advantage in order to survive the overwhelming American numbers.&#10;&#10;In addition to the campaign game covering the entire battle, War in the Wind also includes three smaller scenarios focusing on separate phases of the battle.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 1 day&#10;Hex: 400 yards / 366 meters&#10;Units: Platoon to Company&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheet&#10;Two dual-side printed countersheets (324 9/16&quot; counters - includes 42 blanks)&#10;One 20-page War in the Wind rules booklet&#10;Two dual-side printed Player Aid cards&#10;Three 10-sided dice&#10;&#10;Complexity: Medium&#10;Solitaire Suitability: High&#10;Players: 1 or more&#10;Playing Time: 1-10 Hours&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Between 230 and 221 B.C., the ambitious and extremely young king of Qin, Ying Zheng, unified China, adding all the other so-called Warring States (ZhanGuo) to his empire. Through this, Ying Zheng became the first emperor in Chinese history, taking the title of Qin Shi Huang Di.&#10;&#10;Plenty of things had to change in order to make the Chinese empire whole, and Qin Shi Huang Di didn't waste any time. He divided the empire into prefectures, personally appointing central and local functionaries; afterward, he decreed that the same writing symbols had to be used throughout the entire nation. Furthermore, he unified the laws and the units of measure, particularly the currency, creating amazing conditions for the economic development and growth of the empire.&#10;&#10;Internal decisions were not the only things that shaped this new unified nation. From the North, the menace of the Hsiungnu barbarians kept shaking the empire, and Qin Shi Huang Di knew that the only way to stop that menace was to build one of the most ambitious buildings in human history: The Great Wall of China. Thousands of peasants left their fields to take part in the construction, not only of the Great Wall, but also of roads, channels, palaces, and majestic buildings.&#10;&#10;In ZhanGuo, you are the emperor's emissaries, and you have been assigned the challenging task of contributing to the process of unifying the empire, helping to build the wall, and all infrastructures needed. During the five rounds of the game, you must make the best of the few cards you get each round. You can play each card either on your own player board to increase your personal power in the empire, or on the game board to recruit manpower, construct buildings wanted by the emperor, call reinforcements from Qin, and move the armies from kingdom to kingdom.&#10;&#10;Each player has to choose the best time and best way to play his cards in order to earn the emperor&rsquo;s favors. Careful, though, because trying to get too much power, or exploiting the workers for personal gain could increase dissatisfaction among the populace, and consequently increase the risk of uprisings in the newly added kingdoms. Whoever is able to make the greatest contribution to the emperor's cause, while at the same time keeping the citizens placid, will be the winner.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "There's always something happening in the city that never sleeps. Maybe it's the lights, maybe it's the energy, or maybe it's the giant monsters trying to demolish the place!&#10;&#10;King of New York is a standalone game from designer Richard Garfield that keeps the core ideas of King of Tokyo while introducing new ways to play. As in KoT, your goal is to be the first monster to collect 20 victory points (VPs) or to be the last monster standing. On your turn, you roll six dice up to three times, then carry out the actions on those dice. Claws cause damage to other monsters, hearts heal damage to yourself, and energy is stored up so that you can purchase power cards that provide unique effects not available to anyone else.&#10;&#10;What's new in King of New York is that you can now try to become a star in the big city; more specifically, you can achieve &quot;Fame&quot;, which nets you VPs, but superstar status is fleeting, so enjoy your time in the spotlight.&#10;&#10;The game board for King of New York is larger than in KoT with each monster occupying a district in the city and everyone trying to shine in Manhattan. When you attack, you can displace a monster in another district, whether to escape military forces or to find new smashing opportunities. Yes, smashing because you can now destroy buildings and get bonuses for doing so, but the more destruction you cause, the more intense the military response.&#10;&#10;The monsters from King of New York can be used in KoT and vice versa, but the power cards are specific to this game.&#10;&#10;Part of the King of Tokyo series.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "This edition of Carcassonne: Wheel of Fortune includes the Bridges, Castles and Bazaars expansion.&#10;&#10;Carcassonne: Wheel of Fortune is both a full replacement for the base game of Carcassonne and an expansion to the original base game. It includes 72 tiles, consisting of 63 tiles released in the original base game, 6 from Inns &amp; Cathedrals, 1 from Traders &amp; Builders and 2 from King &amp; Scout. It also includes a special replacement start tile which depicts the Wheel of Fortune, a new mechanic unique to this edition of the game. The new start tile is the size of 16 tiles, arranged in a 4&times;4 square and is built using some of the tiles removed from the base game.&#10;&#10;Nineteen tiles from the game have numbers printed on them allowing players to randomly spin the Wheel of Fate (between 1 and 3 spaces around the wheel). Otherwise, a player may choose to place a follower on the wheel if they decline placing a follower that turn. The results of the Wheel vary depending on which of the sixths of the wheel the pig lands on. Results vary from forcing all players to remove a follower from the board to rewarding the player who moves the pig with three bonus points. There are six outcomes in all.&#10;&#10;Play of this game does not require ownership of any Carcassonne base game. All expansions are compatible with this game. This game can also be played with the base game as an expansion, using its wagon wheel watermark to differentiate it from the base game.&#10;&#10;Bridges, Castles and Bazaars is the eighth expansion for Carcassonne. It allows players three new options while playing:&#10;&#10;Bridges may be used to continue a road over a field tile, thereby allowing an incomplete road to technically run into a field segment. They are otherwise treated and scored just like roads.&#10;&#10;Castle tokens are placed atop 2-segment cities and allow players a chance to cash-in on the next completed adjacent feature.&#10;&#10;Bazaars are a new type of tile that allows players to auction off tiles in exchange for points.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "A wonderful weekend in a wood cabin with friends to relax, with drinks and food, a party...and blood! An evil as old as time has awoken and it is possessing you all by taking advance of your weakness. If nobody finds the book of the dead and destroys it, this will be your last night as humans.&#10;&#10;The Possession is a game for 3 to 5 players in which time is against them. The evil is stalking you and each round the players could be possessed by it, and becoming one of the thirsty blood demons looking for living souls, the other players' souls!&#10;&#10;At the beginning of a round, all players roll a die: the more wounds you have, the more easily you become a possessed. Then players play an action card to indicate how many actions they can play and how much they risk suffering an evil event. This risk is higher in the cards that give more actions.&#10;&#10;When a player finds enough pages from the book of the dead and burns them in an altar, before the evil owns all players, he becomes the winner. By using the action points, players can cover the house looking for the pages as well as objects, weapons, and keys to get into the basement and attic-; they can also rest in order to get back the action cards played and heal wounds to keep alive.&#10;&#10;A possessed player must attack his friends so that the evil inside him feeds of his crime and not with his soul. He will be able to smash doors, escape for windows to get inside in other rooms and so, surprise another players. He will have more action points depending on his possessing level.&#10;&#10;The other players can attack the possessed ones. The only way to stop them is dismembering them completely &mdash; but these amputated members will be wandering around ready to claw and strangle whoever gets close enough...&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "SOCCER BLAST is designed to bridge the gap between highly detailed soccer games that play in the 90-120 minute range and quick-play games which are primarily designed to generate realistic scores. PLAAY Games has taken the basic game engine from its hockey and lacrosse games, and modified it to capture the more refined nuances of classic football. The result: a sports board game that gives fans everything they love about watching soccer, captured in a 30-45 minute game window.&#10;&#10;Despite the quick playing time, SOCCER BLAST provides surprising detail and the genuine sense of witnessing a full, realistic football match from start to finish. Individual players' true-to-life abilities are captured simply but realistically, using a series of easy-to-understand symbols and descriptive qualities. These individual performances synch together to create realistic team results that will make you feel like you're in the stands watching the game for real!&#10;&#10;SOCCER BLAST was created in such a way as to place an emphasis on story and context. Yes, the statistics are important, and we think you'll be pleased with the numerical results. However, this game is more than just numbers. The usual assortment of drama-inducing elements and game mechanics that PLAAY Games have become known for have been built into this game as well. For example, referees can affect play--and BE affected by play. If somebody says the wrong thing to a ref, his team might have to pay for it. In SOCCER BLAST, you'll occasionally see a subjective referee call that should have gone the other way, and you'll experience that palpable sense of joy, or disgust, depending on your leaning!&#10;&#10;The game offers many other features. The advantage of playing on one's home pitch is very real, but not over-stated. Injuries will play a factor, and you may be chagrined to see your star player carted off the field with the match hanging in the balance. Fatigue is a factor, too--you'll face the same challenge with late-game substitutions that a real soccer coach faces, and you'll need to plan accordingly. And, the game comes with a full complement of unusual and rare results waiting to add memorable twists to your tabletop sports archives.&#10;&#10;Finally, SOCCER BLAST Pro Soccer Game allows you to rate your own teams with its &quot;How-To&quot; guide, made available at a nominal extra charge. The world is filled with soccer teams and every country has its own league or leagues. Ordinarily, this poses a problem for game companies because while many of these leagues have devoted fan followings, they're not large enough to warrant the time and energy of creating cards for them. If you have your OWN favorite team or league, you won't have to depend on PLAAY Games to make cards for you&mdash;you'll be able to make them yourself!&#10;&#10;",

A horde of GodZ are battling to be the most powerful deity of the pantheon: Will you play the role of Tud, God of Mountains, Mud and Ugly Snouts? Or will you dwell in the ocean bottom with Glu, God of the Sea, of Fried Fish and of Octoguys? Whichever god you are going to incarnate, you will lay the foundations of your brand new cult, creating life, building temples and guiding your mighty Avatar amongst mortals. Lead your followers in epic, god-sized battles, and become the most powerful of the GodZ!&#10;&#10;In GodZ, players take control of one of the deities of the world of Super Fantasy: Ugly Snouts Assault. The game takes place on a modular, hexed board that is built up by players as the game proceeds. Victory can be achieved in different ways: controlling regions, conquering cities, fighting, building, or being adored by huge amounts of followers.&#10;&#10;The heart of the game is the action system, based on a mechanism that allows players to perform miracles and actions, and even to directly score points, choosing their priorities carefully each turn: the more powerful their actions, the fewer points they will score when their followers pray.&#10;&#10;",

As members of the elite Vice Squad, you'll be traveling around Charm City in an attempt to build a case and catch your Suspect before the end of the Plot. Charm City Blues is completely cooperative with each player having a personal Vice that effects the way you play the game.&#10;&#10;Charm City Blues is played on a 5x4 grid of cards laid out in numerical order to create Charm City. At the start of the game players will choose a Difficulty and Suspect and deal 12 cards from the Plot deck. Then, roll the d20 Clue die 4 times to spawn Clues on the Location cards with the corresponding number. The goal of the game is to build a case and catch the Suspect by filling up the Difficulty and Suspect cards with clues before the Plot deck runs out.&#10;&#10;Each round of Charm City Blues is divided into two phases, the Plot phase and the Investigation phase. During the Plot phase the player with the Commissioner token flips the top card of the Plot deck. This card gives a narrative cue which the Commissioner will expand on in telling a few lines of story about the game so far. Then, each player will have a chance to gain clues during their Investigation.&#10;&#10;Each player has four abilities: Fight, Arrest, Research, and Interrogate. During your investigations you will test these abilities by rolling the number of d6 listed next to your Ability and trying to match or beat the number required on the Location card. If you succeed, you move the Clue up to the Difficulty or Suspect card and gain some cold hard cash. If you fail, you lose Hit Points or gain Suspicion Points. Lose too many Hit Points or gain too may Suspicion Points and the game is over.&#10;&#10;",

As a head of a powerful family, each player will breed mighty dragons, make use of their special abilities, gather resources and try to make their house the most powerful by gathering the most Power Points. The game is played in a sequence of turns, with each turn allowing a player to perform 1 Main Action and any number of Free Actions. As a Main Action, a player will usually place a worker on an Action Space.&#10;&#10;The workers (collectively known as Vassals) come in two types: Spearmen &ndash; young warriors of each house, and Dragonriders &ndash; noble warriors and hunters gifted with their own Simurgh steed. On their turn, each player will place one of their Vassals on an empty Action Space to gain resources, exchange their assets for Power Points, add new Vassals to their house or breed a new type of Simurgh.&#10;&#10;During the game, players will collectively build the board by drawing and placing Action Tiles, each either providing new Action Spaces (some allowing any Vassals, some exclusively the Dragonriders), or creating an opportunity to score points for combinations of specific dragons in a player&rsquo;s possession. When all the scoring spaces are filled with tiles, the game ends at the end of the round and Power Points are tallied.&#10;&#10;",

Somehow, though, the story keeps happening, and another bellicose mob has advanced on the imposing walls of someone else&rsquo;s keep. The clash to control those walls is at hand. Lead the Blue attackers or the Red defenders, using clever card play and a touch of luck to control more sections of the wall than your opponent&#10;&#10;The game consists of 54 cards -- 5 walls, a Red personal deck of 8 cards, a Blue personal deck of 8 cards, and a main deck of 33 cards.&#10;&#10;Players take turns playing Archer, Cannon, Attack, Leader and Flag cards from their hands to the different walls. Archers &amp; Cannons each have a strength value, and the player with the most total strength at a wall controls it. Attacks remove the opponent's cards, Leaders each have a unique ability that impacts how strength is calculated at a wall, and Flags lock down the control of a wall and trigger the end game.&#10;&#10;The player controlling the most walls at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Primarily designed as a solitaire game for sports board game hobbyists, it can also be played head-to-head, with each player making decisions for his team.&#10;&#10;From the publisher:&#10;&#10;We've taken our original lacrosse game, Crash and Scramble, and made it even better by adapting it to the same game engine that powers our popular hockey game, Hockey Blast. The result is a fast-playing, fun board game simulation of this cutting-edge pro sport that captures everything fans love about it: bone-jarring hits, acrobatic passes, rocket-fast shots, and amazing saves. YOU can re-create all the thrilling action of this &quot;ahead-of the curve&quot; sport, right in your own home, with Lacrosse Blast Pro Indoor Lacrosse Game!&#10;&#10;Lacrosse Blast uses a possession-by-possession system of play that keeps things moving fast. The game uses the same easily-memorized chart structure and no-nonsense method of rating players as our hockey game. Players perform based on the presence--or absence--of various qualities like speed, power and skill. Each player is also rated for his ability in creating and/or taking away scoring opportunities, as well as for shots and assists, penalties, face-offs and injury. That means you'll get table-top performances which echo each player's real-life abilities without a bunch of calculations or math gymnastics. You'll see the great assist guys dishing it off for goals and the powerhouse shooters firing the ball into the net, while the less-talented players defer to someone else. You'll be caught up in the action as you &quot;watch&quot; players use their power, skill and savvy to make plays. Goalies have their own special ratings, designed to make the real-life star net-minders shine on your table top the just way they do on the pro league floor! Easy-to-play, but amazingly detailed--THAT'S Lacrosse Blast Pro Indoor Lacrosse simulation board game!&#10;&#10;",

The Land Run of Oklahoma has just taken place, and now you and your opponent strive to get your Boomers the largest homesteads &mdash; but that can be harder than it looks!&#10;&#10;Each player has three Boomers. On a turn, a player moves one Boomer in a straight line on the game board grid, moving it as many spaces as they wish. After this, he may use this Boomer and one of the opponent's Boomers to place cornerstones on the game board; these cornerstones are placed on the intersections where these two Boomers would meet, should they move toward one another. (If one of the Boomers couldn't reach an intersection point due to another piece being in the way, that cornerstone is not placed.)&#10;&#10;Chains of cornerstones form borders on the game board, and at some point these borders will close off certain areas from the rest of the game board. If Boomers of only one color are in an area, this area/homestead belongs to the owner of those Boomers.&#10;&#10;The game ends once all Boomers have their own homestead. Players receive 1 point for every square in their homesteads, and whoever has the higher score wins.&#10;&#10;Backers on Spieleschmiede also got 4 small expansions:&#10;- Red River&#10;- Santa Fe&#10;- Silberminen&#10;- Sooner&#10;&#10;",

It comes with two separate games in one package.&#10;&#10;Operation S&uuml;dwind is a two-player/solitaire game recreating the mid-February 1945 German offensive against the Soviet Bridgehead across the Garam River, in what is now southwestern Slovakia. It commenced on the morning of February 17. The German attack spearheads included a total of 44 formidable Tiger II tanks. Subsidiary attacks from across the Danube helped weaken the Soviet positions. 7th Guard Army defended stubbornly but was barely reinforced and by February 24th the Germans cleared the bridgehead. The Germans won a clear-cut operational victory but they incurred hard-to-replace losses. In the grand scheme of things Operation S&uuml;dwind was a localized, and only temporary setback ,for the Soviets.&#10;&#10;Operation Gemse is a two-player/solitaire game recreating the fierce early March German offensive in Oberlausitz and lower Siliesia against the unsuspecting Soviet 3rd Guard Tank Army commanded by General Rybalko. Securing Lauban and the surrounding area was deemed critical for a possible relief of encircled Breslau. However the planned grand encirclement anchored on Naumburg soon proved too ambitious. Instead on March 5 the F&uuml;hrer-Grenadier and F&uuml;hrer-Begleit Panzer divisions completed their reduced pincer movement and met up in S&auml;chsisch-Haugsdorf. By March 7th, the encircled Soviet 7th Guard Tank Corps was almost completely destroyed.&#10;&#10;",

The Allied objectives are to land successfully and push far enough off the beaches to guarantee a rapid advance into France.

The importance of the initial air-drops, the real potential for brutal German counterattacks, and the need to get off the beaches quickly, all these come into sharp focus within the clean and fast-playing framework of the Standard Combat Series. Players can tackle the US landings separately as single-map scenarios, the Commonwealth landings on two maps, and of course there is the Whole Enchilada.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 1/2 day turns&#10;Hex: 700 meters&#10;Units: Platoon/Company/Battalion&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;Game specific scenario/rulebook&#10;SCS 1.7 rules&#10;4 11&quot; x 17&quot; setup charts&#10;4 22&quot; x 34&quot; maps&#10;8 countersheets&#10;2 six-sided dice&#10;&#10;List of Scenarios:&#10;&#10;Full campaigns:&#10;&#10;Full Campaign: 6/6 - 6/15&#10;After D-Day Campaign: 6/7 - 6/15&#10;Mid-Campaign: 6/10 - 6/15&#10;&#10;Mini-campaigns:&#10;&#10;Utah beach (Map A only): 6/6 - 6/15&#10;Utah beach (Map A only): 6/7 - 6/15&#10;Omaha beach (Map B only): 6/6 - 6/15&#10;Omaha beach (Map B only): 6/7 - 6/15&#10;American beaches (Maps A &amp; B ): 6/6 - 6/15&#10;American beaches (Maps A &amp; B ): 6/7 - 6/15&#10;British and Canadian beaches (Maps C &amp; D): 6/6 - 6/15&#10;British and Canadian beaches (Maps C &amp; D): 6/7 - 6/15&#10;&#10;Smaller scenarios:&#10;&#10;Carentan (part of Map A): 6/10 - 6/14&#10;Cutting off the Contentin (part of Map A): 6/13 - 6/15&#10;Canadaian Crucible (part of Map C ): 6/8 - 6/10&#10;Villers Bocage (Map C): 6/12 - 6/15&#10;&#10;",

A finite version of the game is Myriades.&#10;&#10;Infinito is played on a square board, preferably 10x10 or larger. One player owns the black stones, the other player owns the white stones. Grey neutral stones are needed.&#10;&#10;Each player has an infinite number of stones with an unique natural number printed on them: 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on...&#10;(For practical use, you can have blank stones and write numbers on them.)&#10;&#10;Players move alternately, starting with the player controlling the white stones. Each turn consists of two actions, performed in this order:&#10;&#10;1. OPTIONAL MOVE: you can move a stone exactly as a Queen&rsquo;s moves in Chess, i.e. any number of cells horizontally, vertically or diagonally.&#10;If your stone ends its move (orthogonally and diagonally) next to one enemy stone whose value is less than your stone, and your stone wasn&rsquo;t (orthogonally and diagonally) next to that enemy stone to start its move, replace any friendly stone &ndash; but the stone just moved &ndash; on the board with a neutral gray stone with &ldquo;&infin;&rdquo; printed on it. In one move you can end up close to more enemy stones whose value are less than your stone, in that case you replace your stones with neutral stones for each of those stones.&#10;When you remove your stones from the board, those stones will be available for future placements.&#10;&#10;2. COMPULSORY PLACEMENT: you must place a stone onto any empty space.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the board is full, whoever has the least sum of his values wins.&#10;&#10;",

To combat this threat, Lady Penelope, the Thunderbirds&rsquo; aristocratic English secret agent, and her chauffeur Parker lead a network of agents to uncover those behind the disasters caused by deliberate sabotage.&#10;&#10;A criminal mastermind known as &ldquo;The Hood&rdquo;, operating from a temple deep in the Malaysian jungle and in possession of strange powers, often engineers events to allow him to spy on the Thunderbird machines with the goal of selling their secrets to the highest bidder.&#10;&#10;The iconic Thunderbirds are designed by the Tracy family&rsquo;s close friend &ldquo;Brains&rdquo; and are assigned to each of the five Tracy brothers:&#10;- Thunderbird 1, piloted by Scott Tracy &ndash; a hypersonic rocket plane used for fast response and rescue-zone reconnaissance, and as a mobile control base.&#10;- Thunderbird 2, piloted by Virgil Tracy &ndash; a supersonic VTOL carrier which transports their major rescue equipment in detachable pods.&#10;- Thunderbird 3, piloted by Alan Tracy &ndash; a single-stage, vertically launched spacecraft&#10;- Thunderbird 4, piloted by Gordon Tracy &ndash; a utility submersible for underwater rescue, launched from Thunderbird 2&#10;- Thunderbird 5, manned by John Tracy &ndash; a space station in geo-stationary orbit that monitors calls for help from across Earth.&#10;&#10;Finally, Lady Penelope has the iconic FAB 1, driven by Parker &ndash; a pink, amphibious car.&#10;&#10;Thunderbirds is a cult 1960s British science-fiction television series, created by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson. It was produced using a combination of marionette puppetry and scale-model special effects, which was dubbed &ldquo;Supermarionation&rdquo;. Two series, totaling thirty-two 50-minute episodes, were produced, along with two films using the same techniques.&#10;&#10;Players will work together using Thunderbirds characters and vehicles to complete rescue missions and save the day.&#10;&#10;",

Each player has 50 stones, numbered from 0 to 49. Such numbers represents the value of the stones.&#10;&#10;Grey stones are neutral, without value and, once placed on the board, they are immovable.&#10;&#10;Players move alternately, starting with the player controlling the white stones. Each turn consists of two actions, performed in this order:&#10;&#10;1. OPTIONAL MOVE: you can move a stone of your color as a Queen&rsquo;s moves in Chess, i.e. any number of cells horizontally, vertically or diagonally.&#10;If your stone ends its move (orthogonally and diagonally) next to one enemy stone whose value is less, and your stone wasn&rsquo;t (orthogonally and diagonally) next to that enemy stone to start its move, replace any friendly stone &ndash; but the stone just moved &ndash; on the board with a neutral gray stone. In one move you can end up close to more enemy stones whose value are less than your stone, in that case you replace your stones with neutral stones for each of those stones.&#10;When you remove your stones from the board, those stones will be available for future placements.&#10;&#10;2. COMPULSORY PLACEMENT: you must place a stone onto any empty space.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the board is full, whoever has the least sum of his values wins.&#10;&#10;",

When you find the object, place it on the table, move your pawn one step further on the score board and draw another card. When a pawn crosses a Challenge Line for the first time, the game stops for a while and a Challenge is played.

One player can move the pawns along columns, while the other moves them along rows. Players cannot move the same pawn they moved the previous turn, so strategy is built around knowing which choices your opponent has next, and working to make those choices miserable &mdash; thus putting them in a dilemma. Some of the tiles affect the board when collected: moving tiles or pawns, returning pieces to the board, or stealing tiles from an opponent. When neither player can move, the game ends and whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Skillful maneuvering and forethought are the name of the game in this engaging, classical board game.&#10;&#10;",

When the locomotive is steaming and ready the train be quite quick. Two or more build a common train or build their own one. Made from wood, so childrens hands can have a strong grip too. The game: From the wooden tiles coloured trains are built. The die sets the colour so everyone has a chance in this fast-paced tile laying game made out of wood.&#10;&#10;The rulebook suggests two games: In one game one locomotive is put in the middle of the table. The wagons are shuffled and dealt to the players. The players take turns rolling the die and then adding to the locomotive if they have rolled the appropriate colour or black which is a joker in this game. The first player getting rid of all his/her wagon tiles is the rounds winner and gets a conductor tile. After 4 rounds the game ends, the player with the most conductors wins.&#10;&#10;In a second variant each player gets a locomotive and the wagon tiles are put in the middle of the table. Then there must be an agreement which train will be the winning one: The longest one, the most colourful on or one in a single colour. Players take turns rolling the die and taking a wagon of the rolled colour. The rulebook is unclear if taking a wagon is optional or compulsory in this variant.&#10;&#10;",

Some characters need to identify certain other character (e.g. Student wants to find Sunflower), while others need to be identified by certain character (Banana wants to be found by the Student). After some discussion, players that need to find another character can attempt to guess who that character is. If this fulfills any player's victory condition, the round ends, with those players scoring a point each.&#10;&#10;",

Like 20 Questions for books, the objective of the game is to find the Bookworm hidden by the Librarian somewhere in a bookshelf of over 30 books.  Players ask Yes or No questions to remove books from the shelves, narrowing the choices until the Bookworm is found. With simple rules, three shelves, four Bookworms, over 65 titles to pick from, and player questions limited only by your imagination, no two games will ever be the same!&#10;&#10;Pre-readers can ask questions about the younger titles' colors, locations, and pictures. They can also use the icons to know if there is magic in the game and if the main characters are male, female, or animals.&#10;&#10;Older players can test themselves by asking detailed plot and character questions about the older titles. They can also hide multiple bookworms, add a timer, and/or leave the books on the shelf for a serious mental challenge!&#10;&#10;",

The team starts in their 20s with a salary, multiple Stock Tokens to invest in companies, and empty savings accounts.  Every round starts with paying salaries, doubling the value of each savings account, and rolling the dice to find which companies pay off investments - or potentially go out of business. If companies go out of business, their tiles are removed from the game, potentially blocking players' paths to the Big Goals and Home. Then, it is the team&rsquo;s turn, and each player makes several actions toward winning the game: Move, Invest, Achieve, Save, or Withdraw.&#10;&#10;With good planning, lots of teamwork, and a bit of luck, players will achieve their Big Goals and retire in style as successful Investars!&#10;&#10;As a bonus, while you're having fun playing Investars, you'll also learn a bit about compound interest, savings accounts, and planning for long-term goals. In short, you'll learn how to be better investors!&#10;&#10;",

Each player takes a turn flipping some of the coins in their hand of coins to determine where they are able to play. They then place one coin on the map and this activates the special ability of that particular location. It might allow the players to draw more coins or move coins on the map along arrows, for example.&#10;&#10;Each turn the current player flips 3 coins for Cthulhu which causes Cthulhu to steal coins from the players or fill up the Carcosa track, limiting the maximum hand size of all players.&#10;&#10;The players win if they can get 3 heads on two particular locations on the board and Cthulhu wins if it steals enough coins from the players or fills up the Carcosa track. The type of coins used is not important.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In Town Center, players build a city &ndash; in particular, the town center. They add cubes on their personal board and try to arrange them as best as possible in order to score the most victory points. Each cube represents a different type of module. Flats, shops, offices, generators, lifts, car parks, town hall can be built and stacked during the course of the game. Each module generates influence on adjacent land and on cubes directly below or above.&#10;&#10;Each round, players will gain two cubes of different colors through a non-random mechanism, build them on their game board, then eventually stack them in order to make towers according to the building rules. If the players have done their job well, some modules will be able to evolve, becoming bigger in three dimensions. The last phase is an income phase in which players gain money from the shops and parking lots if they are supplied with electricity.&#10;&#10;The bigger and higher your city is, the more victory points players will have at the end of the game, which lasts ten rounds &ndash; but do not forget to provide electricity to all your flats, shops, and lifts to make them more efficient.&#10;&#10;&#10;Changes in the fourth edition:&#10;&#10;Has a new map printed on the reverse of the boards. Earlier editions of Town Center did not have 2 maps, just 1. This means that each of the player boards has an alternate city plan to play with.&#10;&#10;Contains the Central Park solo board, previously released separately as the Manhattan t-shirt, on the back of the central board.&#10;&#10;Has a bigger box that now fits all the cubes comfortably, and has space for expansions.&#10;&#10;Has a bigger rulebook, in separate languages, with updated rules, including rules for up to 8 players to play together by combining two sets of the game.&#10;&#10;16 player cubes in 8 colors in each box to allow for games with more than 4 players, by combining 2 copies of Town Center.&#10;&#10;Revamped player maps with wider streets that are compatible with future planned expansions.&#10;&#10;Added central board with a track around it, a simpler method to track income and points.&#10;&#10;Improved player aid that now includes Phase V (in Editions 1&ndash;3, Phases IV and V were both encompassed in Phase IV) and more detail in Phase I explanation.&#10;&#10;Doubled the size of the cloth bag - now all cubes can all be stored in it without spilling out, and there's space for enough cubes for 5-8 players to be pulled from it.&#10;&#10;Note: You need two copies of the same edition* (or a copy of the 3rd edition and a copy of the 4th edition) to play with up to 8 players. Each copy contains enough building cubes and player boards for up to 4 players.&#10;&#10;* 3rd and 4th edition are the only 2 editions with the same size of cubes. 1st edition's much smaller cubes, 2nd editions LEGO bricks, and Deluxe edition's way larger cubes are not compatible with the 3rd and 4th edition cubes; the 5&ndash;8-player rules require all players to select their cubes from the same draft towers.&#10;&#10;",

The result was a macrocosm that could not be mapped and in which no one could settle.  Now, thrust together, these great creatures have been locked in an infinite war, for each species believes that it is its world that is the primary and its right to take control of the new Empyrean.&#10;&#10;As a player of Titans of Empyrean, you control a squad of 4 titans placed on a tiny hex battlefield in the sky.  Every moving, it is your responsibility to maneuver your titans into positions of opportunity and advantage.  Each unique titan has its own special ability and is armed with a deck of maneuver cards for use throughout the game.  But be careful.  While these powerful maneuvers can be the key to victory, they also double as lifeblood of your titans.  Without them, your titan's wounds cannot be healed.&#10;&#10;Position your titans.&#10;&#10;Manage your maneuvers.&#10;&#10;Attack!&#10;&#10;Will your titans control the new Empyrean?&#10;&#10;",

The two board games are distinct, different, and have different rules. The two board games can be united together and played following the instructions as &quot;The Deluxe Game&quot; or &quot;Super KGB&quot;.&#10;&#10;In &quot;Project CIA: the secret formula&quot;, 17 envelopes are scattered in designated spots on the board game. One of the 17 envelopes has the secret formula. By rolling the dice, players move around the board game and as they pass over the positions where the envelopes are, they pick up the tile and see if it has the secret formula printed on the bottom of the tile. The winner of the game is the one that exits the board game from one of its four entrance/exit gates.&#10;&#10;There is a clear moving piece representing a security guard that moves around from one room to another room. If a player finds himself inside a room with the security guard, he/she has one turn to exit the room.&#10;&#10;In Game 2, you're either an agent trying to identify the double agent, or you're the latter, sabotaging the training camp. Deception and deduction will keep you scrambling!&#10;&#10;Super KGB is what you get when you combine both games 1 and 2. Waddingtons included extra pieces in both sets so you could play a Deluxe version of either game using both boards. Super KGB can be played by up to six, whereas the component games are limited to four.&#10;&#10;This is the version from Waddington's with both games in one box.&#10;&#10;",

The game decks also include artwork used with the new Flanking rules.&#10;&#10;Spurs and Sprockets is a perfect information, abstract strategy game. Players have eight matching tiles that they take turns placing orthogonally into a grid, in an attempt to link three or four in a row. There is no board in Spurs and Sprockets so the grid grows organically, based on the placement of tiles. The grid also varies in size and dimensions based on the number of players.&#10;&#10;Spurs and Sprockets sets comes with sixteen tiles and rules for many different ways of playing, ranging from a simple Tic-Tac-Toe-like game where players gain 8 points for four in a row and 3 points for each set of three in a row, to a game where every placement of a tile may result in an attack and removal of another tile.&#10;&#10;",

The crew on the front lines are in constant need of new supplies and equipment, so the Federation has set up a massive supply line network. This network is composed of massive space stations called Foundries. Some Foundries are specialized in mining and processing ore from asteroids. Other Foundries are equipped with robotic manufacturing and repair facilities. Their job is to keep the flow of supplies going efficiently as possible.&#10;&#10;The gameplay in Far Space Foundry occurs in two distinct halves: Space Foundry Alpha and Space Foundry Beta.&#10;&#10;At Space Foundry Alpha, you mine skyrite (blue crystals) and rubion (red ore) and process the two to make galactium (purple metal). On your turn, you play a card that allows you to either land a shuttle on a docking bay or take off from one. The shuttle will transport raw materials either from the asteroid or to your freighters. Each docking bay has a special ability if activated that turn, like ore processing or galactic traders. At this foundry, you must also build a fleet of freighters to haul your items. To do this, you must visit the cantina to recruit help from various alien captains (with unique abilities). Once everyone has played all of their cards, it's time to head off to a new board...&#10;&#10;At Space Foundry Beta, you take all of your acquired materials and transport them down to the station. There the robots will use that material to make various products of varying worth. Besides manufacturing, you may also upgrade your freighters or charge up your existing products for more points. Once the freighters are filled back up again, it's time to transport the items to their final destination for final scoring!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The title of First to Fight refers to the famous slogan and poster distributed in European countries after Poland was the first country to be attacked by Germany in September 1939. This game, released by Fabryka Gier Historycznych (Historical Games Factory)in cooperation with Fundacja Niepodleg&#197;&#130;o&#197;&#155;ci (Foundation for Independence), takes place throughout the entirety of World War II, with the players taking the roles of commanders of the Polish forces that are fighting on numerous fronts: Eastern and Western Europe, Africa, etc. By allocating their troops in different regions of the world, they aim to carry out missions (including the most famous battles of WW2) and earn victory points (VPs). The players do not &quot;own&quot; or control the soldiers, which are represented by neutral cards, moved by the players around the board, and activated only when it is the time to play a mission card in a given region; that said, their particular specialization may increase a player's chance to win a mission. The player with the most VPs at the end of the War (May 1945) wins.&#10;&#10;The game presents true historical characters, events and places. First to Fight shows the scale of various activities that took place during the war &ndash; but it is not a wargame. Over its 40-70 minute playing time, a player will get to know many people and places that played an important role in achieving the victory over Germany. Among the soldiers to command, you can find Antoni Chru&#197;&#155;ciel ps. Monter, August Emil Fieldorf ps. Nil, Jan Kozielewski ps. Jan Karski, Zdzis&#197;&#130;aw Jeziora&#197;&#132;ski ps.

The base can produce certain types of units, which in turn can produce other types of units. In addition to this a player can play characters and put light spaceships directly into play from his or her hand.&#10;&#10;Spaceships can be divided into many categories: some of them can attack other spaceships, other recover used cards or cover key units from enemy fire, deliver ammunition onto the battlefield.&#10;&#10;Once a player has gathered enough units, he or she can attack their opponent&rsquo;s base. If the player&rsquo;s base is destroyed, the other player wins the game. Another way to win the game is to collect twelve strategic points, produced by strategic objects. The third way includes the defense of the base until the opponent will run out of cards in their deck.&#10;&#10;The creator and designer of the game is Vladimir Kravchenko.&#10;&#10;The first set consists from 110 cards, 55 for each of two factions.&#10;&#10;",

Aided by the Maanen drive, which allows ships to travel exponentially faster between planetary bodies, and humanity's never-ending push for autonomy, the colonies soon became independent planets. In the ensuing wars, both cold and hot, two powers rose to dominance: the Republic of Mars and United Terra. The political and military impasse has existed for much of the majority of the citizens of the system...&#10;&#10;Sol Rising focuses on the conflicts, big and small, of the Sol system primarily involving United Terra and the Martian Republic. You are a Fleet Commander put in charge of the squadrons of your star system. How will you perform your duty when war comes to the Sol system?&#10;&#10;Instead of being tasked with merely destroying the enemy every time, every mission is crafted to have unique experiences and objectives. These include things like capturing the enemy space station with marines, escorting a merchant to safety so he can warn the fleet at the next mission, stealthily avoiding detection to plant rebels on an enemy moon, and more. In some missions, your accomplishments and choices will affect the next, triggering ripple effects that make your play through the campaign unique.&#10;&#10;In Scenario Play, the players will participate in a single scenario pitting one side against another; the winner is determined by victory conditions set by the scenario (ex. the scenario gives the attacking side the mission of wiping out their opponent and to minimize casualties as much as possible, while the other side is trying to get a specific ship to escape the sector and then to take out as many of the attacker&rsquo;s ships as possible).&#10;&#10;Players in a Campaign game participate in a number of scenarios, each having an effect on the next as the story unfolds; the winner of one scenario will have a better starting position in the next (although care has been taken to ensure there will not be a runaway conquest because of this) and the ultimate victory condition is to win the final scenario in the campaign (if the example scenario above was used as a part of a campaign, the second scenario would change based on the outcome of the first; the number of ships the attacker gets and their starting status in scenario two is determined by the ending of scenario one, and if the defender managed to get their special ship out of the sector they get to choose the starting locations of their ships, rather than using a predefined, unorganized starting layout).&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The Battle of Macysburg , a Command and Maneuver scenario, portrays a meeting engagement between two well-matched armies converging on a town that&rsquo;s important as both supply point and road junction. Two players maneuver armies composed of units representing infantry, cavalry, cannon, skirmishers, and leaders, to capture and hold Macysburg, and chase off or destroy the opposing army. The battle lasts for 3 days, 36 day turns divided by 2 night turns.  Units arrive at diverse points on the field during the first 2 days. At night, the armies separate and rally some of the units lost each day.&#10;&#10;Command and Maneuver is a simple abstract strategy rules set that allows very rules-light wargames to be constructed.  But as Macysburg demonstrates, it does not necessarily mean a light wargame. By abstracting all of the &ldquo;fiddly bits&rdquo; of wargames, what gets represented are the basic ideas of command control, supply, and maneuver to obtain both strategic and tactical advantage over your opponent. Since all combat is deterministic, players aren&rsquo;t trying to overcome the randomness of combat results tables or dice towers or card draws. But they are trying to overcome chaos created by the combination of the combat and leader rules, which often result in units being out of command.&#10;&#10;Armies are fragile in this game, and they &ldquo;feel&rdquo; that way. Combat is very bloody and unforgiving. If you are not careful in your dispositions and advances, you can lose a major chunk of your army in a very few turns, without adequate compensation. Players quickly find themselves adopting combined arms tactics and using formations and units in ways that look very much like standard tactics of the era. By doing things very differently than most wargames, the CaM games tease out and examine different aspects of war.&#10;&#10;Macysburg, an abstract riff on the Battle of Gettysburg, is just one of the scenarios you can build with the CaM package, available in a Print and Play and in a Vassal version. The terrain (woods, hills, and town squares) is movable, allowing for a different set-up of the game each time. The elements of the scenario are broken down, laid out, and discussed for players to see how the scenario is constructed and how to vary it. Other scenarios are available and more will be provided. Players are encouraged to experiment with the system.&#10;&#10;",

It is similar to both Othello and Go.&#10;&#10;Players first take turns placing starter tiles (coins) on the game board. Then, they draw a hand of 3 coins, each having a different ability defined by the arrows on the coin. Placing a coin points to one or more other coins not owned by the player, and that player lays claim to those coins by placing a colored token on them. On subsequent turns, claimed coins change hands.&#10;&#10;Once a coin is completely surrounded either by other coins or the edge of the board, it is captured by the last player to successfully claim it. This means a coin captured on your turn could go to an opponent.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all of the spaces have been filled with coins, and all of the coins have been captured. Each coin has a number on it, add those up and the player with the highest score is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "A fast paced action packed motor racing board game based on the Australian V8 Supercar series.&#10;&#10;Simulating all the realism of V8 Supercar racing, players will need to manage all aspects of their car, know when to use fuel, push hard and  jostle for position risking damage to the car. Successful management of fuel, engine condition, tyre wear and brakes is necessary to win the race.&#10;&#10;Players must first setup their car correctly. A wise choice is needed, because once the car is setup, it cannot be changed!  Each setup will determine how fast the car can move around the circuit for each gear. Careful analysis of the circuit will help decide the correct setup.&#10;&#10;Drivers then qualify for pole position and then race begins.&#10;&#10;During the race each driver decides what gear the car should be in for their turn  moves  as per their chosen setup while making some important race winning (or losing) decisions:&#10;&#10;Should I use extra fuel now and push hard?&#10;    Should take this corner faster than recommended and wear my tyre quicker?&#10;    Will I be able the slow down in time to take the next corner?&#10;    How confident is my driver right now, do I have enough confidence to avoid any nasty instances?&#10;    Do I need to pit this lap or can make it around one more time?&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "From the publishers website:&#10;&#10;TARGET FOR TODAY is a solitaire game that recreates American's Daylight Strategic Bombing Campaign against Nazi Occupied Europe during the Second World War. Considerable research, including review of many oral histories gathered from veterans who flew heavy bombers in the Daylight Strategic Bombing Campaign was done to make Target For Today! function as closely as possible to reality. The game was designed to provide YOU, the player, with the ultimate gaming experience depicting the same types of events and decision making processes experienced by our veterans who flew the real-life missions.&#10;&#10;Now, YOU are in command of an individual bomber on an individual mission over Hitler's Third Reich -flying either the B-17F or G Model Flying Fortress or the B24D, or J Model Liberator bomber. A series of individual missions are strung together in the campaign game to form the player's tour of duty. Just as it was in real life, the objective of the game for the player is to survive your tour of duty so you can rotate home.&#10;&#10;The US Army Air Forces suffered one of the highest casualty rates of any branch of the military services including the US Marine Corps during World War II. The heavy bomber groups of the 8th Air Force flew a combined total of 10,631 strike missions over Europe during the period of this game. The 8th Air Force lost 4145 bombers on these missions. Surviving your tour of duty could be difficult!&#10;&#10;TARGET FOR TODAY is an advanced update of Glen Frank's classic game B17, QUEEN OF THE SKIES. Some familiarity with that game is assumed, but &quot;TARGET FOR TODAY&quot; is a completely new game -you do not need to own B-17, QUEEN OF THE SKIES to play it. New tables are included and the rules are organized according to the sequence of play in any typical mission. TARGET FOR TODAY is designed so that each individual mission is fast and easy to play. The campaign game that comprises your tour of duty offers the player a game that is rich in detail, making the game as realistic as possible while still remaining playable.&#10;&#10;In the tradition of B-17 Queen of the Skies, and following in the foot steps of B-29 Superfortress, comes a new solitaire game from Steve Dixon. Bob Best and Shawn Rife Steve Dixon. Tentatively titled &quot;Bombs Away!&quot;, it has been renamed &quot;Target for Today!&quot;. Fly a single mission, a single campaign or fly the entire air campaign from 1942 to 1945 with the 8th or 15th Air Force, piloting either a B-17F, B17G, B24D, B24J and for those so inclined, the YB-40.&#10; The target list will be greatly expanded for the 8th and 15th Air Forces. Enemy planes we plan to provide are the Me-109, Fw-190, Ju-88, Me-110, Me-210, Me-410, He-162, Me-163, Me-262, and Ta-152.&#10;&#10;For more information visit the Consimworld Forum at http://talk.consimworld.com/WebX/.1dd58f17&#10;&#10;Battle Board 11&quot; x 17&quot; (mounted) &#10;Game Counters 176 each .6&quot; 56 each 1.2&quot;&#10;Cards (3&quot;x4&quot;) 5 Bomber Types&#10;Rules Book 44 pages&#10;Chart Book 32 pages&#10;Target Book 56 pages&#10;Flight Manual 24 pages&#10;Crew Boards 5 ea. 11&quot; x 17&quot;&#10;Player Aids 10 ea. 8.5&quot; x 11&quot;&#10;&#10;",

The aim of the game is to come up with the most ridiculous but easy to remember story. Good concentration and focus are two most important things in this game.&#10;&#10;Based on three (or more &ndash; depending on the difficulty level) randomly drawn cards, the players tell absurd, funny, weird or scary stories. The stories have to be unforgettable! The players try to guess which cards will help them create the story. For each good answer you score one point; for each mistake, you lose a point.&#10;&#10;",

There are two pieces of every number and plus, minus and equality signs. Basic idea is to recognize numbers by feeling them in your hand. To prevent you from seeing the numbers, you construct bigger box from the game box and two cardboard walls. Those walls have an hole to put your hand into the box. Hole is covered with cloth.&#10;&#10;Basic idea of the games is to find the wanted number(s) from the box. Some examples: 1. You have to pick up numbers in ascending order. 2. You throw 12 sided die and you have to find two numbers that add up to the result. 3. You pick up a tile with a two digit number and find corresponding numbers. And so on. In most advanced games you have to add or subtract numbers or you have to recognize number sequence.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Claim victory in the Galactic Civil War in Star Wars: Empire vs. Rebellion, a fast-paced card game for two players. In every game, you and your opponent match wits and resources over key events. If you can thwart your opponent, you claim the event, bringing you closer to victory. Whether you seek to triumph through military might, or use diplomacy to achieve your ends, the fate of the galaxy rests in your hands.&#10;&#10;On one side of this galactic battleground are the heroes of the Rebel Alliance. Only rarely can these heroes go toe to toe with the unlimited reserves of the Imperial Navy and Army. Instead, the iconic characters of Star Wars and the unsung heroes of the Rebellion must work in secret, utilizing diplomacy, reconnaissance, and the Force to achieve their aims. Even when the Rebellion deploys its full military strength to win a battle or destroy a key Imperial emplacement, they need the groundwork put in place by Alliance Special Forces.&#10;&#10;Opposing the heroic endeavors of the Rebel Alliance is the massive power of the Empire, led by the twisted Emperor. The dark side of the Force is strong with the Emperor and Darth Vader, and the military might of the Empire is unparalleled across the galaxy. Whether you undertake aggressive negotiations or hire bounty hunters and scum to ferret out Rebel spies, making the Empire the ultimate power in the galaxy rests in your hands.&#10;&#10;To successfully win these struggles and reclaim the galaxy in Star Wars: Empire vs. Rebellion, you will need to utilize all of your resources. Every turn, you can increase your faction&rsquo;s presence at the current event by drawing the top card from your deck and putting it into play. Each resource card you play give you more power and brings you closer to the objective value of the current event. As an example, the resource card shown to the right has a resource value of five, which it contributes to your total resource value while in play. Playing more resource cards may bring you closer to your target, but it also makes your efforts more obvious. If your total resource value ever passes the event&rsquo;s objective value, your forces are discovered and your opponent claims the event.&#10;&#10;Instead of playing a new resource card, you can also trigger the power of a resource card currently in play, exercising the might of the Empire or the cunning of the Rebel Alliance. To activate a resource card&rsquo;s power, you must exhaust it by rotating it 90 degrees clockwise. Once a card is exhausted, you can't use its power unless it becomes ready again. In addition, an exhausted card contributes its exhausted resource value, shown in the lower left-hand corner of the card while the resource is ready.&#10;&#10;",

When opponents land on players owned property, the owning player collects rent from the landing player. Owning sets of properties increases the rent paid to the player who owns them, by the player who lands on the square. The ultimate goal is to have the most money and drive opponents into bankruptcy.&#10;&#10;The classic Monopoly with constructions and other elements from Alton Towers Resort, a theme park in the U.K.; it's celebrating the start-up of the rollercaster 'The Timer'.&#10;&#10;",

You can add &quot;of adult diapers.&quot; Another friend has extreme luck? Stipulate her with &quot;at finding dead cats.&quot; Earn points for coming up with the best and funniest stipulations to beat your friends in the game while stifling their superpowers, crushing their careers, limiting their lifetime supplies, and destroying their dreams.&#10;&#10;Stipulations begins when a player draws a Stipulations card as well as a bonus card and chooses to announce the superpower, occupation, lifetime supply, or fulfilled dream. As soon as the announcement is made, each of the other players has 90 seconds to think up and write down a stipulation, or any condition that makes the announcement worse. For example, if a player announces that they have wings, one player might write &quot;but can't fly&quot;, whereas another player might write &quot;with a 50 foot wingspan that can never be retracted.&quot; All players hand their written stipulations to the player sitting next to the announcer who reads them aloud. The announcer selects which of the written stipulations is the worst (whichever they would want the least) and the player who wrote it collects the stipulations card to keep track of score. The announcer also reveals the bonus point category (Funniest, Most original, etc.) and awards the bonus card to whomever they deem worthy of it based on the written stipulations. The round is then complete and the next player begins as the announcer by drawing a card.&#10;&#10;The game is complete when all players have been the announcer twice. Players should count the Stipulation and Bonus cards that they have earned through game play. The player with the most cards is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Duel of the Magi is a deck-building game that combines fantasy board games, drafting, and TCG fighting mechanics for a complete and unique experience. Players start by choosing one of the four magi classes, each of which have a unique ability to be used during the game. While taking turns players choose sets of spells to include or exclude in the game. Once this phase is complete, the chosen cards of each spell type are then shuffled together and placed on the board in the appropriately labeled spots. Staged face-up, the cards are drafted one at a time from the board as each player builds their own customized deck of spells. Once deck building is complete, the game board is flipped over to the dueling ground side and players engage in a spell casting fight to determine the winner. Part of the dueling strategy is gamesmanship in the form of alliances and negotiations. Do what you must to ensure you survive to the end.&#10;&#10;",

The players take on the roles of noble lines during the Swedish Empire Era. Together, they will populate the kingdom, build ships for overseas trade, build armies for overseas war and build forts for defending the gains. Instead of fighting each other, they will have to fight the enemies around the Baltic Sea, competing for the same provinces. However, the best for the kingdom is not necessarily the best for your noble line. You have to decide what benefits you most: production or trade, consolidation or expansion, war or peace. But will your objectives coincide with your opponents' objectives? Beware, if you fight internally, your external enemies will conquer the entire kingdom and put an end to both the Swedish Empire Era and the game!&#10;&#10;Game mechanisms include&#10;&#10;1. Player balance: The players have a limited number of units, preventing one from growing too strong. &#10;2. Game balance: The rate that the enemies grow is related both to the number of players and to their current strength, preventing them from getting too strong or too weak. &#10;3. Production vs Trade vs War balance: The players may choose different strategies for growing and one strategy chosen will bring negative effects to the other strategies. &#10;4. Cooperation: The players build fleets, armies and forts together and they also fight battles together. &#10;5. Prisoners' dilemma. One player may benefit by not cooperating but if all do so, all will lose.&#10;&#10;",

And the farther you get into the game, and the madder your cultists get, the less chance you have of the dice actually showing the results you need.

After that you just roll and move throught chosen department. All the spaces in the departments sell one special thing and you just buy it. If you roll five or six, you take a random card and you either get money, or things or loose money. When you come back to Lobby you sell all the things you bought with random prize (from zero to two and half times the buying prize) decided by the dice.

With your fleet of powerful spaceships, enter the zone of battle in which Frigates, Destroyers, and Battleships compete tirelessly under your command for supremacy over the known universe.&#10;&#10;Fleet Commander: 1 &ndash; Ignition is a space battle game with miniatures for two players. Each player controls a fleet of seven ships on a 5 x 5 checkered board, which may integrate terrain features such as asteroid fields. In turn, a player chooses three dice among his Command Dice, throws them, and either acts according to the outcome or saves the dice on his Command Bridge for the following rounds. There are dice to move, attack, and put energy into the shields.&#10;&#10;Fleet Commander: 1 &ndash; Ignition has been designed to make epic space battles easy to play and to enjoy without having to remove the living room table, acquire many miniatures, or learn complex rules. The whole atmosphere of such battles is transcribed here in one &quot;small&quot; box with a simple but deep game system and beautiful miniatures.&#10;&#10;It features a high replayability -- and with a modular board, six special weapons to equip the Battleships, advanced and optional rules, and four scenarios -- no battle will be the same.&#10;&#10;The game system of Fleet Commander: 1 &ndash; Ignition is flexible and allows for expansions, with multiple ones now available.&#10;&#10;&#10;For more detail on the latest evolution of this game, see Fleet Commander: Genesis.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Players then take turns moving along the streets and alleys, even entering the buildings that serve as a &quot;stash&quot;.

Special pieces move faster than others or scare away all opponents before disappearing themselves.&#10;&#10;Inspired by Lu Zhan Jun Qi, a Chinese game that has proven its excellence for many years, Speakeasy requires memory and anticipation in games full of bluffing.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Victory Under Sail (VUS) is a quick-playing miniatures game of fleet naval battle during the last century of the age of sailing warships.  It is designed for a small number of players to recreate the larger battles of this era in a reasonable time.  It is not an overly simple game, but it is designed to have simple and quick mechanics to speed play.&#10;&#10;Each side has a fleet of ships (represented by counters or miniatures) subdivided into squadrons.  VUS is based on squadron maneuvers rather than individual ship movement, although each ship is individually moved within the requirements of the planned maneuver.  The movement system uses a true 12-direction movement system on a hex grid that is unique among games of this genre.  Squadron maneuver cards and random event cards recreate the challenges of command &amp; control of a fleet of sailing warships.&#10;&#10;VUS uses a &ldquo;Hordes o&rsquo;Dice System&rdquo; for combat that is based on the use of different types of dice to represent various types of cannon batteries.  The dice mimic the results of a traditional combat results table without the need to reference charts.&#10;&#10;The game includes more than 30 scenarios from 3 wars.&#10;&#10;",

Players take turns drawing cards and placing them in a row in front of them.  When a player has a Poochie card at one end and a Fastball card at the other end, she is out of play.  The remaining players continue play until they have also completed their ropes and dropped out of play.

        "description": "Game Play Variants: There are 2 game play variants of the game, 1 vs 1 and the free-for-all 3 way battle. The Recommended Variant is the 3 player free-for-all game which is the basic setup of the game's gameplay. The game can be played 1 versus 1 which will still use the play mat and will still use the unit positioning area such as the left/right flank unit placement.&#10;&#10;Game Objective: Reduce all opponents&rsquo; Leader life Points to zero.&#10;&#10;Game Setup:&#10;&#10;1. Select Race Players choose which race they wish to play and thoroughly shuffle their decks. Pass each deck counter-clockwise to next player for reshuffling until it goes back to the designated player.&#10;&#10;2. Place Leader Card Each player must place their leader Card in the field (playmat designated area). A Leader Card starts with 30 Health Points. (If a leader&rsquo;s life points drops to zero, that player is eliminated from the game).&#10;&#10;3. Determine Play Order    Randomly select which player will go first. After the first player&rsquo;s turn, player turn order will resume in a counter-clockwise direction.&#10;&#10;4. Draw Hand Cards    All players must draw 6 cards from their chosen deck. Every play turn, players can draw 2 cards in their library. All players can assign up to 2 cards on the mining placement area which will produce 1 gold per card per turn. The more cards assigned to the mining area, the more gold it produces. However, re-assigning the cards/using the cards from the mining area has an additional cost of 4 gold. It is the penalty for the cards being re-assigned as unit in the field.&#10;&#10;5. First Turn    The first player begins their turn and performs the actions described in the Play Sequence section of these rules.&#10;&#10;Game Play Sequence:&#10;&#10;These are all the actions a player may perform during their turn. Each action must be completed in the order designated below. In a free-for-all game, the player chosen to go first takes their turn. Next, in a consecutive order (going in a counter-clockwise direction), the other players will fulfill their turns.&#10;&#10;1.    Re-draw (Optional) A player can elect to declare a Re-Draw action at the start of their turn. This action is performed in place of any of the regular actions associated with a typical turn. When a player has no useful cards in their hand, they can choose to use the Re-draw action. The Re-Draw action allows a player to discard their hand of cards and draw 6 new cards from their deck. This action ends their turn. The player is not allowed to take any more actions, and will not be able to produce any Gold until their next turn. Note: If you don&rsquo;t need to Re-Draw, skip this action and take a normal turn. Simply begin your turn with the collect Gold action and precede through the subsequent action steps until you wrap up your turn with the Upkeep action.&#10;&#10;2.    Collect Gold Collect the amount of Gold equal to the total Gold on all of the cards placed on the mining area.&#10;&#10;3.    Draw Card Draw 2 cards from your Race deck.&#10;&#10;4.    Activate Cards This action lets you establish and activate any type of cards, use    Command cards, and/or assign new units.    During this play sequence, a player may perform all four of these options: - Play 2 Card to the mining field. Note: All cards in the mining field should be placed facedown. - Play any number of Passive and Instant Command Cards.    - Play any unit cards to assign any number of new units on the left/right flank.&#10;&#10;5.    Re-assign Once the unit is re-assigned from mining area to any of the field flank, it cannot go back to the mining area. However, once a unit is assigned to any flank, you can re-assign it the other flank with a cost of 2 gold.&#10;&#10;For further information of the game's &quot;How to play&quot;, please download the game's Rule Book.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In Dragon Run, the players have just raided a dragon's keep, picked up a bunch of loot, and awakened the dragon. Now it's time to flee, ideally making it out with both our treasures and our lives.&#10;&#10;On each turn, a player can either advance boldly, flee cautiously, or cry like a baby. If you advance boldly, you draw a card from the location deck, which holds three types of cards: one that allows that player to either redraw or stop, one that grants new treasure from the treasure hall, and (of course) the dragon. If you draw the dragon, you lose one health point (out of two), the dragon calms down (i.e., it loses one temper point), and the location deck is reshuffled. If you're injured twice, you die and are out of the game.&#10;&#10;When fleeing cautiously, you first discard a treasure worth at least one coin, then roll a d10. If your roll is higher than the number of cards in the location deck, the dragon calms down, then you reshuffle the location deck; otherwise you must draw a card from the location deck just as when someone advances boldly. Your sacrificed treasure is still lost.&#10;&#10;When you cry like a baby, you don't draw a location card, instead discarding a treasure worth at least two coins. Having shown your obeisance to the dragon, the turn passes to the next player.&#10;&#10;Players start with four treasure cards; while some cards are worth 1-5 coins, others provide a one-shot potion or a talisman that stays in effect until the location deck is shuffled, which ends the round. Gameplay lasts from 5 to 8 rounds. Each player has a unique power that can be used once per round: the thief can steal cards from opponents, the cleric can heal opponents in exchange for treasure, etc. If the dragon loses its final temper point, the game ends and whoever holds the most valuable treasure wins; if all of the adventurers are charred to death first, then the dragon wins instead!&#10;&#10;",

He will either pass to another position, kick for a field goal or try and gain ground. On the other 4 dice, there is a 1 in 6 chance of 'busting' the line of defense, at which point, your opponent has one more roll of the 'Defensive' die to try and stop the try scoring effort. &#10; If he succeeds, it is recorded as a tackle in the set of 6 and the attack continues. If he can't stop the try, the attackers then gets to roll the TRY / NO TRY dice.&#10; 3 in 6 chance of a TRY / 2 in 6 chance of NO TRY and 1 chance the VIDEO ref is called upon to review the tape - in which a re-roll of the TRY die is made.&#10; You can also kick for field goals, penalties and scrums. All of these are dependent on rolling a certain number to be successful.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "From the publisher:&#10;&#10;Pocket Basketball has all 5 player dice on the court with the Referee die, a Defensive set die and a standard six sided dice for shot accuracy. Depending on if your player is OPEN or the defense has double teamed him, will change how easy or hard it is to score.&#10;&#10;Games consist of 5 min quarters, or however long you wish to play.    There are dice for each of the five court positions, plus 1 die for defense, 1 die for referee and 1 die for shot accuracy.&#10;&#10;At tip off, both players roll the D6 with the highest roll winning possession.  Every play begins with the PG being rolled first. He will either PASS to a team mate, SHOOT for 3pts or DRIBBLE&#10;&#10;PASSING from the PG will be to the team mate shown by a letter. You can pass as many times before the SHOT CLOCK times out.    &#10;Each other player has a PASS option which they can CHOOSE which player to pass the ball to. The CENTRE and SMALL FORWARD have a special ability after they pass, however, it can only be used if the receiving player takes a shot on his next action.    &#10;&#10;    CENTER - Pass/tip in - if the player that receives this shoots and misses, the player can roll again to try and meet the DEF level as a tip in attempt    &#10;    SMALL FORWARD - Pass/rebound - if the player that receives this shoots and misses, the player can roll again with the SF die as the rebound was made    &#10;&#10;&#10;If either of these two pass, and the receiving player also passes, the tip off/rebound are no longer able to be used.&#10;&#10;SHOOTING - when a type of shot is shown on a player's dice, this indicates he is attempting to score. Your opponent will then roll the DEFENSE die to set his defense. Depending on the DEFENSE level, the SHOOTER must roll equivalent or above to score a basket.&#10;&#10;DRIBBLE - just reroll the same dice again. If you roll DRIBBLE 3 times before you take a shot, the shot clock has timed out and it's a turnover to your opponent's PG&#10;&#10;UNCONTESTED SHOT - except for your PG, all 4 other team mates have a special shot indicated with a STAR. The DEFENSE can not roll and the Shooter scores an automatic basket.&#10;&#10;DRAW - when rolled on the DEFENSE, means a FOUL has occurred on the shot. If the shot is good, the player will go to the free throw line for an extra point chance.    If the shot misses, the player then goes to the line for either 2 or 3 FREE THROW attempts.&#10;&#10;FOUL - when rolled on the DEFENSE, your opponent will roll the REFEREE dice to determine the infringement. Travel/Dbl dribble/Charge are all Offensive fouls and result in a TURNOVER to your opponent's PG.    Personal/Flagrant foul results in a stop in play and restart by the OFFENSIVE player's PG&#10;Ball up - both players roll their dice to see who gains possession from the jump.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "INTRODUCTION&#10;&#10;Futuristic game of missions and agenda for two to three players set in a dystopian CyberGlam city hovering in the upper atmosphere.&#10;&#10;Players are leaders of different factions vying for control of the hovering city of Lithica.&#10;&#10;GAME OBJECTIVE&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to complete missions that allow you to realize your faction's agenda. Doing so allows you to expend resources in order to add buildings, statuary, bill boards, and groups throughout the city. These installations expand your influence, giving you control of city sectors.&#10;&#10;The first player to control a predetermined number of city sectors wins the game.&#10;&#10;ENACTING AGENDA&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player selects a faction-oriented Agenda Card to put into play. This is called enacting an agenda.&#10;&#10;Agenda Cards list five different types of Missions your agents must complete. Once they have completed three or more different missions from the list, the agenda is considered realized, and you are awarded a specified number of Influence Points. These points can then be spent on placing installations on the game board.&#10;&#10;COMPLETING MISSIONS&#10;&#10;Mission Cards list five different types of Actions our agents must complete while in neutral- or enemy-controlled locations. Once three or more different actions from the list are completed, the mission is completed. You gain the listed benefits from the mission, and the Mission Card is then placed face-up under the Agenda Card (for scorekeeping purposes).&#10;&#10;COMPLETING ACTIONS&#10;&#10;Each agent in the game has a primary function; such as: eliminating, seducing, capturing, corrupting, or turning enemy agents. To perform its function, an agent must be in a city sector, or sector location, that contains a keyword matching the same keyword on the agent's card.&#10;&#10;CyberPsi utilizes polyhedron. An action attempt may require you to roll 1d4 or 1d12 to determine how many Action Points an agent musters when attempting the action. Asset Cards that are equipped to the agent sometimes adds to an action attempt's Action Point total.&#10;&#10;Thus, a Rank 1 Hacker in a location with the keyword INTERFACE may try to &quot;Steal (1) Data Card from target enemy Database.&quot; The Action Point Value needed to successfully perform this action is (12). In order to be able to reach this, you roll 1d8 (as indicated on his card) and add (2) Action Points provided by his &quot;Jac-in-Boxx&quot; Asset Card and (1d4) Action Points provided by his &quot;Virtualization Headgear&quot; Asset Card. The total number of Action Points your Hacker gets is (13), which exceeds the target value of (12). Thus, the action attempt is successful, and your agents enables you to take anyone Data Card from the target player's Database.&#10;&#10;RESOURCES&#10;&#10;During the course of the game, you will assign agents to undertake activities that generate resources. You can then expend these resources to put other agents into play, to buy Asset Cards, and to unlock cards that can be placed into your draw deck.&#10;&#10;COMBAT&#10;&#10;Combat in CyberPsi is resolved by rolling each combatant's die type (d4, d6, d8, etc), adding any modifiers provided by Asset Cards, and comparing the results to each other. Damage is determined and applied, and the battle continues or ends, depending on combat situational factors.&#10;&#10;Some agents have Combat Abilities that impact attack order, targeting, and damage.&#10;&#10;",

On your turn you roll a dice and move a beaver. If he comes to a tree field, he may take the tree in his stock or build it in the lodge. Two Beavers on marginal fields carry out a turf war: This is decided with dice: who rolls higher wins. The winner can take a tree in the lodge or a tree as a food supply from the loser. Who first completes his lodge and fills his sfood supply wins.&#10;&#10;",

Carefully researched, tested, trialled and refined, TAOC Christian offers new angles and avenues to think about, and discuss, Christian faith and life.&#10;&#10;Louise Howland and Keith Lamb, authors of the original best-selling titles, TAOC The Art of Conversation, have collaborated for this special edition with Ross and Suzette Bowerman.&#10;&#10;With 300 Christian Communication-builders ranging from the profound to the light-hearted, plus a comprehensive Christian Communication Guidebook, TAOC makes it easy to share and discuss feelings, ideas and experiences related to faith and religious living in a harmonious way.&#10;&#10;Like all TAOC editions, it&rsquo;s not a quiz &ndash; and whilst there are myriad of opportunities to learn, it&rsquo;s never about who knows the most. Rather, it&rsquo;s a communication tool that draws on personal experiences, thoughts and reactions to facilitate fascinating discussions and new insights. It also encourages clear communication and respectful listening.&#10;&#10;TAOC is a handy icebreaker when a new group of people come together and helps people who already know each other take their relationships to new levels. Ideal for small groups, bible study, fellowship, education and the home, TAOC can be played by family, friends, workmates, students or even solitary players. TAOC is suitable for players aged from four to 104.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "To the Ends of the Earth is a fully-cooperative adventure game based on the 1930's adventure serials. Players take on the roles of intrepid explorers traversing the globe in search of ancient artifacts while trying to outwit and outrun enemy agents.&#10;&#10;The game begins with the players choosing a mythical artifact, which will serve as the McGuffin for the game. Each artifact will have a series of clues that are distributed around the world.&#10;Clues take several forms: They can be excavation sites, scraps of historical documents, ancient relics, or even people who may be able to help the players deduce the location of the artifact. Each clue that is collected brings the players on step closer to discovering the artifact&rsquo;s final resting place. Players will have to act fast as enemy agents (controlled by the game) will be hot on their heels collecting clues and setting ambushes at every turn!&#10;&#10;Combat in EotE takes the form of action sequences, or confrontations with the enemy villain that happen periodically throughout the game. Players work together to defeat enemy minions by using their weapons, special abilities, teamwork, and most importantly, the environment around them. Furniture such as crates, explosive barrels, tables, and even bottles of whiskey can be used and manipulated by the players to give them the upper hand in any battle. Find yourself staring down the barrel of a Tommy Gun? Flip over the nearest table for cover! Cornered by a band of hired muscle? Grab the nearest whiskey bottle, set it alight, and toss it at an explosive crate to create the perfect getaway!&#10;&#10;To the Ends of the Earth is the board game where you, the players, truly determine the course of your adventure! Fight vigilantly to defeat the enemy villain, recover the artifact, and win the game!&#10;&#10;EotE features a unique Action Dice allocation system to determine the options available to each player during their turn. Each player will choose an adventurer to control for the duration of the game. Each adventurer has three &quot;stats&quot;, which determine their proficiency for different tasks:&#10;&#10;Brawn determines a character&rsquo;s Strength, Speed, and Endurance, and is used for physical tasks such as brawling, climbing, or using melee weapons.&#10;&#10;Skill describes a character&rsquo;s Dexterity, Coordination, and Awareness. Using firearms, disarming traps, and driving vehicles are made much easier with a high Skill Stat.&#10;&#10;Wits relates to a character&rsquo;s Intelligence, Problem-Solving, and Inter-Personal skills. A high Wits Stat is needed to conduct research, excavate dig sites, or issue commands to allies and other characters.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each turn, a player will roll their available Action Dice (five six-sided dice if their character is healthy). Each die rolled below a Stat may be used for an action that requires that Stat.&#10;&#10;Actions include movement, researching artifacts, brawling with enemies, using firearms, or manipulating the environment. Special abilities and equipment broaden the choices available to each player, and with so much potential to strategize, there is never a &lsquo;bad roll&rsquo;. Every action you take will have consequences that ripple through the rest of the game, creating a unique adventure each time you play!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;From the Hanging Gardens of Babylon to the Pyramids of Egypt, and without forgetting the Greek Parthenon, The Builders: Antiquity &mdash; a standalone card game based on The Builders: Middle Ages &mdash; offers a whole range of challenges to its builders. To face these challenges, you must put on your foreman clothes. Between hiring workers, managing their organization, purchasing slaves or tools, and taking out loans, you'll have to make the right decisions to fulfill your dream: Becoming the greatest builder the age has ever known.&#10;&#10;In the game, players score points (and gain money) by completing the construction of buildings. Each building has four characteristics &mdash; carpentry, masonry, architecture, painting &mdash; rated between 0 and 5, and the workers have the same characteristics valued in the same range. To complete a construction, the player must add enough workers to cover the four characteristics of the building, but placing a worker on a construction site costs money.&#10;&#10;Each turn players have three free actions; however, for an added cost players may also chose to buy additional actions during their turn. Unlike in The Builders: Middle Ages, players can acquire slaves and put them to work, but if they don't pay to free the slaves by the end of the game, they lose points. Other changes from the original game include the ability to send your workers to universities or purchase tools to improve their characteristics.&#10;&#10;Make use of your workers, of your slaves, or your freed slaves to build your buildings and amass victory points to ultimately be named the greatest builder of all!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "About the Game&#10;&#10;M.I.N.D is a tactical strategy board game set in a sci-fi setting in which players are in control of a colony and have to manage and expand it while facing different crisis and invaders. M.I.N.D can be played solo or in two players, but also with up to four players with the help of an extra copy. The goal is to build your colony and complete the set of five achievements required by the game before the last turn ends and players can do this by cooperating or competing one with each other.&#10;&#10;Players build new sectors, train new citizens and manage their command to do as many actions as they can to maximize production of credits, influence, equipment or overpower while also progressing. The game requires lots of planning since there are many things that can intervene and ruin your plan if not paying attention. Players interact and can either help or sabotage each other. Units can be sent to start fires, break structures, close doors, start an epidemic or even unpower structures. To resolve all these players need to assign command to their units and use them to repair, build or interact with different things from the colony. Players can improve their units by equipping them with items or assigning them influence thus enabling them access to the faction's unique super power.&#10;&#10;If you like strategy games, games that can be played solo, games that have confrontation or simply that let you cooperate with a friend while facing a great challenge then M.I.N.D may be the perfect choice for you.&#10;&#10;",

Acquire Spirit Points to win! Defend yourself with the help of Angels! Demolish your opponents with twelve different Demons.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with an equal number of Character Cards, 4 Orb Cards, 1 Angel and 1 Demon. The board is set with 5 Orb Cards to draw from, and the rest of the Orb Cards are placed to the left of the pool. There are Black, Red, Blue White, Green and WILD Orb Cards. Black &amp; Red Orbs can be used to purchase Demons. Blue &amp; White Orbs can be used to purchase Angels. Green Orbs are used to by Action Cards, and a combination of all 5 colors gets you a Gate Key.&#10;&#10;On a players turn, they may choose to do one of the following actions: 1) pulling Orb Cards 2) spend Orb Cards 3) Attack a player&#10;&#10;You obtain Spirit Points by: Purchasing Angels and Demons, going through Gates using Gate Keys and White Orbs, buying Action Cards (some of them are just Spirit Points), or Battling other players!&#10;&#10;In a battle, the attacking player uses their Demon Cards and the defending player uses their Angel Cards. Each player starts with 10 hit points. Players take turns rolling dice to try and damage the other player. 5's and 6's are hits wile 1-4 miss. Angel and Demon Cards consist of either Battle Cards that last for the entire battle (i.e. Armored Angel - You cannot be hit by 5's) or Attack Cards that are played before a player rolls the dice (i.e. Fire Demon - On your next roll, 6'd hit for 2 damage). The first player to bring their opponent to zero Hit Points wins.&#10;&#10;Finally, the Character Cards in the game all give slight advantages and manipulate all of the mechanics listed above!&#10; Now...Bow your head, say your prayers, and prepare for Spiritual Warfare!&#10;&#10;",

In this game you play the role of one of the crew members on board the space ship Liberty. Your job as a Mover is to jump from planet to planet in the system picking up and delivering cargo. Movers specialize in getting cargo to its destination as efficiently as possible. As you deliver cargo, you are rewarded with resources that are needed to keep the Liberty flying. But you must do this without drawing too much attention from the Universal Oversight.&#10;&#10;Universal Oversight (UO) is the government elected by the planets to police the system. The UO watches all movement through the system in an attempt to keep order. Over time it has become corrupt and evil. UO Scouts are sometimes dispatched to chase down and interrogate Movers that have been spotted delivering cargo. They are looking to confiscate anything that might be a threat to the UO&rsquo;s power. If you draw the eye of the UO too often, your job will eventually become impossible. You and your fellow players must work together to deliver cargo, avoid UO Scouts and quickly handle any Events that pop up along the way.&#10;&#10;To win the game, you need to complete a set of five Objective Cards. These cards directly continue the story that begins in the included graphic novel Finding Liberty. (A 20-card random objective card deck will also be included with the game. Players can choose 5 cards from this deck for a fresh experience each game)&#10;&#10;- Unique Dice-Rolling Mechanic&#10;How the dice are rolled-Space Movers handles dice-rolling to complete skill checks in a whole new way. Rolls take place inside the game box on a specially designed roll board. Dice are rolled one at a time instead of all at once. For each skill needed in the check, 1 die will be rolled needing a 5 or higher for success. Since the dice are rolled 1 at a time into the box, players are encouraged to strike dice already rolled in an attempt to change the result as needed. After all the dice are rolled, one last roll is made using the blank 6 sided die. This signals the end of the skill check and is a player&rsquo;s last attempt to change any previous die results.&#10;&#10;- Comic Book Included&#10;The story begins in the Comic book &ldquo;Finding Liberty&rdquo; that will be included with the game. Objective cards that match the Comic continue the story as you play the game.&#10;&#10;- Game Soundtrack &#10;Listen to the official game soundtrack on your computer or smart phone.&#10;&#10;",

Two to four players take on the roles of scientists working quickly to repair these worlds&rsquo; connections to their past, present, and future by making new time strands &mdash; however, every repaired connection ripples through time and fuels the Quake to fracture more worlds. When the storm&rsquo;s power fades, the most successful scientist will be hailed as a hero throughout the multiverse.&#10;&#10;Paradox takes familiar board game elements such as card drafting, set collection, and resource management, then adds a Bejewelled-like grid of colorful disks for each player to manipulate, along with a universe of worlds that must be protected by game&rsquo;s end. As a result, Paradox presents players with a unique experience that is simple to learn yet challenging to master as players navigate three interlocking systems to protect these worlds from the chaotic forces of the Quake.&#10;&#10;Paradox is designed by Brian Suhre and is illustrated by 15 artists, each with their unique view of one of the worlds. Paradox plays in about 20-30min per player.&#10;&#10;",
