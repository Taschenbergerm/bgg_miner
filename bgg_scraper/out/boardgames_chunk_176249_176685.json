Players compete to complete contracts by selecting contracts from the Market and by collecting fish from their fleet at the wharfside. It's what happens when the fleet comes home!&#10;&#10;Tales of the bountiful harvest at Ridback Bay have traveled far, attracting merchants to the local wharfside who wish to pay handsomely for your haul. A successful fisherman&rsquo;s day is not done with the catch; keen business decisions will determine if your fleet has amassed a rich profit! Merchants have offered generous contracts for the catch, but which offer the greatest benefits? Choose and complete the most lucrative contracts and reap your reward!&#10;&#10;In Fleet Wharfside, players fulfill Contracts from local Ridback Bay businesses. Each turn, players will either collect fish from their fleet at the wharfs (by taking cards) or choose to purchase a Contract from the Market. Contracts provide a bonus while in play, but once they are completed the bonus goes away too! The player who collects the most VP from Contracts, Trophies, King Crab, final Goods, and their Captain Bonus wins the game!&#10;&#10;Fleet Wharfside is game #8 of the E-G-G Series!&#10;&#10;",

Will your Sailfish, with a Clownfish Tail, poisonous Lionfish pectoral fins, and Anglerfish Light Node, followed by a school of fish he commands, be the last Master Fish alive? Or will your Great White Shark, with the spiked skin of a Puffer Fish, over-sized brain, and regenerating heart be the last fish swimming by leaping from the water with its Flying Fish wings for a diving sneak attack? The possibilities are endless!&#10;&#10;With Octo, Fantasy, Reptile, Guppy, and Mech expansions also available, there's no reason that your Giant Squid with the wings of a Pegasus and claws of a dragon can't claim victory through use of torpedoes from inside its tortoise shell. Each time you upgrade your fish's body or add new parts, it becomes more powerful, lives longer, and gains new special abilities!&#10;&#10;Life under the sea just got much more interesting!&#10;&#10;",

Not only were the Saxon king and his followers contending with more Viking incursions, but with a rebellion among the native Britons, who sought to take advantage of the King&rsquo;s woes by seeking to carve out their independence amidst the mayhem. Players familiar with the first volume of the series will be able to quickly get into this game. Each copy of Alfred the Great, Volume II is composed of the following:&#10;&#10;One 11 by 17 inch hex map&#10;Two sheets of 286 single-sided, un-mounted counters&#10;Three cardstock Battle Boards (one Briton, one Saxon, one Viking)&#10;One Players&rsquo; Aid Sheet&#10;8 pages of rules&#10;&#10;",

Then he rolls the die, and moves his pawn. Whichever card he lands on, he must follow the instructions on it. He ends his turn by discarding a card, forming a discard stack.and shall finally again a card beside the stack. Players may never have more than 5 cards in hand at the end of a turn. The play continues in a clockwise direction. Whoever rolls a 6 may roll again.&#10;&#10;The card-types that form the board:&#10;&#10;A Chair:&#10;All players need to move one place to the left and leave their cards behind.

        "description": "LEXI Card Game is a new word game. There are 55 cards in one deck of LEXI Card Game. There are 52 letter cards; the number of each letter of the alphabet in the deck is according to the frequency of usage for each letter in the English language. There are two WILD cards which may be substituted for any letter of the alphabet. There is one (shortened) Rules/Score card.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, the players set a goal of whatever score to be reached to win. (The winning score may be 100, 200, 500, etc.) Every player takes turns dealing. All players get nine cards each at the beginning of the game. One card is flipped open next to the deck, and both are placed at the center of play. The first player draws from either the deck or the opened card, but not both. He may lay down one or more words to be scored at the end of the round; he does not have to lay down any words. When this player is done, he discards one card. Play moves to the next player. All players will take turns playing. When it is a player's turn, he either draws one card from the deck or pick up card(s) from the open discarded pile. If the player draws from the discarded pile, he has to pick up all the cards from the card he wants to the latest discarded one and take it (or them) into his hand. This player has to play the bottom (oldest discarded) card he picks up and spell a word with it. He can, but does not have to spell words with the rest of the letter cards he picks up. When this player is done laying down words in front of him, he must discard one card. A player may add to an existing word he has laid down in a previous turn--by adding a prefix or a suffix--to form a longer word. For example: A player has laid down &quot;ALL&quot; in one turn, and has &quot;E&quot;, &quot;R&quot; in his hand. In a subsequent turn, he picks up &quot;T&quot;. This player may add to the existing word, &quot;ALL&quot; and form &quot;TALLER&quot;. A player may only play and add to his own words and no one else's. For words to count toward a score, the words must be laid down in front of the player during his turn. If the words are not laid down when the round ends, those letters (forming a word) left in a player's hand will not count toward scoring. Moreover, one (1) point will be deducted for every letter left in a player's hand. All players must have taken at least one turn to spell words before the round may be ended. Only the player whose turn it is may end the round. To end a round, a player must use all his cards to spell one or more words, except one which must be discarded. Scores are added up according to the Summation principle:&#10;&#10;1 letter word = 1 point; 2 letter words = 1+2= 2 points; 3 letter words = 1+2+3= 6 points; 4 letter words = 1+2+3+4= 10 points; 5 letter words = 1+2+3+4+5= 15 points; 6 letter words = 1+2+3+4+5+6 =21 points, etc.&#10;&#10;The players play a new round and add up the scores. Rounds are played until the set score is reached. The first player to reach the set score wins.&#10;&#10;",

All you have to do is play your cards right and best those other cats!&#10;&#10;The cats all start with the same cards: 1 Catch, 2 Stalk, 1 Play, 1 Steal, 1 Taunt, and 1 Eat. No luck of the draw here, it's entirely up to you! Get as many enjoyment points as possible and win the game! Be clever and anticipate what the others will do so that you can claim victory. Each player will target another cat and a location where a bird is hanging out. They will then select their actions for the 2 rounds of action. All of the cards are revealed simultaneously, they get resolved and when the smoke clears, some cats may have birds and some may not.&#10;&#10;The birds will hang out at the bird bath, in the grass, on the fence or in the trees. The bigger birds will need to be stalked before catching them and you will have to time everything just right. Once you do catch your bird you will have a choice to either press your luck and play with the bird to double its enjoyment point value or to just eat it. The longer you play with it the greater the chance of it being stolen by another cat.&#10;&#10;Taunt cards allow other cats to distract you and cancel your actions, nothing is safe in this back yard!&#10;&#10;",

Players move along a winding pathway (hence the &quot;wind&quot; in the title) and attempt to locate (the &quot;find&quot; in the title) items related to summer vacation. For example, a player could land on a space requiring the kid to locate four flip-flop sandals.

The result is a very addictive game that is easy to learn and will be played over and over again.&#10;&#10;Every player starts with a specialist role and an ID (either Government Informant or Rebel Fighter). At night the Informants reveal themselves to one another &mdash; assuming any exist, that is, as at all player counts between zero and three Informants are in play &mdash; then all players complete their specialist action in a clockwise order (removing the need for a rigid script/app and reducing the potential to accidentally reveal your role). Specialist actions include gathering information, switching roles, and helping players in their attempt to identify the Informant(s) before the day is over. If a majority of players identify an Informant, the Rebels wins &mdash; but if the Informant(s) remain hidden, they win!&#10;&#10;",

From there players will place tiles and begin to venture out to the newly discovered Islands.&#10;Proceeding clockwise from the starting player, each player takes their turn in full.

Each player has four architects numbered 1-4 and on a turn, a player places an architect next to a row or column in the grid, claims the tile that's as far in as the number of the architect placed (e.g., the fourth tile in for architect #4), places that tile in the appropriately numbered row or column on the player's 4x4 city board, then claims any resources associated with the tile (inhabitants or energy).&#10;&#10;When a player takes a tile, a figure is placed in this now-empty space and the next player cannot place an architect in the same row or column where this tile was located. In addition, you can't place one architect on top of another, so each placement cuts off play options for you and everyone else later in the round. After all players have placed all four architects, the round ends, all remaining tiles are removed, and the tiles for the next round laid out.&#10;&#10;After four rounds, the game ends. Players can move the inhabitants and energy among their tiles at any point during the game to see how to maximize their score. At game end, they then score for each of the six types of buildings depending on how well they build their city &mdash; as long as they have activated the buildings with inhabitants or energy as required:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Residential buildings score depending on their height&#10;    Shops score depending on how many customers they have&#10;    Public services score depending on the number of districts in your city that have them&#10;    Parks score depending on the number of residential buildings next to them&#10;    Harbors score based on the longest row or column of activated harbors in the city&#10;    Factories score based on the number of adjacent shops and harbors&#10;&#10;&#10;Some buildings are worth victory points (VPs) on their own, and once players sum these values with what they've scored for each type of building in their city, whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

The New world is yours for the taking, but beware there are other ambitious adventurers who would dare try and take what is rightfully yours. Forge your own destiny and make history on The Spanish Main!&#10;&#10;In Cutthroats, you and up to five other players vie for control of key towns in the Spanish Main. Players utilize one of seven skills to attack each other's ships and towns.&#10;&#10;Ships move by use of a 12 sided die. But players can only move in certain directions on the board, which can be changed after reaching a port. Players that land on another player's port must pay port fees to that player or try to conquer the town.&#10;&#10;Combat takes place when a player passes another on the high seas and decides to attack. Each player rolls a 10 sided die and adds to that number, the number of cannon upgrades they have. Best two out of three wins the fight. Losers are forced to lose an upgrade, and pay a ransom to the victorious player as well as being sent to the nearest town.&#10;&#10;Players are eliminated if they owe more doubloons than they have in their hold. Last player with money wins. A secondary way of winning is to conquer all five towns and hold them for a full round of play.&#10;&#10;",

Many lives that were cut short by violence or tragedy resume here fighting each other in a nightly battle to gain the strength to move on while fending off the attacks of rival factions. Asphodel is a strategic skirmish game set in the afterlands.&#10;&#10;Factions of ghosts fight over locations to gain enough resolve to move on. These locations exist as shadows of places in the world of the living. In the afterlands locations may be adjacent to other places that are actually many miles apart in the living world. Set up -----Each player begins by either choosing or randomly drawing one of the available factions:&#10;&#10;The Drowned, whose lives were cut short by tragedy at sea, or perhaps at the bottom of a well.&#10;&#10;The Burned, victims of fires, radiation, and explosions. Their connection to the fire has lasted into the next world.&#10;&#10;The Gremlins, tinkering souls who lost their lives to the machines they still love.&#10;&#10;The Mystics whose pursuit of knowledge and power has become even greater on the shadowy side of the shroud.&#10;&#10;And the Poltergeists whose violent brutal ends leave them raging, and lashing out across the asphodel meadows and possibly beyond.&#10;&#10;Players take turns moving their Ghosts, who are represented by dice. Ghosts will be banished, and summoned back to Asphodel. Ghosts may find the resolve to transcend this purgatory, scoring points for the player or they may find themselves stuck in Asphodel, wandering the twilight city forever.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The zombie plague has struck the local college campus. Only a handful of brave cheerleaders are still fighting the endless wave of old comrades and professors turned into hungry, brainless creatures.&#10;&#10;Zombies vs Cheerleaders  is an asymmetrical two-player game in which one player controls the cheerleaders while the other player controls the zombies. The goal of the cheerleaders is to defeat all the zombies, while the goal of the zombies is to devour one of the cheerleaders.&#10;&#10;The cheerleader are standing behind barricades and have powerful hand-made weapons and can attack with a certain strength. However, each time they attack, they lose energy. Once they run out of energy, they are knocked-out. Zombies have two characteristics: strength and protection. When they are hit by an attack greater than their protection they are removed from the game.&#10;&#10;On their turn, the players have three actions they can spend to move their team or to attack. By killing bosses, cheerleaders can obtain special actions, while zombies can do the same by destroying the barricades.&#10;&#10;The game uses illustrations made specially for the game by the design team of the comic book series &quot;Zombies vs Cheerleaders&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

That's something we thought while working on Thrash n'Roll.&#10;&#10;Each player commands a chosen metal band. During the game, players train their band members, give concerts in the club, record albums, give interviews, compete for the fans, avoid scandals, etc. Over 6-8 turns, players have to gather as much fame as possible to win. The game is crowned with the big concert and ThrashAwards ceremony for the best musicians, albums and singles. The game mechanisms are based on dice and cards.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "From the publisher's website:&#10;&#10;This is the world's only American Civil War espionage game. It allows the players to spy for the south and see if they can influence the war. In the first scenario they try to steal the plans of the Monitor. In the next scenario it is 1863 and they get to try and influence the outcome of the Battle of Gettysburg. The last scenario is in 1865 and involves a fellow named John Wilkes Booth.&#10;&#10;This is an Engle Matrix game of moderate complexity. Players take turns moving character tokens on a map to set up scenes and create sections of the narrative. Each addition to the story is evaluated in terms of how likely it is to happen and how well it fits with the overall story. This evaluation determines the number that needs to be rolled for the new segment of the story &quot;to happen&quot; and to be added to the main narrative.&#10;&#10;The player who contributed the most significant elements of the story is the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;",

Cards are played to a common discard pile, which can be captured by matching its top card or playing a jack. Points are scored for sets of two or more equal ranked cards played to the common discard pile: two equal cards are a mitaine (mitten), three cards are a gant (glove), and four cards are a chausson (sock).&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player plays one card to the discard pile. If he plays a Jack or a card matching the top card of the discard pile, he captures the pile, which may be worth points, if it contains the ten of diamonds.&#10;&#10;Alternatively, a player may call a mitten, glove or sock. If he does so, he plays the first card of his combination. The next card is played on his next turn, etc. When he completes his combination, he scores points for that combination. When a combination has been called, the discard pile cannot be cleared. However, other players can steal the combination by calling a higher combination (which is either a larger combination or a combination with higher cards). If such a player completes their combination, they score both their own combination and any combinations they have stolen.&#10;&#10;Multiple hands are played until a player (or team) reaches 500 points; that player (or team) wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

On their turn, each player places one of their god&rsquo;s followers on one of the buildings in the village.  Each god has the same two types of followers: Tsukumogami (Spirit Objects), household items possessing a soul that animates them and Zashiki-warashi (Kid Ghosts), playful child-like spirits.   Each follower has a strength value and once a building has five followers placed on it, the total strengths of each god&rsquo;s followers placed there are then compared.  Spirit Objects have a number that represents their strength, while Kid Ghosts have strengths that can vary through powerful special abilities which are triggered by the arrangement of other spirits at the same building.  If the strength of your faction is greater, you place one of your god&rsquo;s possession markers on the building.  Using clever placement of your followers to better capitalize on each Zashiki-warashi&rsquo;s special ability is key to victory in Fan and Mallet.  The first player to place all seven of their possession markers wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Sin may not seem like anything severe at first, but watch as the Sins pile up in front of you. Forgiveness, Christian Character, and Recall will aid at discarding your Sins. To win, everyone must be without Sin at the end of the game. Don't hold onto your Sins in secret as the Hypocrites do. Accept the Rebuke and be made new.&#10;&#10;WHAT IS A REBUKE AND WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT?&#10;When most hear this word they apply a negative connotation, however it is quite the opposite. To rebuke means to correct someone in a loving manner. God the Father gives us the 10 Commandments and His word as a rebuke.&#10;&#10;Great to play with:&#10;&bull; Ministries&#10;&bull; Bible Studies&#10;&bull; Families&#10;&bull; Friends&#10;&bull; Churches&#10;&bull; Academy Classrooms&#10;&bull; Anti-Bullying School Programs&#10;&bull; Road Tripping&#10;&bull; Game Nights&#10;&bull; Camping&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Grexit is a card driven competitive game in which up to 4 creditor countries (USA, Germany, Russia and China) vie for contol over the valuable resources of the debtor country (Greece) through economic pressure and by enforcing policies.&#10;&#10;Each Creditor country has it's own special ability that affects it's balance in the game, while the Debtor country draws a &quot;political party&quot; card to determine what kind of government is in power (left, center or right, each with it's own special ability). All the players draw a hidden objective card which will give them their own personal agenda to fullfill. These agendas will most of the time lead to conflict of interest between the players. Objectives can be for example: to control the most of one kind of resource (eg. oil deposits, natural gas), to own public utilities or services of general interest (eg. Power, Water or Telecommunications) or to save the country (preventing the country from either falling apart in revolt or declaring bankruptcy) or ruining the country (to end the game before the 8th turn).&#10;&#10;The game begins with each player drawing hidden objective cards&#10;Each turn, an event card is drawn, which will give flavor to the game as well as affect the policies and actions taken during that turn. &#10;Then, the players controlling the creditor countries, draw cards from the &quot;Memorandum&quot; deck and choose which policies they'd like to have adopted by the debtor country. In order to entice the Debtor, they offer the policies face down with a bribe card face up. Bribes can be either money or relief measures which give victory points and breathing space respectively to the Debtor player.&#10;&#10;Memorandum policies enforced are now laws and are placed on the board. There are various categories of policies, such as budget cuts, salary reductions, etc.&#10;&#10;The Debtor player may reject a Creditor's offer and hidden measure card but that will enable the Creditor to play a &quot;pressure&quot; card which usually has a negative effect on the Debtor.&#10;&#10;While these policies are in effect, they provide victory points to the Creditor that proposed them, until a relief measure card of the same category is played which generally negates the policy card removing it from the game and depriving the policy's owner from it's victory points.&#10;&#10;However, the creditors have a greater goal in mind. The country is rich in resources and properties which, while controlled, also provide victory points to their owner. To own a property, a creditor needs to pass privatisation policies, through which, he exchanges the debt owned to him for one or more properties.&#10;&#10;That said, after a certain point in the game, there is a delicate balance to be maintained between happiness/unhappiness and the ever growing debt.&#10;&#10;Enforcing measures has impact on the Debtor country, which sees it's people's happiness dropping and it's Debt rising. Should the people's happiness reach 0, the people rise up in revolt. Should the Debt reach it's maximum point, the Country declares bankruptcy. In either case, the game will end. Otherwise, the game ends in 8 turns. After the game ends in any of the afore mentioned ways, the players compare their victory points to declare the winner.&#10;&#10;As a general rule, in order for the creditor player to earn victory points, he needs to control properties and to fullfill their hidden objectives to win the game, while any debt owed to him by the debtor player by the end of the game will be lost. On the other hand, the debtor player earns victory points from the bribes accepted, from the properties that remain public, from the happiness of his people (if any) and from the level of the debt (if he hasn't declared bankruptcy).&#10;&#10;",

The landscape of Isle of Skye is breathtaking and fascinates everyone.&#10;&#10;In the tile-laying game Isle of Skye: From Chieftain to King, 2&ndash;5 players are chieftains of famous clans and want to build their kingdoms to score as many points as possible&mdash;but in each game only four of the sixteen scoring tiles will be scored.&#10;&#10;Thanks to the scoring tiles, each game is different and leads to different tactics and strategies, but having enough money is useful no matter what else is going on. Managing that money can be tricky, though. Each turn, each player places two area tiles in front of them and sets the selling price for the tiles. Setting a high price is great, but only so long as someone actually pays the price because if no one opts to buy, then the seller must buy the tiles at the price they previously requested.&#10;&#10;In the end, the player with the best kingdom&mdash;and not the richest player&mdash;becomes the sovereign of the island.&#10;&#10;",

The dungeon is formed out of a circle of dungeon wall tiles, with dungeon cards filling most of those spaces and heroes filling the rest.&#10;&#10;A day lasts three turns, and on a turn, you play an action card from your hand, normally moving your hero around the circle of cards (skipping over other heroes) and claiming the card on which you land, which could be treasure, a monster (which wounds you before you defeat it), a trap, or even a magic item. Cards are worth various amounts of awesomeness, and you want to be the most awesome hero at the end of the third day.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The Great War is now just a distant memory in the minds of all but the eldest among us. Battles led to the splintering of the people living around The Shining City while one faction remained: the Hazimin. The Hazimin have done what they can to keep their still-glistening tower standing tall. However, though their monumental home in the center of the city is still impressive, their numbers are few. Even as new generations grow to power, the ruins of Dubai are at the heart of all conflicts among the factions of the wasteland. With the ruins still standing as a beacon of what once was &mdash; and a promise of what could be again &mdash; the new leaders of each faction (the Hazimin, the Bahriyyin, the Tayyarin, and the New Badu) have decided it is time to reclaim the city and become the leaders of Dubai.&#10;&#10;Power over the city will be decided by the people, and only with that power can one faction establish their dominance. As your faction's leader, it is up to you to turn the ruins of the diamond of the desert into a new home for the people &mdash; but your control must outreach that of other factions to ensure that you rebuild the ruins in your image and rule the reformed city of Dubai!&#10;&#10;Dubai: Rebuild the Ruins combines a unique thematic flavor with worker placement, tile-laying, and resource management elements in a game set in 2299 for 2-4 players. By using roundels for worker placement, players are constantly engaged in the game with little downtime as turn order is always changing. This allows for multiple player interactions as one player's turn often involves reactions from other players. The setting is additionally unique, but draws closely from the buildings of the modern day city of Dubai. In the end, the faction that has rebuilt the most of the city rules Dubai!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Xenon is a valuable noble gas that is found in very trace amounts in Earth's atmosphere. Due to the difficulty and expense of isolating high-purity Xenon for various technological advancements in recent years, the need for Cryogenic Distillation of Xenon is on the rise.&#10;&#10;Xenon Profiteer is a highly thematic, deck-deconstruction, euro game for 2-4 entrepreneurs in which each player takes control of their own Air Separation Facility and distills Xenon from their Systems to complete lucrative contracts. You will also physically expand your facility by building upgrades, pipelines, and acquiring new contracts and connecting them to your Center Console.&#10;&#10;In a decidedly different take on the classic deck-building format, Xenon Profiteer not only actively encourages players to remove cards from their decks, it is absolutely essential in order to isolate Xenon. Each turn begins by strategically removing cards from your hand (and deck) through Distilling based on the real-world hierarchy of elements. The goal: only have Xenon remaining in your hand. The problem is, of course, the only way to gain more Xenon, is to bring in more AIR. And AIR is composed of all kinds of other pesky elements that make isolating Xenon difficult.&#10;&#10;To combat this, you will need to Buy powerful upgrade cards for your facility in order to become more efficient. These upgrade cards can either be purchased for a lower cost and placed into your system (deck) or installed directly to your facility to be used every turn for the remainder of the game. Or maybe, if you are low on funds, you might decide to place a Bid Token onto an important Upgrade or Contract, thereby giving yourself a discount on a future turn and causing other players to pay YOU extra if they decide to purchase it instead.&#10;&#10;After a player has either completed five contracts or installed five upgrades, the game end is triggered and the player with the most Xenon points is the winner.&#10;&#10;Do you have the ingenuity, strategy, and tactical fortitude it takes to be recognized by several reputable business publications as the owner of the most influential domestic supplier of Xenon?&#10;&#10;",

You get to choose your own team (from a set of 14), then equip them with a custom arsenal, and train them with maneuvers. The last team standing is the victor.&#10;&#10;The game's combat/gameplay is governed by &quot;the Flow&quot; - every action you take in Ophidian Wars is either positive (+) or negative (-).  Positive actions allow to you retain control and continue making further actions, while a negative action transfer control (Flow) to your opponent.   Learning how to best manipulate the Flow while managing your team's field position and resources (Cheer and Adrenaline) is crucial to winning.&#10;&#10;If you enjoy minis, all 14 beta set gladiators are available for 3D printing and painting, high detail resin, 54mm.

        "description": "This is a brand new concept for traditional card games. In this game, the cards are colorful particles and the table top is an active collider slamming them into each other for the betterment of science. Experimental patterns called Waveforms are placed into the collider in an attempt to break them down into readable samples. Depending on the strength of the collisions you might get the harmonization of a perfect sample, or the particles might cause an explosion, scattering random particles around the collider and possibly ending the experiment too early.&#10;&#10;This game comes with rules for both solitaire and multiplayer games for up to four players. Both versions of the game play very similarly. At the beginning of the game you pick a Waveform, which is a pattern of face up and face down cards played to the table. At the beginning of a player's turn they play one card from their hand by placing it face up onto the table. Once the card is played, the collider engine begins to run.&#10;&#10;The collider engine is a set of rules that cause the cards on the table to interact. The highest numbered card located at the bottom of the Waveform will search for the lowest numbered card it can interact with (based on suit). If it finds one, it will pull that lowest numbered card to itself and they will merge into a new number (by adding their numbers together), then one of four different reactions will occur based on that new number. Once that reaction is done, the collider engine begins searching for another possible interaction, and keeps doing so until there are none left, which ends the turn.&#10;&#10;Players score points by collecting cards based on some of the possible reactions. In the solitaire game the object is to score well while trying to clear all of the cards from the Waveform. The multiplayer version is all about getting the highest score through multiple rounds of play.&#10;&#10;",

Using the basic mechanics of Chess, there's an additional layer of strategy due to each card entering play hidden from the opposing player's view.&#10;&#10;On their turn, each player flips a face-down card so it is face up, and then moves any face-up card. He or she then announces check, if applicable. If no check is announced, then a card is placed face down, and a new card is drawn from the deck. If you can set traps and lure your opponent into making mistakes, you might be able to snatch their King and ransom him for control of the kingdom!&#10;&#10;This deluxe version contains all the cards in the original King's Ransom game, plus an additional 10 new piece types, 110 new cards (for a total of 160), and instructions for a four-player variation.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "INTRODUCTION: OUTPOST WAR is a solitaire game of the battles for the Hills and Ridges along the Main Line of Resistance (MLR) during the later stages of the Korean War (1951-1953). The player assumes the role of a commander of an Infantry Company during its grueling and miserable turn manning a Hilltop Outpost before they are relieved. As the Company Commander, you are responsible for securing your Sector of Front by successfully taking enemy positions and defending yours with the least amount of casualties. Although there are many support units available to you, they may often times be limited to you by political, logistical or geographical obstacles. You have the choice to play as a US Marine, US Army, French Army, Foreign Legion or British Commonwealth Infantry Company.&#10;&#10;GAME OBJECTIVE &#10;The objective of OUTPOST WAR is to successfully survive a Tour in the Hilltop Outposts along the MLR in Korea. A Tour consists of a number of Rotations manning an Outpost on a Ridge or Hill. The Player can play a Short Tour (1 Rotation), an Average Tour (2 Rotations) or a Long Tour (3 Rotations). Each Rotation consists of making a Rotation Deck of 20 &ldquo;Outpost Life&rdquo; Cards and once all Outpost Life Cards have been drawn and resolved, the Rotation is over and the Player totals his Rotation VP and adds it to his Tour VP. Once all Rotations have been completed, the Player totals his Tour VP and then compares it to the Victory Determination Table to determine the level of success.&#10;&#10;OUTPOST WAR can be found at the following URL:&#10;http://www.berserkergames.net&#10;&#10;",

This year&rsquo;s mark has been carefully selected, and Constable Cramphorn is hot on our trail. And did I mention that you should watch your back? After all, stealing from a Society member is just as entertaining as fleecing a mark. So, do you have the lightest fingers, the snappiest patter, and the most disarming smile...or is this the year when you get nicked?&#10;&#10;Scoundrel Society is the first Small Box/Big Fun game from Action Phase Games where players take on the role of a member of The Society, a gathering of notable con artists who come together once a year to show off their craft by proving who can steal the most loot from the mark without getting caught. Loot is lifted from the mark by playing one of five action cards, most of which work best when played alone. But tread carefully: while many pieces of loot have unique abilities that can affect the game, each carries a suspicion value. So when Constable Cramphorn is revealed from the last ten cards of the loot deck, the player with the highest suspicion score is apprehended, leaving the rest to compare the value of their ill-gotten gains to determine who is the most dirty and rotten of the Scoundrel Society.&#10;&#10;",

Will it be YOU?!&#10;&#10;One of the Small Box/Big Fun line of games from Action Phase Games, Ninja Camp pits animal martial artists against one another in a training exercise where the best will become the personal ninja apprentice of Sensei Saru. Each player starts with two cards, each representing a ninja skill, with the rest of the deck making up the game board. By using the cards in their hand, players navigate the board, adding new skills to their hand as they do&mdash;and leaving fewer movement options for their fellow campers. Each player also has a unique ninja ability that he can use once per game to try to turn the game in his favor. A game that sets up and plays in thirty minutes or less, Ninja Camp is sure to provide hours of fun for families and future ninjas!&#10;&#10;",

They may also leave action markers with another player (steal from him or her). When a player has no action marker left, he or she leaves the game board. When all but one have left, the round ends. Players place and draw new cards where they have placed their action markers, shuffle and resolve them. The game ends when an object is fulfilled. A murdered player is eliminated but may still win by identifying the murderer.&#10;&#10;Mingle &amp; Murder has a player elimination mechanism with a unique twist: the eliminated player may avenge his or her death by identifying the winner (the murderer) and claim the victory!&#10;&#10;",

In this game, you will stretch your imaginative and logical mind to crack the secret behind the Code Machine. Come unlock the genius within! The product is a beautiful fusion of a word game and a logic game. Its interactive game-play makes it a great piece for friends and family pastimes. The difficulty levels are controlled by players, so it is also a nice adult-child educational toy. Something special about this product is that it features a patented word coding method that is unique, but easy to understand. So while enjoying the fun and challenge, players can gain knowledge of vocabulary and coding.&#10;&#10;Easy to learn. How to play ... &#10;Step 1: Draw two game cards to determine the &quot;Word Type&quot; and &quot;Spelling Condition&quot; of the secret word to be formed. Reveal the two cards to all players. &#10;Step 2: One player uses the chips to form a secret word by the method illustrated on the Code Machine. Cover it with all windows closed. &#10;Step 3: The other player(s) must crack the secret word with as few windows opened as possible. Ask questions wisely for hints in the process. The player that requires less windows opened is the winner.&#10;&#10;&#10;In a two-player game, one player is the Encoder, the other the Decoder. The Encoder forms a secret word by the method illustrated on the Code Machine using the information from the &quot;Word Type&quot; and &quot;Spelling Condition&quot; cards, starting from the farthest left position, in correct spelling sequence, and announcing the number of letters in the word. In each round, the Decoder opens one small window at any position and attempts to name the secret word. In each game, the Decoder has a total of three changes to ask the Encoder a yes-or-no question for a hint. The questions can be used all at once or separately. When the secret word is cracked, count the number of windows opened. Switch roles and repeat. The player who required less open windows to decode the secret word is the winner.&#10;&#10;In a three-player game, one player is the Encoder and the other two players are the competing Decoders. The Decoders take turns opening windows and attempting to crack the secret word. The Decoder who successfully cracks the secret word first is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Format: In development; board wargame and VASSAL module.&#10;&#10;A Glorious Chance is a solitaire wargame that puts you in command of the U.S. or British naval squadron on Lake Ontario in the critical summer of 1813.&#10; You have four months to dominate the lake. But each patrol, each convoy mission, each amphibious landing you make to pursue victory risks full-scale battle with the AI squadron &ndash; a battle that could leave you triumphant or shattered in a matter of hours. A dynamic card-driven AI opponent assigns enemy missions, refits and launches new ships, and plots raids on your supply routes and coastlines.&#10;&#10;Your objective: Control Lake Ontario by the end of the summer campaign, without losing your own squadron. The AI squadron's strategic objectives and battle tactics react dynamically to your moves.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: Make decisions about ship missions and assignment zones. Scout and shadow enemy forces to identify them. Intercept detected enemy forces. Make amphibious assaults. Attack and defend supply convoys.&#10;&#10;What's special about this game:&#10;&#10;1. The only operational age-of-sail game that&rsquo;s below monster size, playable in approximately four hours, and requires no specialized knowledge of ship-handling or period tactics.&#10;&#10;2. This campaign has never before been the specific focus of a wargame. (To the extent that it appears at all in wargames, it&rsquo;s either been part of a full-war strategic game, or a small scenario within tactical naval games that cover the general Napoleonic period.)&#10;&#10;",

It is a game for the whole family, easy to learn, with a fast gameplay and two bonuses for the bravest pirates.&#10;&#10;L'Isola del Tesoro is a basic roll and move game, where you are trying to get from the Start tile to the Treasure Island, progressing through all the Sea tiles placed in a line. On your turn, you roll the six-sided die and move as many spaces as the result of the roll. You flip the tile where you land and apply any effect indicated (move forward one space, move to the tile where stands the last ship, skip your turn...). The first player to reach the Treasure Island wins the game.&#10;&#10;The Monster tiles are used to block your progression. When you cross one, you must stop, flip it and stop your turn. On the following turn, you roll the die to try to beat the monster. Whoever beats the monster gets the tile, which doesn't give any advantage.&#10;&#10;",

If your pawn is larger or equal as the pawn before it, you can pass it with a high die number.&#10;If your pawn is smaller than the pawns on your way you have to stay behind it.&#10;&#10;Each pawn can throw out each opponents pawn if the pawn reaches exact the position of it. This is independent of their size.  &#10;Some fields are marked. If a pawn hits one of the marked fields, the disk is turned with all pawns on it. The new position is reached, when the players pawn is on the next marked field.&#10;There are only some single links between the circles and only 1 link from the inner circle to your Destination.&#10;&#10;Therefor the rotation of all pawns may move them nearer to the destination or they have to run a full round again because they were moved on the wrong side of the link.&#10;&#10;",

Each player leads a faction of survivors with dozens of different characters in the game.&#10;&#10;Dead of Winter is a meta-cooperative psychological survival game. This means players are working together toward one common victory condition &mdash; but for each individual player to achieve victory, he must also complete his personal secret objective. This secret objective could relate to a psychological tick that's fairly harmless to most others in the colony, a dangerous obsession that could put the main objective at risk, a desire for sabotage of the main mission, or (worst of all) vengeance against the colony! Certain games could end with all players winning, some winning and some losing, or all players losing. Work toward the group's goal, but don't get walked all over by a loudmouth who's looking out only for his own interests!&#10;&#10;Dead of Winter is an experience that can be accomplished only through the medium of tabletop games. It's a story-centric game about surviving through a harsh winter in an apocalyptic world. The survivors are all dealing with their own psychological imperatives, but must still find a way to work together to fight off outside threats, resolve crises, find food and supplies, and keep the colony's morale up.&#10;&#10;Dead of Winter has players making frequent, difficult, heavily- thematic, wildly-varying decisions that often have them deciding between what is best for the colony and what is best for themselves.&#10;&#10;",

Each round, the players battle it out with merchant vessels and other ships, trying to grab as much loot as possible. One player takes dice from all the players, rattles them in their hand, then tosses them into the game box to resolve the battle. Where your dice land in the box, in addition to the symbols rolled, determines the results of the battle, then players claim their loot. Players may now return to port to upgrade their ship, hire new crew, or give their goods to the Pirate King for his favor.&#10;&#10;When upgrading their ship, players use physical pieces to assemble their vessel, making each ship look different. In the box are dozens of punchboard pieces to customize your ship. In addition to common items and crew members, there will be unique item upgrades and crew that can make your ship stand out among the crowd!&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the player who earned the most favor from the Pirate King wins!&#10;&#10;&#10;*Note: Per the publisher, unfortunately there's a misprint in the components list in the rulebook:&#10;&#10;The correct numbers of Loot tokens in the box are:&#10;10 Spices&#10;18 Rum&#10;18 Fabrics&#10;10 Valuables&#10;&#10;Also, the correct number of Special Loot cards from the mini-expansion is 5 (not 8).&#10;&#10;",

These people have telepathic abilities, which allow them to read the minds of others and exchange and extract memories from there.&#10;&#10;Every year, the greatest of these Mind Masters meet in a battle for sanity. During these tournaments, they try to bring the most precious memories of each opponent into the foreground, so that they can access and delete these thoughts forever. Only the ones who keep these hidden until the end will stay sane.&#10;&#10;Mind Masters is a competitive card game, where each player has an identical 40 cards deck at the beginning. Inside these decks, there a five &quot;Precious Memory&quot; cards, which each player has to protect. They will play cards forcing the others to discard or even trash cards, to finally remove all of their &quot;Precious Memories&quot;. Therefore, the deck gets thinner and thinner over game play. The last player keeping at least one of his &quot;Precious Memories&quot; wins.&#10;&#10;This game was created for the March 2015 24h design contest at BGG (theme: confusion).&#10;&#10;",

Some players may get an extra card. Cards in players hand are always kept hidden from other players.  Any cards making pairs are laid down in front of players at this time.  Compass cards are not used at this time.&#10;&#10;Game Play: The player to the left of the dealer draws one card from the dealers hand.  If a pair is made, the pair is laid down immediately.  The person now offers cards to the player on his/her left.&#10;&#10;Compass Cards:  The compass cards are &quot;reverse&quot; cards.  If the person who is about to draw holds a compass card, he/she may place it at the center of the table, and then draw a card from the player on his/her opposite side.  The order of offering cards reverses until another compass card is played.  The game play direction may change up to 3 times as each compass card may only be used once.  If a player draws a compass card from another player, it cannot be used until his/her next turn.  When there are two players, a player may play a reverse card instead of drawing.&#10;&#10;",

Players succeed in their quest by hiring and developing groups of characters that can accumulate resources and exercise unique abilities. Players collect resources from the game board through character actions and spend them to hire new characters and advance their tribe.&#10;&#10;Stratos has 5 character classes, each serving a distinct function. The 5 classes and their (promoted forms) are the Peasant (Cultivator), Archer (Marksman), Soldier (Knight), Explorer (Swashbuckler) and Mage (Sorcerer). Each promoted class gains expanded abilities compared to its original version. Enhanced abilities include greater attacks (Knight vs. Soldier), access to stronger spells (Sorcerer vs. Mage), improved resource harvesting (Cultivator vs. Peasant), expanded movement (Swashbuckler vs. Explorer) and increased attack accuracy (Marksman vs. Archer). Characters move from space to space on a tile-based board which can be arranged randomly or according to set maps. Each character can perform up to 2 unique actions per turn with movement being a repeatable action. Available character actions (dependent on class) include Harvest, Travel, Search, Attack, Shoot, Defend, Cast and Use.&#10;&#10;Points are awarded by defeating characters, casting unique spells, discovering treasures, hoarding resources, promoting characters and occupying key map locations.&#10;&#10;The first player to reach a pre-determined number of Prosperity points (default 10) is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;Stratos is a product of Board and Tale Games Inc., a Canadian boardgame publisher based in Hamilton, Ontario.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Rocket Fist! Form Galaxy Sword! Omicron Torpedo, fire! Giant robots battle in the style of your favorite Japanese cartoons.&#10;&#10;Duel Bots is a card game that lets you design your own deck, load up a giant robot with high-tech components and devastating weapons, then duel head-to-head or in a multi-player death-match.&#10;&#10;Duel packs contain two pre-constructed decks. The decks in Galaxy Sword are designed for new players to learn the game. Once you're familiar with the rules the cards can be used alone or with other duel packs to design your own custom deck.&#10;&#10;-- Game play summary --&#10;&#10;Design your own deck of 32 cards or use a pre-constructed deck from the duel pack. There are three type of cards: components (such as weapons or other gear), resources (which focus on hand management) and damage cards. Damage cards go in a separate pile and you draw them when your robot takes damage. When your damage pile is empty, you lose.&#10;&#10;Each turn you may put one component into play from your hand into one of 7 available slots. This sets the pace of the game. Components get more powerful as the game goes on: Tier I components can be played right away but aren't very powerful. You must have 3 components on the table to play a more powerful Tier II component. When 6 of the 7 slots are filled you can play your signature component. Each deck has exactly one signature component, and once they start hitting the table the game will end soon. This follows with the giant robot theme, where mega-weapons tend to decide the battle after some back and forth with smaller attacks.&#10;&#10;Damage cards first go into available component slots; you can't play a new component into a damaged slot. You may also put damage on a component on the table, which keeps you from using that component until the damage is removed. Some cards let you move damage to the discard pile where it will eventually cycle back into your hand, so that's just a temporary fix. If instead you pay the cost listed on the damage card you can remove it from the game. There are 5 different kinds of damage with 5 different costs, so choosing compatible damage cards is an important part of deck design. You also choose how many damage cards to use (8 to 12) but the total is always 32 cards, so choosing more &quot;hit points&quot; reduces your available number of components and resource cards.&#10;&#10;The game has elements that limit the luck factor present in all card games. Certain resources let you choose cards from your discard pile, others from your draw pile. The small deck size ensures you will see your whole draw pile several times each game. (The discard pile shuffles to form a new draw pile when it's exhausted.) Luck plays a factor in which components come out first and in occasionally finding yourself without a component to play which can put you a turn behind.&#10;&#10;",

The player to have played the highest card receives the &quot;major blessing&quot;, all other players to have played any cards with a value greater than 0 receive the &quot;lesser blessing&quot;.&#10;blessings can have all kinds of effects, ranging form players directly gaining points by gaining dice or adding points to their dice, but also performing actions like stealing other player's dice or exchanging dice with other players.&#10;When all god's blessings have been resolved play continues with the next round of bidding.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Rocket Fist! Form Galaxy Sword! Omicron Torpedo, fire! Giant robots battle in the style of your favorite Japanese cartoons.&#10;&#10;Duel Bots is a card game that lets you design a custom deck, load up your giant robot with high-tech components and devastating weapons, then duel head-to-head or in a multi-player death-match.&#10;&#10;Duel packs contain two pre-constructed decks. Mix and match the cards to build hundreds of possible custom decks. Compatible with Galaxy Sword and all Duel Bots duel packs.&#10;&#10;-- Game play summary --&#10;&#10;Design your own deck of 32 cards or use a pre-constructed deck from the duel pack. There are three type of cards: components (such as weapons or other gear), resources (which focus on hand management) and damage cards. Damage cards go in a separate pile and you draw them when your robot takes damage. When your damage pile is empty, you lose.&#10;&#10;Each turn you may put one component into play from your hand into one of 7 available slots. This sets the pace of the game. Components get more powerful as the game goes on: Tier I components can be played right away but aren't very powerful. You must have 3 components on the table to play a more powerful Tier II component. When 6 of the 7 slots are filled you can play your signature component. Each deck has exactly one signature component, and once they start hitting the table the game will end soon. This follows with the giant robot theme, where mega-weapons tend to decide the battle after some back and forth with smaller attacks.&#10;&#10;Damage cards first go into available component slots; you can't play a new component into a damaged slot. You may also put damage on a component on the table, which keeps you from using that component until the damage is removed. Some cards let you move damage to the discard pile where it will eventually cycle back into your hand, so that's just a temporary fix. One card (Repair Bot) moves damage back into your damage pile at the cost of some resources, but in many cases you will need to pay the cost listed on the damage card to remove it from the game. There are 5 different kinds of damage with 5 different costs, so choosing compatible damage cards is an important part of deck design. You also choose how many damage cards to use (8 to 12) but the total is always 32 cards, so choosing more &quot;hit points&quot; reduces your available number of components and resource cards.&#10;&#10;The game has elements that limit the luck factor present in all card games. Certain resources let you choose cards from your discard pile, others from your draw pile. The small deck size ensures you will see your whole draw pile several times each game. (The discard pile shuffles to form a new draw pile when it's exhausted.) Luck plays a factor in which components come out first and in occasionally finding yourself without a component to play which can put you a turn behind.&#10;&#10;",

The Jokers need to be distinguished as strong (&quot;red&quot;) and weak (&quot;black&quot;).&#10;&#10;The cards are ranked from the strong Joker, weak Joker, all the twos, Aces, Kings etc down to the threes. There is no difference between cards of the same denomination. Jokers are completely wild and can replace any card in forming a meld. Twos are partly wild and can be used to represent a card of equal denomination to another. Twos can never be used in a single sequence.&#10;&#10;The object of the game for all the players is to discard all their cards. The dealer initially leads and can play any meld. Players wishing to play must play the same number and type of meld, but higher ranking (e.g. a pair of fours above a pair of threes) or they may pass. It is not compulsory to play cards if a player can do so. Play continues until all players pass. The last person who played can then proceed again with any meld he chooses. If the player who played last goes out (and all the other players have passed) then the player to his left proceeds.&#10;&#10;The dealer shuffles the cards and deals them to his left (any cutting of the cards is entirely optional and is left to the choice of the dealer). All the cards are dealt and there should be 11 cards for all players except for the dealer who has 10. In the first hand the dealer is chosen at random, usually the first person to turn up a Jack.&#10;&#10;Pits is a corrupt version of the Chinese game Zh&#196;&#147;ng Sh&agrave;ngy&oacute;u.&#10;&#10;",

It's a game that have the spirit of Pong hau k&rsquo;i or Tic-Tac-Toe; it's a little abstract that can be solved but that you can play with your children, or in a pub with casual gamers, because the original idea was to make it on a coaster. You need a little board game and only ten coins, that forms two towers of five coins each.&#10;&#10;Players build two towers, five coins each tower. Each player places, per turn, one tower on an empty space on the board.&#10;&#10;The first turn is for the player who placed the first tower on board. Per turn each player moves any tower one or two cells on the same row or column, without changing direction. When a player moves a tower can carry as many coins as he wants to the target cell, but he must leave at least one coin in the origin cell. The target cell must be empty and in his movement the tower cannot jump over other towers or other coins. Every move will create new towers, which can be moved in next turns. A tower consists of at least two coins. A coin on a cell cannot move, but can block the movement of other towers.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player on his turn cannot move a tower. The player who made the last move is the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;",

Genius or GYUMI Genius) to maximize your score!&#10;&#10;To set up the game, shuffle the fruit cards, then create three face-down decks of approximately equal size, then turn one card face up to start a discard pile. The deck contains fruit cards of seven types, with six types of fruit (coconut, papaya, fig, avocado, pineapple, and pomegranate) being numbered from 1-5 while passion fruit is numbered 1-7. The ratio of identical cards differs by fruit type.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you take one of two actions: Draw the top card from one of the decks, or draw the top card from the discard pile. If you draw from a deck and don't want the card, place it on the discard pile. Otherwise, start a pile with that type of fruit or place that card on top of any other cards of that type that you already have. (Thus, you can have at most seven piles.) Splay the cards in each pile upward so that you (and everyone else) can see how many cards of each type you've collected, but with the number of only the topmost card of each pile being visible. If the discard pile is emptied because people keep taking the cards, flip over one card to start a new discard pile.&#10;&#10;When all three decks have run out, the game ends once the player holding the final card discards it or adds it to their collection. Players then score points for each type of fruit they've collected, but fruits score only from 1 up in consecutive order. If you have 1-2-3-4-5 of pineapple, for example, you score 11 points, whereas if you have 1-2-4-5 of fig, you score only 3 points since only the 1-2 count. If you fail to get a 1 in a fruit or you duplicate a number in a fruit sequence, then you score 0 points for that fruit!&#10;&#10;Some cards have special colored numbers on them, and with these you can create a cross-fruit sequence as the coconut has the 1, the papaya the 2, and so on. As long as these &quot;genius&quot; numbers are in valid fruit sequences, then you'll score points for this genius sequence, too. Whoever scores the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",
