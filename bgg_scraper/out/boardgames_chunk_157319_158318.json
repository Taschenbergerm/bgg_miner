        "description": "Dice Brewing is a dice-building game in which you manage resources and brew beer to become the beer master. &#10;The players become brewers whose goal is to acquire the resources needed to brew many new beer recipes and then gaining the rewards that come with brewing them - gold and mastery points. To do so, each player uses their player board and two location cards (marketplace and black market) to develop their resource pool and stock their storage with certain tokens that alter the course of the game. The player who has the most mastery points at the end, wins the game.&#10;Players will have to prove themselves by brewing various styles of beer, acquiring specific malts and hops, as well as enhancing the recipes with ingredients that will make your beers stand out. But that's not all... The Apprentices will be able to compete with each other directly, making their lives harder by using some unrefined methods!&#10;&#10;Players manage their resources by way of 6-sided dice in 4 different colors:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Light malt: yellow dice&#10;    Dark malt: black dice&#10;    Hops: green dice&#10;    Skill: blue dice, which allow for additional effects on recipe cards and resource dice.&#10;&#10;&#10;Players can influence the luck of the dice through a variety of cards that allow them to replace the dice, increase the value rolled, receive extra dice, buy special ingredient tokens, and buy action tokens - which can affect opponents or provide additional dice manipulation.&#10;&#10;When a player collects the correct number of dice with the proper value, he can brew one of the available recipes and gain points, gold, or another effect. Players can also enhance recipes by throwing in additional ingredients to earn a bonus (more gold, more points).&#10;&#10;",

There are even M60A3s sprinkled in to balance out the US tank inventory. Bradley IFVs and CFVs mechanized units are set to take on their counterparts mounted in BMP 1,2s and even a few 3s.  Not to overlooked M113A2s and BTRs and MT-LBs are also set to make their appearance.&#10;&#10;Mechanized infantry and their related weapons are in abundance, including M47 Dragon, M72 LAW, AT-7 Saxon, AT-4 Spigot, and multiple RPG versions.&#10;&#10;The scale is right down in the weeds with individual vehicles, infantry squads, half squads, and sections.  Each hex is just 100 meters across, so it is going to be nose-to-nose action at its finest.&#10;&#10;The rules cover the total realm of modern mechanized combat with ATGMs, including TOW and deadly Soviet gun launched missiles like the AT-11 Sniper and AT-8 Songster, special armor (including ERA), advanced night fighting with thermal images and image intensifiers, advance artillery with ICM and laser-guided shells, helicopters, including the AH-64A Apache and Mi-24P Hind-F, attack aircraft, including the A-10A Warthog and SU-25 Frogfoot, and missile and gun-armed AA units to counter the deadly air threats.  It is all included in this total package.&#10;&#10;",

The game pieces are the heart, Amor, the devil, 3 male guardian hearts, 7 female guardian hearts and 2 impetuous hearts. They are used to protect the player's heart and impede the opponent's Amor. To do this, the pieces can move in specific ways (like in Chess) and can block or eliminate one another. The devil is the only piece, that can eliminate Amor. When Amor gets in a straight line with another's heart, he can shoot it and wins the game. The game can be played by 2 or 4 players. In the game for 4 players, the players at the opposite sides of the game board play against one another.&#10;&#10;The Game was most likely published in the 1920s.&#10;&#10;",

If Interpol does not find the bomb before it detonates, then the terrorist makes progress toward his goal of instilling fear across Europe.&#10;&#10;The job of Interpol is to coordinate the efforts of Secret Agents, Bomb Squad, Special Forces, and an Informant Network to stop the terrorist from accomplishing his goal.

With hidden movement cards, traps, bombs and recruiting cells to use, he tries to outmaneuver his opponents and stay one step ahead of them. The operatives goal is to catch the terrorist and defeat him in combat. Along the way, they want to avoid traps, defuse bombs, and defeat any recruiting cells the terrorist puts in their way. But the operatives have to be careful. If they get too spread out, the terrorist might attack and defeat them while they are isolated.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Doom and Bloom SURVIVAL! is a board game for 2-4 players. It takes place in a post-pandemic world where there are few survivors. Your mission is to have your character accumulate supplies like food, fuel, weapons, and medical kits, as well as scout locations that may serve as a haven in which to start over. Originally tailored to survival enthusiasts that wanted a real survival scenario (no zombies).&#10;&#10;You start off in once-peaceful center city, now controlled by raiders out to get what you have. There are plenty of resources out there, but you have to get to them and survive various encounters and attacks to reach towns that have potential as safe havens. You&rsquo;ll have to plan your route to include spots that have the assets you&rsquo;ll need to stockpile. Some of these spots are controlled by raiders, and you&rsquo;ll have to survive attacks to gain the items you need.&#10;&#10;Once you&rsquo;ve scouted locations, you&rsquo;ll have to return to center city for your family and more supplies.  You then pick a location as your final destination. If you can get there with the required supplies and survivors before anyone else, you win the game.&#10;&#10;The game dynamic revolves around the management of assets while you are traveling to your destinations. You'll be tempted to use them to gain an edge in an encounter, but you have to stockpile them to be able to win the game. Different gameplay styles and a unique route traveled in each game, plus game-changing Bonus cards, add variety.&#10;&#10;",

The oracles foretold of strangers who would maneuver the Five Tribes to gain influence over the legendary city-state. Will you fulfill the prophecy? Invoke the old Djinns and move the Tribes into position at the right time, and the Sultanate may become yours!&#10;&#10;Designed by Bruno Cathala, Five Tribes builds on a long tradition of German-style games that feature wooden meeples. Here, in a unique twist on the now-standard &quot;worker placement&quot; genre, the game begins with the meeples already in place &ndash; and players must cleverly maneuver them over the villages, markets, oases, and sacred places tiles that make up Naqala. How, when, and where you dis-place these Five Tribes of Assassins, Elders, Builders, Merchants, and Viziers determine your victory or failure.&#10;&#10;As befitting a Days of Wonder game, the rules are straightforward and easy to learn. But devising a winning strategy will take a more calculated approach than our standard fare. You need to carefully consider what moves can score you well and put your opponents at a disadvantage. You need to weigh many different pathways to victory, including the summoning of powerful Djinns that may help your cause as you attempt to control this legendary Sultanate.&#10;&#10;",

To earn points and win the game, the players attempt to sacrifice Minions from their cult to the Shoggoth (bad news for Minions, but what do you expect when you join an evil cult?). However, the Shoggoth is indiscriminate in who it eats; if you can't feed the Shoggoth on your turn with a Minion, it eats you, and you're out of the game!&#10;&#10;During your turn, if the Shoggoth is in front of you, you have the ability to sacrifice on Minion from your hand. The other Cult Leaders at the table can attempt to disrupt your sacrifice by casting spells to move the Shoggoth away from you, stealing Minions from your hand, or any one of many dastardly methods (Rival Cult Leaders are insidious that way).&#10;&#10;If the active player is still able to keep the Shoggoth in front of them during their sacrifice phase, the Minion is gobbled up, the player earns a point token, the Shoggoth moves to the player to the left, and the active player draws back up to their hand limit.&#10;&#10;The winner is either the first player to reach the victory point goal (determined how many players are participating), or the last player standing.&#10;&#10;The theme of the game is based on the works of HP Lovecraft; those players who are familiar with either the stories of HPL and/or the Call of Cthulhu role-playing game will recognize many of the names and terms on the cards. However, this isn't yet another game with the name &quot;Cthulhu&quot; tacked on at the end (and in fact, Cthulhu himself never directly makes an appearance in the game). The theme has been interwoven into the game play itself.&#10;&#10;",

Players then take turns moving their Characters on the board.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to build a cube of Characters in the central 2-by-2 &quot;Sun Square&quot; or to capture one of the opponent's Characters.&#10;&#10;Opposing characters can be captured, or trapped, by covering enough of their square faces with faces of your own characters.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Plants is a board game that attempts to model the life of plants from their point of view in a specific, easily playable format. Plants is also a modular, organic game system that can grow and adapt beyond a single game board or a set of rules. The game is not meant to be an educational simulation, but more like an open creative project that deliberately intertwines certain biological concepts with suitable board game mechanisms.&#10;&#10;During the game, the players continuously move through several different types of phases and perform actions at their own pace. They must try to adapt to the whims of the competing players and manipulate the upcoming situations to help them pollinate their flowers and gather enough nutrients and energy to produce seeds. At same time the players may sprout from the seeds, use the nutrients to grow in the habitat area and be forced to use up their energy to get rid of pesky larvae. Having enough water available is always a concern, and sometimes the players must accept losing their precious biomass. And if the players are not careful, they might even be eliminated from the game completely.&#10;&#10;Plants features no randomness after a simple setup and there are no auctions, negotiations or trading. It has an open spatial element with shared resources and some three-dimensional play. The actions are short and the turns go by quickly and the possible butterfly effects keep situations tense. Clever planning and timing is required for success, and in the end only the number of seeds matter.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Set in the mid-1800s, the golden age of whaling, New Bedford gives you the chance to build the Massachusetts town of the same name into a thriving whaling community. Gather resources to add buildings with new actions and launch ships to go whaling. Go out longest for the best choice, but wait too long and the whales become harder to catch. And don't forget to pay your crew when ships return! Carefully balance time management and timing to earn the most points in this medium-weight worker placement and resource management game.&#10;&#10;In more detail, over twelve rounds players take turns placing two workers per round, one at a time. The town board and whaling board contain basic game actions: taking goods (food, wood, brick), selling goods, building buildings, docking ships, and launching ships. These actions can be used multiple times per round, with the first player to do so in a round receiving a bonus or more goods or reducing the number of goods paid.&#10;&#10;Most buildings add extra action spaces with new actions, combined actions, and more powerful versions of basic actions. You own whatever you build, with others needing to pay to use them and you earning points from them at game's end.&#10;&#10;You need to pay to send ships whaling, choosing how far out to send them. At the end of the round, ships move closer to shore and whale tokens are drawn randomly. Ships that are farthest out have first chance to pick the valuable sperm whales, but as they move in, others have the opportunity to launch farther out and get a better pick, possibly leaving you with only empty seas. Over the course of the game, whales become more rare and empty seas more common. Once a ship reaches shore, a percentage of the profits (the &quot;lay&quot;) must be paid in order to keep the whales selected.&#10;&#10;After twelve rounds, all ships must return, and players total their points from buildings, whales, and extra money. High score wins.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "A member of the Checkers Family very popular in Brasil.&#10;&#10;Brazilian Checkers or Draughts is played under the same basic rules that apply to International Checkers except that it is played on a smaller 8 x 8, or 64-square board with each player playing 12 pieces.&#10;&#10;This variant is started by the player who either wins a random toss of a coin or the player who plays the light colored pieces. Then the players alternately make their moves thereafter.&#10;&#10;Rules of the Game: This checkers variation is played using an 8 x 8, or 64 squares checker board of light and dark squares and each player has 12 pieces of contrasting colors, usually red and white. The board is placed between the two players in such a way that the double corner is on the right side and a dark colored square is on the left side of each player. The player places his pieces on the first three rows on his side of the board&#10;&#10;The Moves of the Men: Checker players can only move their pieces forward one at a time on each empty square to the left or to the right. If a player successfully moves his pieces to the last, or &quot;king row,&quot; then that piece must be crowned &quot;king&quot; by the opponent by placing a second checker on top of the crowned piece.&#10;&#10;The Moves of the King: King pieces are &quot;flying kings,&quot; which means that they can move over many empty squares on the diagonal lines that pass over the square on which they are located.&#10;&#10;Captures: In Brazilian Checkers captures are mandatory. And, maximum captures are compulsory as well, which means that if a player has more than one way to capture the opposing pieces then he must choose that way that will result in the capture of the most number of pieces. If a checker piece reaches the king row while in a capture sequence, it must keep on capturing pieces backward for as long as there still pieces to capture. That capturing piece cannot be crowned king unless it finishes the move and stops on king row.&#10;&#10;Captures by the Men: Men can capture by jumping forward or backward over a single piece that is located next to it only if the square located next to the captured piece is unoccupied. If the man can jump again from its landing square to make another capture, then it must do so because all captures are mandatory.&#10;&#10;Captures by a King: A crowned piece can capture an opponent's piece forward and backward diagonally if it is on the same path where it is located and if the squares between them are unoccupied and that if the square immediately after the piece that will be captured is also unoccupied. The crowned piece can land on any empty square within the same path and if a continuous capture is possible, then the player must keep on capturing even if this move will not redound to the best interest of the player making the capture.&#10;&#10;The Winning Player: A player wins the game if he has captured all of his opponent's pieces or successfully blocked his opponent's pieces such that the opponent is unable to move any of his pieces.&#10;&#10;Conditions for a Draw: The players can mutually agree to a draw. A draw may also happen if the same position has occurred three times during the game, or if there are three crowned pieces playing against one and that both players have made 16 moves without attaining any promotion or making a capture.&#10;&#10;Information from checkershistory.com&#10;&#10;",

Whether it is small skirmishes or flat out war, Hunted can be played with 2 players or as many players as you like.&#10;&#10;In Hunted, you control units from one of four Factions, which are portrayed with 28mm scale models:&#10;&#10;- United Terran Defence Force, humans who are fighting to survive on an unknown planet.&#10;&#10;- SESHIMAI (SEed SHIp Modulator AI, often shortened to MAI), AI control robotics whose corrupted data cores have listed all organic life as needing to be destroyed rather than protected.&#10;&#10;- Predators, defending their territory from new and strange beings.&#10;&#10;- Herbivores, fending off new predators and old in order to continue to live.&#10;&#10;Players build their own armies with models in each faction and build a deck to complement it, then take turns in order to wipe out their opponents models. &#10;Unlike traditional miniature games, there is limited use of dice within the game, with no dice rolls to hit or save your miniatures; instead you rely on your cards.&#10;&#10;",

In between rounds of card play (similar to Rook or Euchre), players take turns flicking cards at the winner's temple. Points are awarded on both card play and card flicking.&#10;&#10;Simple and fun, Shogun Showdown is a nice break from conventional games that have you sitting for long periods of time.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In Cultists of Cthulhu, you play as a student or professor at Miskatonic University, working with your friends to investigate the horrors invading your school. Unbeknownst to the rest of you, one of your friends is secretly a Cultist, eager to sacrifice the rest of you to their dark master.&#10;&#10;The Academics must work together to accomplish the goals of the scenario before the stars align and the Cultist is able to pull off their scheme, reveal themselves, and summon a Shoggoth, a flight of Night Gaunts, or reveal themselves to have been a Mi-Go the whole time, to pick three example Cultists from a single scenario, the Fungi from Yuggoth.&#10;&#10;The game is played in rounds, consisting of each player taking a turn, and then one University Phase. On a turn, a player draws an Event card related to their location, resolves it using a push-your-luck ability check mechanic which forces them to make trade offs between personal harm or harm to the group, and then takes two Actions: Move, Fight, Search, Steal, Trade, Use an Item, or a Scenario specific event. The University Phase consist of moving any monsters that may be on the board, followed by the starting player drawing two University cards, selecting one to play and one to shuffle back into the deck without revealing. These cards are all bad for the Academics, but in different ways and to different degrees, so this is another opportunity for the Cultist to secretly advance their own agenda. The starting player then passes the Starting Player token to their left and a new round begins.&#10;&#10;The Academic players are trying to complete their Scenario specific goals before the Cultist kills them. For instance, in the Fungi from Yuggoth scenario, the Academic goals are: A1: assemble a complete Elder Sign, A2: take it to Chapel, B1: find the Necronomicon in the Vault or Library, B2: use it as described on its card. Players gain Elder Sign pieces by successfully completing Events, by searching, or by making them in the Art Department with a Finesse check. Players look for the Necronomicon in the Library with Reason checks, or the Vault with Focus checks. Events also have a chance of advancing the Star Chartz The Academics win if they complete their goals before the last of them is killed, the Cultist wins if they kill all of the Academics. When the Star Chart reaches a certain number, the Cultist may reveal themselves to gain some horrid benefit. For instance, in the Fungi from Yuggoth, all players know that the Cultist is trying to get the Star Chart to either 15 so they can reveal themselves to be a Mi-Go in a human costume, or 20 so they can summon a trio of Night Gaunts, or 25 so they can summon a Shoggoth. All players know these are the options, but only the Cultist knows which one they are actually trying to do.&#10;&#10;Cultists of Cthulhu is a big-box, semicooperative, thematic game of mystery, investigation, teamwork, and betrayal. The board is modular, and assembled at the beginning of each game in a rapid-fire, real-time setup. With this very fast, unique map setup, 12 characters, 4 different scenarios, each with multiple possible hidden Cultist goals, Cultists of Cthulhu provides near infinite diversity and replayability.&#10;&#10;Featuring an ability check mechanism using custom dice which allows for meaningful decisions every turn, an innovative combat system, dark, suspenseful art, and gripping theme music, Cultists of Cthulhu has been called &quot;possibly the next Arkham Horror.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

They were designed by Jason Tagmire and illustrated by Campbell Whyte.&#10;&#10;Each card features an illustration with 4 unique elements. There is a character, holding an item, completing an action, in a location. Each of these elements can be used to create something new, get you out of a mid-project slump, or just to have some creative fun with family and friends.&#10;&#10;The cards also feature additional icons in the corners to help you dig a little deeper into storytelling, creating, and gaming. The icons represent a rank, suit, mood, season, letter, and color.&#10;&#10;The Storyteller Manual includes rules for 16 different ways to play. From strategic coloring to push-your-luck storytelling, there are game variations for everyone. Many variants are story based gaining points for each card played, best poker hands and matching card elements, but others include strategic coloring (where players must complete illustration quadrants to earn points), and endless possibilities (where the players create and change the rules in a race to 30 points).&#10;&#10;",

The base set will consist four pre-built decks, 30 cards each, so it is playable right out of the box and thus non-customizable. However new, additional sets will add deck customization as an option as well.&#10;&#10;In AWE, each player assumes the role of a mighty god ruling over one out of four fascinating factions, the goal of the game being to breach the opponent defenses and destroy all the opponent guardians in order to &quot;dethrone&quot; their god. An undefended attack will lead to the destruction of one guardian and if there are none left, a direct attack dethrones the opponent god, spelling defeat for that opponent.&#10;&#10;AWE is set in a historically not at all accurate prehistory, where four advanced, lost civilizations - Atlantis, Hyperborea, Lemuria and Mu - vie for ultimate domination. The game will feature awesome and fantastic untis you can send into battle such as Raptor and Pterodactyl Riders, Zombie T-Rex's reanimated by black magic, advanced Vimana aircraft, War Mammoths and much more, as well as a pleasant mix of unique and exciting mechanics.&#10;&#10;This game is a collaboration between talented Indonesian artist Widodo Pangarso and Austrian Game Designer Andreas Propst.&#10;&#10;",

Players connect  jigsaw puzzle-shaped pieces with scenes from the movie Cars on it in order to complete a logical sequence. Adults can help the children by telling the accompanying stories which come with the game. The game provides 6 different sequences of 9 scenes each, which are combined if played with 2-6 players. On their turn players choose a piece from the table and check whether it can be connected with the previous/starting piece of their sequence or not. If so, they can keep the piece, otherwise they has to put it back on the table. The first player to finish his sequence wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

For each damage a player takes, that player discards a random hex from their magical bag. If a player is required to draw a hex from the bag and cannot do so, they lose immediately.&#10;&#10;While emulating many key mechanics of the original Elemental Clash Customizable Card Game, such as deck depletion as the win condition and the beloved-by-many &quot;Boon&quot; mechanic, Elemental Clash HEX is a whole new experience and twist on the original game, as many mechanics are new, fresh and unique, taking advantage of what the medium hex-tiles can offer.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, the game features stunning artwork by a talented cast of international artists, elevating the game on state-of-the-art level when it comes to visuals as well.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Arsenal: Arena Combat is a 2-6 player customizable card game that uses a hex-map game board, tokens or miniature mechs, counters and 6-sided dice to facilitate play.&#10;&#10;In Arsenal, you take on the role of a pilot in a combat mech arena. This arena is represented by a small hex map (the gameboard). You move your Mech around on this map to gain an advantage against your opponent, and then play cards from your hand to attack or defend. You will manage your power levels (the resource used to play cards), and use all manner of tactics to win out against your opponent.&#10;&#10;To play Arsenal, each player first chooses a Mech, then they each build a deck from the cards available to that Mech (not all Mechs are created equal). Next you and your opponent(s) shuffle your decks, grab 8 energy cards, a handful of 6-sided dice and damage counters, and put a token on the board that matches your Mech. Then you figure out who's going first and start playing!&#10;&#10;- Players take turns moving their Mech around the arena, and playing cards from their hand to represent things like lock-ons, deployable objects, or any number of actions and reactions.&#10;- On your turn, you play attack cards from your hand that represent both your weapons and your ammunition, provided your target is within the attack's effective range.&#10;- When an attack is played, all players have a chance to react to it, by playing their own cards that represent things like taking evasive maneuvers or bracing for impact.&#10;- After everyone has had a chance to react, the attack is resolved: the attacker and defender both roll a number of dice determined by the attack card, range, and other variables. Both players then add up the number of 1's and 6's they rolled.&#10;- The defender must meet or beat the attacker's roll in order to dodge the attack. If they don't, it hits, and their Mech takes damage! Continue until only one Mech (or team) is left standing.&#10;&#10;All cards have an energy cost. You have 8 energy to spend on every player's turn, but you also have the option to &quot;burn&quot; any or all of your 8 energy. Doing so could pay off big, but &quot;burned&quot; energy comes back at a much slower rate, leaving you open to counter attack.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Beastie Bash! isn&rsquo;t just a card game for kids, it&rsquo;s outside-the-box thinking -- in a box.&#10;&#10;WHAT IS BEASTIE BASH&#10;Beastie Bash! is a silly character creation game for 1-4 players. It&rsquo;s 20 minutes of family fun created by children&rsquo;s book author/illustrator, Eric Wight.&#10;&#10;OBJECT OF THE GAME&#10;Combine the highest scoring HEAD card with a BODY card to win the cards for that round. The game winner is the player who collects the most Beasties.&#10;&#10;WHO IS BEASTIE BASH! FOR?&#10;Beastie Bash! is for kids with wild imaginations. For families who prefer silly to serious. For parents &amp; educators who think the world needs innovators, not fill-in-the-bubblers.&#10;&#10;THE BIRTH OF BEASTIE BASH! &#10;The concept for Beastie Bash! was inspired by Eric Wight&rsquo;s experiences as both a parent and a children&rsquo;s book author. His favorite hobby is playing games with his kids. So he thought it would be fun to create a game they could all play together. But that was just the beginning.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;This past year, my daughter was diagnosed with dyslexia. As I was designing Beastie Bash! I realized that this game could also be a fun tool to help her improve her reading and math skills. We can play it for hours and it doesn&rsquo;t feel like homework to her. Plus, by mixing up the cards, the text is continually changing.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;As an author, Eric has the opportunity to travel around the world teaching kids what it&rsquo;s like to create stories for a living. At these events, students brainstorm ideas for new adventures, which Eric illustrates on the spot.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;The kids always have so many cool ideas that it&rsquo;s tough to choose just one. So I thought it would be fun to mash a few together. I could never have predicted how much it made the students and teachers laugh. I realized I was onto something, and set out to create a game that captured that same creative, unpredictable humor.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;RULES OF PLAY&#10;&#10;SET UP&#10;2 - 4 players. Shuffle the deck. Evenly divide the cards face down to each player. No peeking!&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY&#10;Each player draws 5 cards from their pile. Pair a HEAD and BODY combination to make the highest score possible and place it in front of you. A color match earns an additional +5 points, a MEGA-MATCH earns +10 points and a &quot;TRUE MATCH&quot; (i.e.: the original head and body combination) earns double points.&#10;&#10;POWER PRIZES&#10;Once everyone has revealed their Beastie, players may improve their chance of winning by using a POWER PRIZE card if they possess one. Begin with the player who has the lowest scoring Beastie and continue clockwise. The player with the highest scoring Beastie wins all of the Beasties from this round. Discard the used POWER PRIZE cards.&#10;&#10;THE BOOM! CARD&#10;The BOOM! card is very powerful and may be played at any time. When a player uses a BOOM! card, it scares away all of the Beasties. Everyone's cards are discarded no matter what their point value is or what POWER PRIZE cards are being used. Bummer!&#10;&#10;TIE-BREAKER&#10;If at the end of the round the score is tied, players may draw enough cards to refill their hand and play another Beastie. Repeat until the tie is broken.&#10;&#10;NO PAIRS&#10;If you are unable to make a pair with your cards, you must:&#10;&#10;1. Discard 2 cards from your hand.&#10;&#10;2a. Use the top 2 cards from your collected Beastie pile.&#10;&#10;OR&#10;&#10;2b. Draw 2 cards from your unused deck. If you draw two cards from your unused deck, you must discard all 5 cards AND lose your turn. At the beginning of the next round you may draw 5 new cards.&#10;&#10;ENDING THE GAME&#10;The game ends when the first player runs out of cards. Count how many Beasties you collected. The player with the most wins!&#10;&#10;ALTERNATE GAME PLAY&#10;1-player: Similar to a traditional match game. Place all the cards face down. The object is to find the Power Prizes before you find the Boom! cards. Turn them over two at a time to find Power Prizes. Once you find a character match, it can be removed from the board. If you flip over 4 Boom! cards, you lose.&#10;&#10;LEVEL-UP WITH LEARNING&#10;Beastie Bash! isn&rsquo;t just fun to play, it&rsquo;s also a great tool for learning both at home and in the classroom.&#10;&#10;READING: Each card contains funny flavor text that brings the characters to life. With each new match, the text changes, creating countless new reading experiences.&#10;&#10;MATH: Kids practice addition skills as they play each round of the game. Older kids can multiply instead of add to make the math more challenging.&#10;&#10;WRITING: Create your own adventures using the mix-and-match cards as writing prompts.&#10;&#10;",

You will decide how much of your fleet you want to commit to take this new planet, but the other players may decide they think it is worth battling over.

Players then continue to commit ships and upgrades to better their rivals until one player emerges victorious.&#10;&#10;Sounds simple enough. And it is simple; but simple doesn't always mean easy.

All the players keep their words secret while they draw their own phrases. When everyone finishes, the group works together trying to guess the words that each artist had based on their drawings. Each correct word guessed earns the artist two points, while each close, but not exact word earns the artist 1 point. The player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;Since it&rsquo;s a game about creativity, adapting the game and playing by house rules are encouraged. For instance, younger players may want to only draw 4 cards (skipping the adverb) to adjust the game to fit their level.&#10;&#10;While groups of 2-8 players work best, the game can be played alone as a drawing exercise or even in a group of up to 54 players each with their own 5-card phrase!&#10;&#10;Game Includes: 54 red Adjective cards, 108 yellow Noun Cards, 54 green Verb cards, 54 blue Adverb cards, 8 small pencils, and a pad a paper.

        "description": "&Ocirc; &#196;&#130;n Quan (literally: &quot;Mandarin Square Capturing&quot;), also known as &Ocirc; L&agrave;ng (&quot;Village Squares&quot;), is a mancala game played by Vietnamese girls usually seven to ten years old. According to Ng&ocirc; Qu&yacute; S&#198;&#161;n, the oldest western source on the game, it was once played by boys too. The game is valuable for promoting calculating abilities. It is said that the Vietnamese mathematician M&#225;&#186;&#161;c Hi&#225;&#187;&#131;n T&iacute;ch discovered s&#225;&#187;&#145; &#225;&#186;&#169;n (negative numbers; literally: &quot;hidden / secret number&quot;) in 1086 by playing &Ocirc; &#196;&#130;n Quan.&#10;&#10;The game was first described in a western language (French) by Ng&ocirc; Qu&yacute; S&#198;&#161;n in 1944. It seems to be identical to &Ocirc; L&agrave;ng described by Lynn Rohrbough in 1955. A Vietnamese mancala game was also mentioned in Viltis (&quot;Hope&quot;) in 1984 (January-February issue), a magazine of folklore and folk dance published in Denver, USA.&#10;&#10;There is a Vietnamese mancala board in the Mus&eacute;e du Quai Branly (Paris, France) called pan u ao, which comes from the Muong people in Hoa Binh in northern Vietnam and was collected in 1938. Perhaps it was used for &Ocirc; &#196;&#130;n Quan. The game itself seems to be related to mancala games found in Yunnan, China, such as Laomuzhu and Ceelkoqyuqkoqiji.&#10;&#10;&Ocirc; &#196;&#130;n Quan is a traditional Vietnamese children's board game.&#10;&#10;The board is an oval with five squares per side and, in addition, a bigger one at each end. The small squares are called &quot;citizen squares&quot; (&ocirc; d&acirc;n), &quot;ricefields&quot; (ru&#225;&#187;&#153;ng) or &quot;fishponds&quot; (ao ci) and the big ones &quot;mandarin squares&quot; (&ocirc; quan). The board is drawn on the ground.&#10;&#10;Each player or team controls five farmer squares, while the mandarin squares are neutral. Each player puts five pebbles (fruit seeds or other small objects) in each square he owns and a big stone, the &quot;mandarin&quot; (quan), on the mandarin square. The pebbles are known as d&acirc;n (&quot;people&quot;, &quot;citizen&quot;).&#10;&#10;On his turn a player picks up the contents of one of his ricefields and distributes the pebbles, one by one, in either direction on the following squares (including both mandarin squares). This is called r&#225;&#186;&#163;i (&quot;to scatter&quot;).&#10;&#10;When all pieces are distributed, the player repeats by taking up the pieces of the following square and distributing them.&#10;&#10;When the next square to be distributed is empty, the player wins all the pieces in the square after that.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the two mandarin squares are empty, which is called &quot;fall of the mandarins&quot; (h&#225;&#186;&#191;t quan). The winner is the player who has more points. Pebbles count 1 point, mandarins 10 points.&#10;&#10;",

A tremendously fun sorting game for 1-4 animal lovers.&#10;&#10;One of the boards is placed over the bottom of the game box (one corner is cut so that it is lined up correctly). The boards have different shaped cutouts that correspond to the shapes of the animal pieces and the shapes on the die (star is wild). Players have to match the corresponding pieces to the different cutouts, which go into different (walled) areas of the game box.&#10;&#10;There are several options for play:&#10;&#10;(For two players) With the green board in place, give each player a set of the animal pieces, so each player has one of each animal. On their turn, a player rolls the die, and fits the piece shown on the die into the matching hole. When a star is rolled, any piece may be selected. The object is to put all of the pieces into the holes. When the board is lifted, players can see that all pieces are in the correct stable.&#10;&#10;(For two players) Place the blue board on the box. Rules are the same as the green board rules, above, except when the board is lifted, the animals are not yet in the right stalls. The second phase begins. The players win if they can sort the animals into the correct stalls.&#10;&#10;The components can also be used in more open-ended play:&#10;&#10;(For several players and one adult) Only the game box is used, no board is placed on it. The adult tells a story, and the players must do what the story tells them (&quot;The chicken goes to the chicken coop&quot;). The instructions provide ten examples, and more can be created by the adult. For more advanced play, the story can give a sequence of moves (&quot;The cow jumps from the stable to the gardens&quot;).&#10;&#10;(An adult and a child) The boards and wooden pieces are not used, only the box. Questions are asked about the scenes on the game box.&#10;&#10;- Who lives in the garden? &#10;- Where are the two chicks? &#10;- What color are the animals? &#10;- How many beets are in the pigsty? (2) &#10;- How many apples are in the basket? (4)&#10;&#10;",

One player commands the Axis powers, the other the Allies.&#10;&#10;Players maneuver their armies on an area map of Europe, fighting for control of key victory cities and critical resources.  Air, naval, and ground units are all involved.  Battles are fought when enemy units clash in the same area.&#10;&#10;The early war 1939-1941 is driven by the Axis, but gradually the Allies become stronger and usually take the initiative by 1943.  However, the game need not unfold exactly like history.&#10;&#10;The French may survive 1940, the Germans may invade Britain.  Germany may attack Russia in June 1941, or attack earlier, or later, or not at all.  The Soviets may attack Germany first which was likely their plan.&#10;&#10;The USA might enter the war in 1942, perhaps earlier, perhaps later.  All of these decisions are made by the players, influenced by Diplomatic events that are controlled by game events.  Invading neutral countries such as Norway or Belgium has consequences.&#10;&#10;",

Pieces are captured by hopping over them, and the board is composed of two triangle grids.&#10;&#10;It is the same game as Butterfly (game) from Mozambique, which suggests a historical connection between the two games.&#10;&#10;Lau kata kati belongs to a specific category of games called Indian War-games, and the other games in this category are Dash-guti, Egara-guti, Pretwa, Gol-skuish. All Indian War-games have one important thing in common, and that is that all the pieces are laid out on the grid patterned board, with only one vacant point in the center. This forces the first move to be played on the central point, and captured by the other player's piece.&#10;&#10;To capture all of the opponent's pieces, or be the one with more pieces when no more pieces can be taken by either player, or stalemate the other opponent's pieces such that they are immobilized.&#10;&#10;It is important to realize that Lau kata kati's board is the basis of other games, in particular, Dash-guti and Egara-guti. In serves as a basis for other games in the same way that the Alquerque board and the draughts board is a basis for other games.&#10;&#10;",

But best of all, Linkage was designed and themed around a process normally taught in high school biology, DNA Transcription, (when an RNA copy is made from DNA for protein synthesis or other in a cell) and in this way offers a unique, engaging and tactile experience for someone to familiarize themselves with this fundamental concept of biology.&#10;  &#10;In Linkage, DNA cards are randomly aligned side-by-side creating a DNA template strand. Players compete to build the most accurate RNA copy of this DNA Template by connecting their own RNA Cards side-by-side to match the DNA Template.&#10;&#10;During a turn, players choose between one of four actions: Building onto their RNA Strand, Fixing their RNA strand, Mutating an opposing players RNA Strand, or Mutating the actual DNA Strand. Players can also pay (discard) cards from their hand to take extra actions during their turn.&#10;&#10;Players are awarded points based upon the number of RNA Cards in their strand that correctly pair with the DNA template. The game can be played in as little 10 to 20 minutes but additional rounds can be added for a longer, more in-depth game. Multiple decks can also be added together for a game with more than 4 people, or a longer overall game.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Krash Karts is a table top game in which players race to a finish line that's ever changing. This is because you design the very track you're racing on, while you're racing on it. How it comes together is up to those playing, and manipulating the track to your advantage or against your opponent's advantage plays a large factor in determining the victor. You can even design your own short-cut.&#10;&#10;Coupled with this unique game mechanic, players during the race also gain items, such as the Booster, which lets you jet ahead of the competition; The Dodge Ball, which whacks your friends and slows them down; The Squirrel, which creates a roadblock forcing players to change course; Or the Bomb which decimates the track and all on it. Some items are left right on the track to benefit or to hinder your friends, and other items can even be used to defend yourself, making each game unique and strategic.&#10;&#10;Changes from Mad Rush Rally (Source: Sean McDonald on Krashin' Karts)&#10;&#10;Krash Karts resolves some strategic issues players had with the game where lagging behind intentionally during the race was one of the better strategies. This has been fixed by giving the last player better chances to get better items, but have less control over how the track lays out. Further, the Track has been reduced to 3 lanes, rather then the 4 of Mad Rush Rally, but players are allowed to occupy the same space now. The track has also now been laid out in a staggered pattern ala Formula D, rather than a grid, and also now accompanies a max of 6 players, rather then 4. Further, the rally car pieces have been changed to go-karts, and items can now be used not only offensively, but defensively.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "From the box:&#10;&#10;Huzzah! simulates American Civil War combat at the battalion level. The system features encounters little known yet strategically fraught. These are fights that, had they concluded differently, might well have transformed a campaign, a reputation, or both. So, while the battles in Huzzah! were little more than a scrimmage when compared to, say, Gettysburg or Stones River, they were not insignificant, bearing weight well beyond what mere numbers suggest.&#10;&#10;This game is the first installment of what will become a series of games using the Huzzah! system. The next installment in the series will be Wilderness, in quadri-game form but which will come together in one big campaign game.&#10;&#10;Scale: Combat units are Infantry, Cavalry, and Artillery. Each Infantry and Cavalry unit represents 3 or more companies of a given regiment. Each Artillery unit represents an Artillery Section of 1 or two guns. Leader units represent individual commanders. Each hex equals about 150-200 yards.&#10;&#10;Stephenson's Depot was a prelude to the battle of Gettysburg. Richard Ewell enjoyed his finest day of the campaign when he smashed the isolated outpost of Robert Milroy at Winchester. This is a rock-em sock-em affair, with the Yankees throwing the first punch. The blue player must land his blows quick and hard, driving the Rebs off the railway.&#10;&#10;Rosey and the Woodpecker, the battle of Iuka, was a meeting engagement of sorts; few units begin on map and both sides receive a steady stream of reinforcements. Grant, the Yankee commander had divided his army into wings, each to simultaneously converge upon the rebels at the small railhead of Iuka.&#10;&#10;Old Burn at Newbern, the battle of Newbern, North Carolina. A promising young star of the Union, Ambrose Burnside (Old Burn to his equals) runs up against a scratch force of Confederate militia, artillery, and cavalry.&#10;&#10;Smash 'Em Up! the battle of Belmont Missouri, was U.S. Grant's first significant encounter with the Confederate Army. He initially drove the Rebels across the Mississippi River capturing both their headquarters and Belmont, a minor ferry point to Kentucky.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;4 17x22 Full Color Maps&#10;560 Half-Inch Counters&#10;1 Rules Book&#10;2 Sheets of Charts &amp; Tables&#10;Dice&#10;Game Box&#10;&#10;",

Use cards to build your stories and triumph in this quickfire game.&#10;&#10;Next England Captain is a two to four player card game that faithfully models the career of a modern footballer; a challenge for everyone who's ever failed to earn millions by kicking things really well.&#10;&#10;Welcome to a world where your celebrity wife matters more than the club you play for, but only if you have the right promo deals. It's a world where your status in the squad matters - but not very much - and where retirement is just another opportunity. Here, becoming England Captain has less to do with your footballing ability and more to do with whether you&rsquo;re married with kids.&#10;&#10;Starting with nothing, you gain points as you move to bigger clubs, increasing your on-field stature, sponsorship, and your off-field respect. Careers may go down as well as up - so you won't have it all your own way - but capping it all off with a wise retirement can make all the difference. The winner is the player with the most points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;",

Players compete to put the most Sandwiches in play, and the first player to have 7 Sandwiches in play or if there are no cards left to draw, then the player with the most Sandwiches wins.&#10;&#10;How do you get Sandwiches?  You set your opponent up.  Every card has two abilities on it, when you play the card, you do both abilities in order.  Every card also has a Sandwich on it, when your opponent does the action listed for the Sandwich, then you get to score that card as a Sandwich.  The abilities on the card are about either drawing cards, or stealing cards, or replacing cards, or controlling what your opponent draws or has in their hand.  In short, you are manipulating your opponent's situation so that they play what you want them to play, so you can score points or 'Sandwich' off of their play.&#10;&#10;",

Can you successfully build a nest to impress your mate, or convince those strange 2-legged creatures that you'd make a good candidate for domestication?&#10;&#10;Based on the cards you play, creatures are rated on 4 attributes (aggression, resilience, allure, &amp; gathering), and can also have over a dozen different special abilities (flying, swimming, climbing, desert survival, etc.).&#10;&#10;Evolutionary pressure will determine how fast you can change -- a creature less well suited to its environment has all the more reason to change! And who knows how long favorable conditions will prevail? You need to strike a fine balance between dominating your competition now, and preparing for the future.&#10;&#10;Evolve is a fast-paced card game taking 1 hour or less to play. It is fun and suitable for adults who like &quot;euro-style&quot; games or card games. Who doesn't want to build animals?

        "description": "(From GMT Web site)&#10;&#10;Illusions of Glory: The Great War on the Eastern Front is the latest Card Driven Game to simulate the Great War in Europe.  First came Paths of Glory by Ted Raicer, which simulates the entire war in Europe and the Middle East.  It was followed by Pursuit of Glory, designed by Brad and Brian Stock, which focuses on the war in the Near East.  Illusions of Glory takes this game system to a new and exciting level by applying its focus to the Eastern Front.&#10;&#10;The Allied Powers bring massive forces to bear against Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey while trying to prevent a game-changing revolution in Russia.  The Central Powers must defeat Russia, hold off Italy, and win the upper hand in the Balkans or face demoralization and rebellion at home.  Players test their generalship and strategic abilities as Illusions of Glory lets you recreate the dramatic events of World War I&rsquo;s Eastern Front.&#10;&#10;Your hand of strategy cards present you with a rich array of strategic and operational choices.  You must decide whether to use each card for its historic event, unit movement, combat, or troop replacements. You must commit your forces to a variety of objectives: winning the dynamic war of maneuver between German-led and Russian armies; seizing the Balkans and its vital objectives; or prevailing in the conflict between Austria-Hungary and Italy.&#10;&#10;Illusions of Glory offers complete campaigns and shorter playing scenarios.&#10;&#10;GAME SCENARIOS:&#10;    Campaign Game&#10;    Mobilization&#10;    Limited War&#10;    Total War&#10;    Italian Front Mini Game&#10;&#10;GAME SCALE:&#10;    Historical Duration:  1914 to 1918&#10;    Units:  Corps and Divisions&#10;    Time:  Three months per turn&#10;    Map:  Point to Point&#10;    Players: 2-4&#10;&#10;",

Each player plays new cards striving for a low scoring grid (sets do not count against you)  The game is played over 9 rounds, like a 9 hole golf game.&#10;&#10;Paddy O'Shea's version of the game introduces special cards to a pair of traditional 52 card decks.  The special cards include 19th Hole Wild Cards (worth -5 points) and &quot;Good for Nothing&quot; (0 point) mulligan cards. There are also regular jokers and rules that differ slightly from the classic game.&#10;&#10;",

The Confederate Army is continuing its attack on the Union army, who are retreating towards the safety of Harrisons Landing. This is the largest set battle to date comprising of three battlefields, White Oak Swamp, Glendale and Malvern Hill. The battle is fought over two consecutive days.&#10;&#10;Historically it was the best chance that General Robert E Lee would have to break the Union army. The forces are evenly balanced but the Confederates are facing the largest concentration of artillery that the Civil War would see.&#10;&#10;Retreat to Harrisons Landing initially has a time limit of 36 bounds in which the Confederates must attack and gain objective ground, the game also comes with additional play options. The games design allows for a fast, fun and realistic game within a 6-8 hour period of continuous play. The game gives a flavour of the American Civil War period and a simple chain of command solution adds intrigue to the game.&#10;&#10;Combat is designed around the three factors that appear on the unit counters, these indicate the Range, Attack and Strength of the represented unit. You don&rsquo;t even need any dice to play the game since a dice tile system is included with the game, but if you want to roll dice then it&rsquo;s the simple six sided variety that you will require.&#10;&#10;The game board is designed to be used either 2 dimensionally as a straight print and play or 3 dimensionally.

The Confederates are in a position to attack a Union rear guard at Savage's Station.&#10;&#10;Combat is designed around the three factors that appear on the unit counters, these indicate the Range, Attack and Strength of the represented unit. You don&rsquo;t even need any dice to play the game since a dice tile system is included with the game, but if you want to roll dice then it&rsquo;s the simple six sided variety that you will require.&#10;&#10;The game board is designed to be used either 2 dimensionally as a straight print and play or 3 dimensionally, this takes a little more time to construct but it is well worth the effort for the impressive game board you get at its completion. The final 3D game board gives you a realistic feel to the terrain and shows the tactical dispositions of all the game counters.&quot; - Wargame Shop&#10;&#10;",

Rally with your fellow survivors and hold out until the rescue vehicle makes its appearance. Be aware, however, that it might not have room for everyone, so at some point you may have to decide whether to support your mates or to fight for yourself &mdash; but if all buddies die before help arrives, the zombies win.&#10;&#10;",

Each earned card gives player points, and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Wash Dash is unique in that it's a social project, a collaboration created by schoolchildren aged 12-14 and published by Brain Games thanks to a social initiative called &quot;(The Young Can Do It)&quot;, which aims to empower pupils by boosting their initiative and enabling them to be more secure when facing the future. To achieve this, a series of workshops is being held during which pupils develop ideas for products, which are then brought to market. This board game was created by 7th and 8th grade pupils. They also share the revenue from each product sold.&#10;&#10;",

In each round, two players are the detectives; the other players look at one of the 42 puzzle cards and choose one item from the list of possibilities. These players then receive a &quot;clue&quot; card at random, with these cards saying things like &quot;word&quot;, &quot;person&quot; or &quot;animal&quot;. The player to the left of the detectives must give a clue matching the type of clue listed on her clue card. Each detective can make one guess at the hidden word or phrase, then the next player gives a clue, etc.&#10;&#10;If no detective has guessed the right answer after twelve clues have been given, the round ends, no one scores, and the detective role shifts around the table. Otherwise, the detective who guessed correctly scores one point and the player who gave the clue scores two points. After everyone has been detective two or four times (depending on the number of players), whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

Each player then draws three images as quickly as possible, with the round ending as soon as the next-to-last player has finished his drawings.&#10;&#10;Everyone then compares their images to see who's drawn what. Real artists score one point for each image they drew that no one else drew, while fakes score one point for each image drawn by at least one real artist (and zero points for everything else).

The referee keeps the card deck in hand to help facilitate gameplay; each card shows one body part on the front and another body part (or possibly the same one) on the back.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the referee shows the active team the part depicted on the top card of the deck. This team can take this card or pass on it, but then they must take the next card. The teammates must now attempt to hold this card between the two players using the two body parts depicted. If they drop this card, their turn ends; if they drop other cards already held, however, they can continue to work with the current card, despite the tears that will inevitably ensue. Then the next team takes its turn.&#10;&#10;The game continues until at least one team holds six cards. If all teams have had the same number of turns and only one team holds six cards, this team wins; if several teams hold six cards, play another round, continuing the game until one team holds more cards than any other at the end of a round. This team wins!&#10;&#10;As a variant, Body Party includes a half-dozen cards that feature a body part on one side and a household object on the other (table, wall, chair, floor). These cards must be placed between a player on the team and the depicted item.&#10;&#10;",

The German begin the game on the Aksay River, and must cross the entire map to reach the roads beyond the Myshkova River leading to the Stalingrad pocket. This is the fourth entry of Joseph Miranda's East Front Battles system, which emphasizes the importance of command control. Combat units are battalions of not just infantry and armor, but a variety of supporting weapons. Each unit type has strengths and weaknesses, and all must be coordinated by a headquarters to fight at full power. This game pits German mobility and flexibility against Soviet numbers and combat power.&#10;&#10;Originally published in World at War magazine #36 (Jun-Jul 2014).&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 2 days&#10;Hex: 1.25 miles / 2.0 kilometers&#10;Units: Battalion to Corps&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheet&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (280 9/16&quot; counters)&#10;One 16-page rulebook&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 4-15&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Jazz (sometimes spelled Jass) is a game played with a traditional deck of cards, not to be confused with the Swiss game by the same name played with a special 36-card jass deck. The ideal number of players is four, but it can be adapted for three or five by removing one or two of the number 2 cards for a total of 51=3*17 or 50=5*10 cards.&#10;&#10;The game is a fixed collection of several short games and the winner is the player with the lowest total score. There are slight variants of the exact composition of included games and the scoring, however all but one are always trick-taking games while the last one is a variant of the game Fan Tan. All games start by dealing the entire deck so that each player receives the same number of cards. Common for all the trick-taking games is the requirement to follow suit if possible. The player of the highest card (ace being the highest) in that suit takes the trick and starts the next one. If a player lacks cards in the suit on the table he plays any one card of his own choice.&#10;&#10;Most Jazz variants consist of a selection of four to six of the following trick-taking games plus the final game of Fan Tan. The provided suggested penalty points provide for a balanced four-person game.&#10;&#10;1. &quot;Spades&quot; or &quot;Clubs&quot; &#10;A trick-taking game where the aim is to avoid taking cards of the specified suit. (2p each)&#10;&#10;2a. &quot;Tricks&quot;, &quot;Zero&quot;, or &quot;Minus&quot; &#10;Take as few tricks as possible. (2p each)&#10;2b. &quot;Plus&quot; &#10;Take as many tricks as possible. (-2p each) This seems to be a rare variant to include.&#10;&#10;3. &quot;Honors&quot; &#10;Avoid taking honor cards, i.e. 10, J, Q, and K. (2p each)&#10;&#10;4a. &quot;Jacks&quot;&#10;4b. &quot;Queens&quot; &#10;Depending on the variant, one should avoid taking either jacks or queens. (5p each) Some variants play both the Jacks and the Queens games one after the other, others play only one of them.&#10;&#10;5. &quot;King of Hearts and the Final Trick&quot;&#10;Avoid taking the very last trick as well as the king of hearts card. Some variants also give penalty points for the fifth trick. (10p each, sometimes with an extra penalty for taking the king of hearts as part of the final trick.)&#10;&#10;6. &quot;Solitaire&quot;, &quot;Seven&quot;, &quot;Fan Tan&quot;&#10;The final game is Fan Tan or a version thereof. One common rule specifies that the player having the 7 of diamonds always goes first by playing this card while another variant is started by normal clock-wise order and with any number seven card. The starting player is often allowed/required to play an additional card if possible. In each suit the 7 is played first followed by the 8 on one side and as the third card the 6 on the other side of the 7. As soon as these three cards have been played the ascending (9-K) and descending (5-A) runs of the suit are played independently of one another on top of the 8 and 6 cards. A player has to play one and only one card on his turn if possible. The game ends when a player runs out of cards. The other players score 3p for each remaining card of their own.&#10;&#10;",

If the player lands on an as-yet-unowned property, he has the opportunity to buy it and add it to his portfolio or allow the bank to auction it to the highest bidder. If a player owns all the spaces within a color group, he may then build houses and hotels on these spaces, generating even more income from opponents who land there. If he lands on a property owned by another player, he must pay that player rent according to the value of the land and any buildings on it. There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes, collect income, or even go to jail.&#10;&#10;Goal&#10;The goal of the game is to be the last player remaining with any money.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "This is a project of an 8th grade school class in Altensteig/ black forest/ Germany. The game is about an old tradition in this city: On christmas eve big fires are lit on two hilltops in the city. Torchbearers light their torch on one of the fires and spread out in the darkness to make a torch chain across the city.&#10;&#10;The game contains a gameboard, playing cards (people: the torch expert and torch novices, several kinds of wood needed for the torch fire = a tree and a wood base, then the wood that is to be stacked), action cards for the players to select their appropriate actions, 5 playing pieces, a torch point marker, one d6 die for dice duels and one die for the actions (one action, two actions, rainy day, unhappy face = sick torchbearers). Then there is the fire itself considering of a stack, a base and 14 wood pieces (actually from plastic).&#10;&#10;Gameplay: Each player gets a pawn, action cards, and 3 people cards and 3 wood cards. The game has two phases: first the fire is prepared: Torch bearers have to be found, the wood has to be gathered. Then the wood is stacked. When 14 stacks have been reached (the point marker or one of the player pawns reaches past 14 wood on the game board) the fire is ready to be lit. There is a final dice throw, and then the winner is the one having advanced the furthest up the game board, meaning the one who stacked the most wood.&#10;&#10;For the first phase a fire master is chosen - the first one rolling a 6 with the d6-die. Then each player chooses an action - gathering wood or getting torch bearers. The action die thrown by the fire master determines if an action is successful (no rainy day, no sick persons are rolled) and if successful if a single or double action is possible. If more than two players want the same action they roll the d6 to determine who can have a go.&#10;&#10;The fire master title changes clockwise to the next player each time a turn is finished.&#10;&#10;In the second phase the players - who have to have at least 3 torch bearer cards, one of them being an expert, first plant the tree, then the wood base, then wood stacks. For this they need to have the appropriate type and amount of wood cards. More than two people wanting to do the same roll it out with a d6. The action die determines if an action is successful (no rain), if torch bearer cards must be given up (sick persons) or an action can even be done twice. For a successful action the player pawn is moved one space up on the game board, for a double action two spaces. The point marker moves up one space up too (but only one even when two actions are made). Once the full stack of 14 is reached, either by a player pawn or indicated by the point marker, the game enters its last phase. To maximize their score each player can roll the d6. The player furthest behind has as many die rolls as are players present (e.g. player in 4th place can roll 4 times). If he/she rolls a 6 he/she can move up 4 spaces, player in 3rd place can roll 3 times and move up 3 spaces when rolling a 6 in these 3 rolls). Then the game ends and the player who is up the furthest is the winner.&#10;&#10;Apart from the cards the game contains a 3D-woodstack to visualize the fires progress.&#10;&#10;",

The game is played on the light colored squares, of which there are forty-one, including all four corners.  The squares on two opposite corners of the board are marked with a diamond shape and are called the Diamond King squares.  Each player has one of these corners of the board closest to him or her.  The next two light squares following the edges of the board to left and right are marked with rings and are called the King Squares.  Each player begins with twelve stackable checker pieces, each with its crown side facing down, on the nine closest light squares and on the middle three squares of the next row closest to the center of the board.&#10;&#10;Players take turns moving their pieces with the goal of eliminating their opponent from the board.  The ordinary pieces may move to one adjacent square vertically towards the opponent, or horizontally to the left or right.  Upon arriving on any of the opponent's King squares, a piece is turned over to become a King, and may now also move back towards his own side of the board.  Upon arriving on the opponent's Diamond King square, a piece has another stacked upon it with its crown side up and becomes a Diamond King.  Such a piece may move in any direction to an adjacent square, including diagonally.&#10;&#10;Pieces are removed from the board as in Checkers, by jumping over them to an empty adjacent square.  Pieces may capture in any direction in which they normally move.  Jumps may be continued as long as there is opportunity to capture more pieces in a single move.  Capture is compulsory, but a player is not required to inform his opponent of a missed opportunity.  Players with choices of more than one capture may choose which to take.&#10;&#10;The first player to remove all of his opponent's pieces wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Complexity and variety of this game with all its unexpected turns will inspire you!&#10;&#10;The process:&#10;Both players use their tactical skills to move their tiles and arrange the barragoon pieces to enable them to capture all their opponent`s tiles or to impede their opponent`s progress. &#10;A player has lost when he no longer has any tiles that he can move.&#10;&#10;The barragoon piece:&#10;The barragoon piece is the central element of the game. Each of its side shows another symbol. It blocks or frees the tiles to be moved in specific directions, depending on the direction indicated by the uppermost symbol. If a barragoon piece is captured, it can be placed again on the board at a free chosen position. By this, the players can block or attack the opponent or save their own tiles.&#10;&#10;The clou: &#10;Each time a tile is captured, two new, additional barragoon pieces have to be put on the board. By this, the board becomes more and more crowded and the risk to get locked up increases. At the same time the chance to beat the opponent increases as well.&#10;&#10;",

The players take on the roles of commanders and have to fight not only each others on the battle field but also the devastation that follows the war. Bellum se ipsum alet is a tactical game but unlike many others in the genre, the resources are not unlimited. The players must continuously feed their armies by storming and occupying cities but the cities will continuously fight to free themselves and for each new occupant, there will be less to plunder. Add to this a battle system where the players need to balance between wasting soldiers to win the battle and saving them for the next battle. Each player must thus find a way to make best use of the scarce and diminishing resources at hand to be able to deliver the final blow at the right place at the right time.&#10;&#10;Game mechanisms include:&#10;&#10;1. Tile laying: You gain influence by simply passing through areas and leaving your influence tiles behind you. However, you must defend your influence not only against your opponents but also against the cities, that eventually will revolt and reclaim the influence. &#10;2. Resource economy: Your army is no better than your economy, its strength is linked to supply from cities and if you lose the cities, you will eventually (but not immediately) lose your army and the war. &#10;3. Hidden bidding: The battle system is a kind of \\&quot;hidden bidding\\&quot;, which does not reward the player with the strongest army but rather the player who throws in just about more soldiers into the battle. The more you spend, the more you lose, and like Pyrrhus, you may find that your victories are so expensive that they will cause you to lose. &#10;4. Changing game board: The more the cities are conquered, the more they are devastated and the less they will contribute to your army. Your army must claim the victory before there is nothing left to feed it with.&#10;&#10;Bellum se ipsum alet is the second game in the Nova Suecia series.&#10;&#10;",

Players first drop their three pieces onto the board, and then move them to create a 3 in-a-row which wins the game. It is similar to games like Tapatan, Achi, Nine Holes, Shisima, and Tant Fant. However, what makes this game unique is that pieces can jump over each other (without capture) which adds an extra dimension in the maneuverability of the pieces.&#10;&#10;",

There is no cure.&#10;&#10;In Pandemic: Contagion, you are competing against other diseases (fellow players) to see who can eliminate humanity. With no cure to be had, the one of you that wipes out all human civilization will come out on top as the most deadly disease ever known to man, may he rest in peace.&#10;&#10;Pandemic: Contagion includes a deck of contagion cards with differing colored borders, city cards with similar colored borders, event/WHO cards, player disease card and disease cubes. On a turn you take two of three possible actions, and you can take the same action twice. Those actions are:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Draw contagion cards equal to your current incubation rate.&#10;     Advance one of three mutations to the next level.&#10;     Spread disease equal to your current transmission rate.&#10;&#10;&#10;When the number of diseases equals the city&rsquo;s population number, the city is wiped out.  The player who placed the final disease earns a special action. The player with the most diseases scores the population number. The two smaller numbers are awarded to those with the second- and third-most diseases.&#10;&#10;Your disease card has three mutations: Incubation (number of cards you can draw), Transmission (number of disease cubes you can spread), and Resistance (number of cubes/cards you can protect). As an action, you can advance a mutation one level by discarding the required number of cards.&#10;&#10;Event cards are drawn at the start of each round and affect everyone during their turn. You might benefit from the card or it could have a negative impact. WHO cards are always bad, but your resistance will lessen whatever the penalty would be based on its level, if you planned ahead.&#10;&#10;Mid-game scoring occurs when the second, fourth and sixth skull comes out.  When a city icon appears, a new city is introduced.&#10;&#10;Once the event/WHO deck runs out or only two city cards remain in play, the game ends, with players conducting a final scoring round to see which virus is victorious.&#10;&#10;Part of the Pandemic series.&#10;&#10;",

The  challenged one then responds in the same way of placing one of its card face down.&#10;&#10;Then all the other players must bet on the outcome of the duel with one of their remaining cards. &#10;Much is at stake because if you bet on the winner, you win his card. By cons, if you bet on the wrong squirrel he is one who wins the bet card. Additionally, the winner of the duel wins both cards that were used in the challenge.&#10;&#10;",

Great nations protect and provide for their own, while fighting and competing against both other nations and nature itself. Nations must provide food as the population increases, build a productive economy, and amaze the world with their great achievements to build up their heritage as the greatest nations in the history of mankind!&#10;&#10;Nations: The Dice Game is a game for 1-4 players that takes 10-15 minutes per player and shares many concepts with the civilization-building game Nations while still offering its own challenges. The game is played over four ages (four rounds). During each round, players take turns until all have passed. The available actions are:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Buy a tile&#10;     Build a wonder&#10;     Reroll some or all your dice&#10;&#10;&#10;Buildings and military provide dice. Colonies and wonders provide resources and victory points. Advisors provide rerolls. New tiles provide benefits immediately, so you can roll new dice at once.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, War and Famine drawn at the start of the round is checked for each player, giving you victory points if you match or beat the values. Books are accumulated and scored. Player order is checked, with high military strength going first in the next round. At the end of the game, whoever has the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;",

These blows, along with the witch-players&rsquo; ability to control or anticipate them, will determine whether the peasants stay on the island long enough or they are thrown into the deadly flames.&#10;&#10;Only the witch that manages to keep her unlucky peasants alive will win, preventing them from falling in the eternal flames that surround the cursed island of Infernis.&#10;&#10;",

An end goal of $25 is the normal amount for a 4 player, 30 minute game.&#10;&#10;You save money as a thrifty shopper by rolling the six (6) dice provided. Each side of each die has either a monetary amount ($1, $2, $3, $5 &amp; $10) or a special character ($, a circular arrow, X or Gift Card) on it. Earning money is as simple as rolling the dice and matching like amounts. After any roll, you must add at least one die to the scoring pool (these are the dice you are attempting to match like amounts with). You may stop rolling to score the amount of money shown on the dice once you have at least four (4) like amounts in your scoring pool. You may continue to roll the remaining dice, if you choose. You may also attempt to roll for the straight. A straight is one of each of the five different dollar amounts on the dice. If a player manages to roll a straight without using any &ldquo;Wild&rdquo; faces, that player may then choose to score $7.00. Should you not be able to add a die to your scoring pool, or once you have scored, your turn ends and the turn passes to the next player.&#10;&#10;",

In turns, players attempt to play a card by matching its color, number, or word to the topmost card on the discard pile.

Wild and special cards spice things up a bit.&#10;&#10;UNO is a commercial version of Crazy Eights, a public domain card game played with a standard deck of playing cards.&#10;&#10;",

You will master the rules very quickly and the game will never feel the same, because it gives you endless possibilities to experience something new. You will see your friends in comic situations and laught at things you are able to do trying to escape punishment. While playing Drinking Viking you will learn that the art is not to win but to manage not to lose!&#10;&#10;What&rsquo;s in the box?&#10;&#10;Drinking Viking party game contains 19 types of cards with unique illustrations shuffled in set of 42 cards, rulebook, 3 wooden dice and original cotton pouch.  To play, all you need are your friends, a viking heart and gaming spirit. It is that simple. The game can be played virtually anywhere. No board, no figures, no long setup. YOU are the figures and YOU are the board!&#10;&#10;Game mechanics&#10;&#10;Every card represents one mini game with unique rules. Players draw cards one by one to know what kind of game they are going to play and what challenge lies ahead. Some minigames are based on words, memory or creativity, others on luck, courage and quick reactions&#10;You will play minigames like  Egg,-chicken-dragon-Viking, Loki, 2-5-7, Mad king, Thor&rsquo;s hammer, Odin, Hunt , Drinking Viking and many more.&#10;&#10;Game goal&#10;&#10;Goal of this game is the game itself. Players try not to loose in various minigames to escape punishment. Each mini game is competitive and has unique winning goal. The goal of mini-games could be for example:  beating others in rock-paper-scissors to become a Viking,  hitting the table with your hand to &lsquo;stun&rsquo; other players, following the rules made by crazy king or not being the last to row a viking ship.&#10;&#10;Rules of each mini-game determine losers. As Drinking Viking is a party game and vikings celebrate the BIG VICTORY, losers normally consume a beverage. But you can play Stripping Viking as well as you can play it just by collecting black points which is another funny way to play.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all cards are played. Then the winner or winners are determined depending on a game type. Winner is a player who has lowest score or the player who has the most pieces of clothing or the player who drank less than others. It is very simple to recognize winners and losers.&#10;&#10;",

The Game begins shortly after a North African Tribal Leader has stirred up the natives in the whole region and are poised to launch assaults on French Settlements to drive them out of the Country forever. As the Commander of French Forces, you must protect the French Settlements and squash the rebellious Forces.&#10;&#10;OBJECTIVE: Game Objective: Player takes command of the French Forces in Morocco. The Player&rsquo;s Objective is to attempt to control a number of Arab Settlements whose Fortification Levels (FVs) total 18 or more before the Campaign Deck is exhausted. If the Arab Army captures a number of Settlements whose Fortification Values total 18 or more, the Arabs win. Also, if the French do not control 18 FV worth of Settlements before the Campaign Deck is exhausted, the Arabs Win.&#10;&#10;",

Each player also gets a number of partially randomly selected action tiles that can be used to replace numbers later in the game, swap two numbers or allow to create a solution with one duplicate number.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a random sum tile is drawn. Players then simultaneously try to create a solution for that sum on the board, using only their own action tiles for any changes to the numbers on the board and placing beginning/end markers for solutions. Numbers already used in previous solution can not be altered in any way. The player who comes up with a legal solution first scores points equal to the length of the solution and the solution is applied to the board. If the sum was odd, all players draw an additional action tile after the turn.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the players fail to find a solution for the third time. The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

Competing power companies are scrambling to extract as much PRISM as they can to increase their influence by powering districts and ultimately controlling the city's power needs.&#10;&#10;Activating a district card allows players to expand their power grid capabilities and also increases a company's influence.&#10;&#10;Instead of activating a district, a player could instead use the card's exchange ability to perform a powerful action at the cost of giving up the district, placed on The Exchange for others to take.&#10;&#10;Players take turn extracting PRISMs and using them to fulfill district contracts offered by the government. As players power districts, their play area will reflect the state of their city influence. When powering districts, players are rewarded for paying the exact amount, portraying efficiency and promoting careful planning.&#10;&#10;When a player activates their 8th district, the game enters the last round phase. At the end of the game, players with the highest influence points, earned by activated districts and their private agenda, are declared the winner.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The world of Midgaard, created by author Jaros&#197;&#130;aw Grz&#196;&#153;dowicz in The Lord of the Ice Garden novel series, is inhabited by a race very similar to humans, filled with magic and for a reason stuck at the cultural and technological level of medieval Viking world. The arrival of scientists from Earth disturbs its fragile balance. The power gained by controlling magic changes the scientists &ndash; they become possessed by the lust for making this world better. They become gods, who are willing to sacrifice any life, except for their own, of course, to accomplish their &ndash; great, according to them &ndash; ideas.&#10;&#10;Players impersonate the scientists struggling for the domination over The Coast of Sails and also for staying on Midgaard, because soon after them another person arrives to this world: Vuko Drakkainen, highly trained agent, whose task is to find the members of scientific expedition and send them back to Earth &mdash; or as a last resort make them vanish. Will the players, as powerful gods, allow him to do it?&#10;&#10;From the first turn, the players are tossed in the middle of war. They will feel the adrenaline, fear, pain and the heat of a battle. They will smell blood and sweat, hear the clash of arms and the moaning of wounded and dying.&#10;&#10;The Lord of the Ice Garden takes place on The Coast of Sails, which is divided into several regions. The main goal is fighting for the domination over those regions. A region is dominated by the player with the most influence in it. Dominating the region allows players to collect its resources (M-factor, gold, population), also to win victory points in specific turns, and to accomplish their own goals. Each player has unique winning conditions and special units.&#10;&#10;&#10;    Olaf Fjollsfinn &ndash; uses Ice Drakkars to seduce/kidnap six dwellers of The Coast of Sails to the Ice Garden.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Passionaria Callo &ndash; sends nightmares on the controlled regions and tries to isolate them. She needs to isolate two of them.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Pier van Dyken &ndash; greedy collector of M-factor. When he dominates a region with  a magical reserve, he may move it towards his headquarters, The Thorn. He needs to absorb four magical reserves.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Ulrike Freihoff &ndash; spreads her religion. When she dominates a region where she also has a special unit called The Enlightened One, she may build a Red Tower there. Six of those grant her victory.&#10;&#10;&#10;There is also Vuko, who came to evacuate the scientists and clean up their mess. Each turn he goes to the region, where the player with least reputation/morality (it decreases each time the player uses magic) has the most influence. Such a visit is nothing nice &ndash; Vuko kills one special unit of that player in this region and lowers his/her influence there.&#10;&#10;The game may end in one of the three ways:&#10;&#10;    Meeting the player's unique victory condition &ndash; the game ends and that player is the winner,&#10;    After specified number of turns game ends and the player with most victory points is the winner,&#10;    The Dead Snow token reaches the end of its track &ndash; each use of magic shakes the balance of Midgaard. If the players exceed the limit of changes that world and its gods can accept, the game ends and the winner is the player with the highest reputation.&#10;&#10;&#10;INITIATIVE PHASE:&#10;During the initiative phase players decide how many action tokens they will have for the current turn and also determine the player order during the Planning Phase. Moreover, they can initiate scoring of the regions by moving their initiative tokens. In the advanced mode they also determine the order of action fields resolution.&#10;&#10;PLANNING PHASE:&#10;Players, one by one in the order determined in the Initiative Phase, place their action tokens on selected action fields.&#10;&#10;ACTION PHASE:&#10;Players perform actions in the action fields, in the order determined by the placement of tokens.&#10;&bull; Viper's Nest &ndash; player receives one token of any resource. They can also exchange resources.&#10;&bull; Influence &ndash; player may sacrifice up to two population tokens to place as many influence tokens on the region(s) where they already have at least one influence&#10;&bull; Move &ndash; player may sacrifice up to two gold tokens to make as many moves of their influence tokens and/or special units to the neighboring region(s)&#10;&bull; Voracious Mountain &ndash; player may sacrifice population to move any number of their influence tokens and/or special units from one region to any other region&#10;&bull; Raven's Shadow &ndash; player may raise his/her reputation or use a magic token to get rid of the disadvantageous token of contact with Vuko.&#10;&bull; Magic &ndash; allows the player to do any of the three actions: translocate the M-factor, summon special units of the given level, add a new ability to the special unit. Each of those actions results in moving the Dead Snow token up on its track and decreasing the player's reputation.&#10;&bull; Activation (automatic field) &ndash; after resolving the actions players may activate the abilities of their special units. The order of activation of given abilities is strictly determined. After the activation the situation on the board may change drastically.&#10;&bull; Vuko Drakkainen (automatic field) &ndash; each turn Vuko must go to another region. Its figure is placed in the region, where the most immoral player has the most influence. That player receives a conact token decreasing his/her influence, and also loses one special unit in this region (provided he/she had any). In the advanced mode players will be able to equip Vuko with more abilities, that will activate in specific moments of the game.&#10;&#10;DOMINATION PHASE:&#10;Players collect victory points and resources from the regions, and accomplish their unique goals.&#10;&#10;",

The deck contains 54 item cards and 14 seismograph cards. The item cards show an item name, its volume, its weight, and its value. These quantities range from 1 to 5. The seismograph cards show a picture of a seismograph and a number from 1 to 5.&#10;&#10;To play, all the cards are shuffled together and the deck is cut into 4 face down piles. Players take turns using action points to uncover cards from the piles and add items to (or remove them from) their backpacks. The backpacks hold a maximum weight of 15 and a maximum volume of 15.&#10;&#10;When seismograph cards appear they are put in a separate pile. When the total of the numbers on these cards reaches 21, each player takes one final turn and the game ends.&#10;&#10;The winner of the game is the one who, at the end, has the most total value for the cards in his or her backpack.&#10;&#10;",

Unfortunately, humanity was no match for its own creations and armies of terrifying monsters were soon out of control in their destruction of civilization. In their final global nuclear strike, humanity accomplished two things: They wiped themselves out, and they created a highly mutagenic environment where the monsters could thrive.&#10;&#10;This is the world at the start of Teratozoic, a light deck-building game. (From greek: terato-, of or relating to monsters, -zoic, of a (specified) era, or having a (specified) animal mode of existence.) Each player has their own deck of monster parts (their gene pool), and will attempt to make the best of the mutations they draw from a common deck to come out on top in the battle for survival. At first the monsters will be more random mutation than representative of a stable gene pool (players will draw most of the cards for each hand from the common deck), but by the time players reach the Teratozoic Era, their monsters will be built entirely from the best traits they've been able to retain each generation.&#10;&#10;The dominant species in this new era (the final winner of the game) will be the one with the most robust gene pool&mdash;the player who can create the biggest, most impressive monsters at the end of the Teratozoic Era.&#10;&#10;",

Since I had no experience planning wedding party games, I went online to look for ideas, and found plenty of them that were extremely lame. I knew Nicky deserved better. I was playing a lot of Cards Against Humanity at the time, so was inspired to create a card game that honors the glorious institution that is matrimony, while also preparing my friend for the all frightening realities and ceremonial absurdity of humanity&rsquo;s most fraught life-long commitment. The game I made for Nicky on my laptop and home printer was as hilarious, embarrassing, depraved, and satisfying as marriage itself. So I decided I should share it with everyone.&#10;&#10;The game is simple to play: one person reads a question or fill-in-the-blank card aloud to a group of friends. Each player then gives an answer card that they think best responds. The reader picks the response they like best. The questions and clues are both a parody and a celebration of all our bizarre cultural hang-ups around weddings and marriage, and funny enough to make champagne squirt out your nose.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "DungeonQuest Revised Edition is a fast-paced game of dungeon exploration and looting for one to four players. You take on the role of a hero who sets out to explore Dragonfire Dungeon and claim more treasure than your rivals. Along the way, you'll need to evade traps, battle monsters, and find your way through the labyrinthian dungeon, all while trying to avoid waking the dragon who sleeps atop the treasure heap at the dungeon's heart. The player who gathers the most loot &ndash; and makes it out of the dungeon alive &mdash; is victorious!&#10;&#10;This new edition of DungeonQuest features a streamlined combat system that harkens back to the classic editions of the game, and a deadlier dungeon than ever before. The &quot;Torchlight&quot; variant offers you a new way to explore the dungeon's depths, while building an even more complex and sprawling dungeon throughout the game.&#10;&#10;",

Players, in the role of merchants, see this as an opportunity to make quick profits by selling goods in the bustling city during the Prince's visit. However, players must first get their goods through the city gate, which is under the watch of the Sheriff of Nottingham. Should you play it safe with legal goods and make a profit, or risk it all by sneaking in illicit goods? Be mindful, though, as the Sheriff always has his eyes out for liars and tricksters and if he catches one, he very well may confiscate those goods for himself!&#10;&#10;In Sheriff of Nottingham, players will not only be able to experience Nottingham as a merchant of the city, but each turn one player will step into the shoes of the Sheriff himself. Players declare goods they wish to bring into the city, goods that are secretly stored in their burlap sack. The Sheriff must then determine who gets into the city with their goods, who gets inspected, and who may have their goods confiscated!&#10;&#10;Do you have what it takes to be seen as an honest merchant? Will you make a deal with the Sheriff to let you in? Or will you persuade the Sheriff to target another player while you quietly slip by the gate? Declare your goods, negotiate deals, and be on the lookout for the Sheriff of Nottingham!&#10;&#10;Sheriff of Nottingham is the first game in the Dice Tower Essentials Line from Arcane Wonders.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "You are a superhero, virtuous, respected and dare we say loved by millions! Well, ok maybe not millions, but by more than a few people in the little town you and your super group have been tasked with protecting. Unfortunately, the government has cut your group's funding and that means you all are going to need jobs to support your superhero lifestyle. Sadly, there is but one job to be had in town at the local restaurant. The restaurant owner has decided to let you all tryout for the job and whoever has the most tips by the end of the day gets it.&#10;&#10;Born to Serve is a board game brawl between two to four jobless superheroes for the last job in town....at the local restaurant....waiting tables.  Oh how the mighty have fallen.&#10;&#10;In Born to Serve, players are recently unemployed second tier super heroes in competition for a single wait staff job at a restaurant.  Players serve tables by placing their time markers on them and ultimately the player who spends the most time on a table wins the table's tip. Players can also spend their time markers on the restaurant staff who allow them to use additional abilities to gain additional money or shift the odds in their favor on a table.  Of course, being super heroes, each player also has two (nominally useful) powers that allows them to bend certain strategies in their favor. The player who earns the most money in tips wins the job and the game.&#10;&#10;",

Many civilizations were already on the brink of collapse, and had already left their deteriorating home worlds behind in search of resources, peace, and solidarity.&#10;&#10;As new civilizations arrived in the TAU CETI system, they settled among the planets, terraforming them into more hospitable worlds. With this mass migration a new alliance was quickly formed, known as the TAU CETI Authority, which encouraged diplomacy among the different cultures and emerged as the new economic power.&#10;&#10;Trade began, with each civilization utilizing their strengths and comparative advantages to maximize productivity. Heralded among the civilizations, a sense of friendship, economic prosperity and peace enriched the star system.&#10;&#10;But all is not well. Soon after forming the alliance, unprecedented crises afflicted the colonized planets, causing civil unrest and economic disharmony. The fragile new alliance&rsquo;s existence is now being threatened! The most skilled Command Ship captains and emissaries from each race are being called upon to assemble a team of specialists, explore the star system for answers, and restore stability before all is lost.&#10;&#10;Tau Ceti: Planetary Crisis is a 1-5 player semi-cooperative game centered around an economic engine, asymmetric powers, and strategic manipulation. Tau Ceti tells a story of a newly formed alliance between several alien factions in a time of galactic declension, who compete for influence as they lead their civilization through a crisis-ridden star system.&#10;&#10;With multiple paths to victory, you are free to Explore the mysterious outer reaches of the star system for knowledge, Recruit Specialists to help you resolve crises, exploit opportunities through Trade, Buy/Sell commodities as the market fluctuates across planets, Complete Missions for money, Build Orbitals and Defend them against enemies, Acquire Exotic Technologies, and Upgrade your starship's systems for greater advantages as you navigate the cosmic environment.&#10;&#10;Tau Ceti has all the elements of a 4X game, but allows you to advance at your own pace with &agrave; la carte advanced rules, and can be played in 1-2 hours.

Each card is broken up into two halves and each half has a scoring orb on it.&#10;&#10;You have a handful of cards and you try to attach them to cards that have already been played. It is simple to add a card next to another, but then both players continue to score. Overlapping cards is much more difficult, but then you cover up their scoring orbs. Only uncovered orbs score at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Laying new cards follow a simple set of rules:&#10;&#10;1) Connectors on connecting edges must match in number (0, 1, 2, or 3 lines.)&#10;2) New tiles can be placed next to a tile, or overlapping one half of other tiles.&#10;3) A tile may not completely cover another fully exposed tile.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to have the most visible scoring orbs.&#10;&#10;Make sure you end up on top.&#10;&#10;",

However, don&rsquo;t worry, they can&rsquo;t get there either, because you&rsquo;ve just punctured the tyres on their bike.&#10;&#10;Wing It is a great fun family board game, requiring a little cunning, some guile and the employment of underhand tactics in order to win. Utilising official RSPB illustrations, calling on the experience of RSPB wardens and using actual RSPB reserves, Wing It  combines an authentic birdwatching game with family entertainment.&#10;&#10;You might ruffle a few feathers but remember the early bird wins.&#10;&#10;",

The player who does not succeed, loses a point.&#10;&#10;The tasks (presented on 64 cards) include pretending to be someone else, making faces, speaking in funny voices, telling stories, feeding other players with snacks, proposing toasts, drinking, etc.&#10;&#10;",

The players are in a race to capture the balls before their competition do and 3 challenge cards mix up the requirements for each round.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to collect as many bits of kibble (colored balls) as you can before the other players snatch them up. To add another level of difficulty, players can also choose to only eat certain colors of kibble or only 1 piece of kibble in each color for those puppies who are on a diet.&#10;&#10;Not only is the game fun for children and their parents but the game can also be educational as it promotes colour recognition, counting skills and hand-eye co-ordination.&#10;&#10;The game is well constructed also with holes in the bottom of the puppy cups that allow the balls to slip into the cups when they are banged down on top of the balls.&#10;&#10;",

Use your knowledge of language semantics to simplify the meaning of &lsquo;big&rsquo; words into &lsquo;small&rsquo; ones. For example, if the &lsquo;big&rsquo; word on the card was countenance, the &lsquo;small&rsquo; word could be visage or expression.&#10;So let the battle of the minds commence and it will be clear who is the victor and has the greater understanding of the English Language.&#10;A great little game for airplanes, train or car journeys, or perhaps you could make it some sort of drinking game!&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Players can then move Olivia around the board by swapping her card with other cards. The board gets progressively smaller as the game goes on, a mechanic you need to use to your advantage to knock out other players or end rounds while you're ahead on points. Drawn cards allow you to move Olivia, discard cards from the board, secretly swap the card in your hand with one on the board, and, eventually, have Olivia catch other players who are not protected by any cards between them and her!&#10;&#10;Every round the cards that are available change, so your strategy can switch between heavy offense, strategic card removals, and unofficial alliances with other players to knock out those who are further ahead. If two or more players survive the round, the values of their discarded cards determine the winner.&#10;&#10;",

One player flips over the top card, which depicts colored objects &ndash; trains, birds, cups, etc. &ndash; stacked vertically or horizontally, then everyone tries to recreate this colored sequence with her own set of cups. The first player to do slams the bell, revels in the soul-brightening &quot;ding&quot;, then (if correct), claims the card. Someone then reveals the next card, and the players start shuffling cups once again.&#10;&#10;In Speed &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;Cups&sup2; you don't only have to arrange your cups in horizontal and vertical stacks, but you also have to make different stacks!&#10;&#10;",

The core rules are fairly straightforward, and a game can be completed in 90 minutes. The game is played over three turns; in each turn you whizz around the planets and moons claiming tiles. The tiles grant you cards, allow you to build a factory or mine, let you hunt strange beasts, or simply earn you some money. Other tiles allow you to attack other players or add to the crisis level on the planet/moon in question. You have to be careful with crisis tiles as if you let too many build up, bad stuff &mdash; Martian invasions, robot rebellions, space pirates, etc. &mdash; starts happening.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Mutology is a brand new strategy card game that transforms players into Mutologists, bioengineers obsessed with creating extraordinary creatures in their laboratories. Players will fire Radiation cards at their Specimens, and depending on what combinations of Radiation they're exposed to, Specimens will turn into one of two unique Mutants. Some Mutants are hyper aggressive, others have defense mechanisms, and some manipulate the way you or your opponent can play the game! You collect Research Points at the start of each turn for every Mutant you have in play, and the first player to 5 points wins.&#10;&#10;Players mutate their Specimens by firing one of three kinds of Radiation, (Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Rays) at their Specimen cards. Each Specimen card comes with a unique ingredient list called &quot;mutation requirements.&quot; Alone, Radiation cards give perks to the Specimen such as boosting their Power or Stability. Whenever a Specimen has met one of its mutation requirements, they would mutate into the corresponding Mutant card, which would wait outside of play until this moment.&#10;&#10;Apart from Specimens and Mutants, player can build Devices like the Electric Coil and the Transmogrifier, or use Procedures like Brainstorm and Devolution. Lab Assistants like the Medic, Technician, and Researcher can lend their talents to you throughout the game as well. There are two zones of play in which cards can be placed: the Field Zone and the Lab Zone. These cards behave differently in each zone, so Mutology games always have a bit of tactical placement strategy involved.&#10;&#10;",

They are vulgar, sexual, positional, provocative, and just crazy. You will ask yourself, &quot;do people actually do these things?&quot; at least once every game.&#10;&#10;But watch out, not every card in the Dictionary is Lewd and Obscene. Your creativity may get ahead of yourself. In that sense, you'll need to &quot;get your mind out of the gutter.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;Lewd and Obscene is an adult party game.&#10;&#10;The game begins by picking a card from the Dictionary. The word is read aloud but the definition remains a mystery to everyone except the picker.&#10;&#10;Players try their best to define the word. They write their made-up definition to the word on their &quot;Definition Slip&quot;.&#10;&#10;When all players are finished defining words, the slips are turned in, mixed up, and read aloud. After all definitions have been read, voting takes place.&#10;&#10;When voting, tally points on the definition slip. If you convince a player to vote for your definition, you receive one (1) point. If you vote for the correct definition, you receive two (1) points. Once all the scores are collected, the next player picks a new card and starts all over.&#10;&#10;Upon starting, you will all agree to a score to end on and once that has been reached, you will have your winner.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Christina Regina - the Board Game is a game about politics and intrigues in 17th century Sweden where each player represents a faction with a hidden agenda. The end of their intrigues is the newly appointed queen Christina of Sweden and their means include persuasion, agitation, manipulation and even assassination. This is achieved by carefully steering the queen towards influence tiles bearing their faction colors and away from other influence tiles. At the same time, they must closely monitor the other players' actions to guess their agendas. But beware, if your own agenda is too obvious, you may yourself become the victim of your opponents' intrigues!&#10;&#10;Game mechanisms include:&#10;&#10;1. Tile laying: Tiles are laid at the start of the game and make every session unique. &#10;2. Asymmetric scoring: There are no &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; tiles but they all score differently for different players. &#10;3. Hidden agendas: The players do not know how much the other players score until the very end. &#10;4. Guessing game: Based on how players play, the other players may gain points by guessing their agendas (or lose points by guessing wrong).&#10;&#10;Christina Regina is the third game in the Nova Suecia series.&#10;&#10;",

The players take on the roles of shipyard leaders in 17th century Stockholm who have been given a royal order - the building and launching of the greatest battle ship ever seen. But to manage the delivery, they must procure goods, craft them into building material and use them to build the ship. At the same time, they must make a profit by secretly deciding how much to use for the ship and how much to keep for themselves. The players' total contribution determines the fate of the ship. If she is successful, the player who put most aside wins but if she is a disaster, only the player who put most into the ship will be spared the King's wrath. Each player must thus closely monitor the other players' strategies to determine whether to spend or to save. The victory conditions will not be clear until the game is over - but then it is too late to change the strategy.&#10;&#10;Game mechanisms include:&#10;&#10;1. Role-based: The players choose roles to perform actions, actions that give some players more benefits than others. &#10;2. Economic balance: The players need to balance between the good types (wood, cloth, iron and sculptures) so that they always have something to work with. &#10;3. Ambiguous victory conditions: The victory conditions depend on the sum of the players' actions and will not be clear until the game ends. &#10;4. Guessing game: A player strategy is not visible to the other players and must be deduced from their actions.&#10;&#10;Vasa Regalis is the fourth game in the Nova Suecia series.&#10;&#10;",

In the game, you will find that energy production, water consumption, and climate change are tightly intertwined. We call this the Nexus of Energy, Water, and Climate. This nexus makes it hard to get what you want and requires making trade-offs to win.&#10;&#10;As governor, you will accumulate energy sources to provide for the transportation and electricity needs of your citizens. You will have a wide range of energy sources to choose from, both hydrocarbon-based and renewable. But, watch out! Every kind of energy source requires water and has an environmental impact on climate, land, water or living things. You will have limited water resources and a cap on your environmental impact, making it challenging to reach your energy goal. Energy sources like coal and oil will produce a lot of energy, but also use up a lot of water and have a big environmental impact. Renewable sources use less water and have lower environmental impact, but generate much less energy.&#10;&#10;ACTION cards (TECHNOLOGY, POLICY, AND CLIMATE IMPACT) bring in real-world developments that change the course of the game and force players to quickly adapt their strategy. Buying technology gives you an advantage, while implementing policies can set your opponent back, and climate impacts wreak havoc on everyone. Strategy is critical along with negotiating trades throughout the game. Getting the right mix of energy sources and technology boosts for your region can be easier with negotiations and trades than taking your chances drawing from the deck.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "1919: The Noble Experiment is a complex card game for up to four people (yes, you can have a lot of fun with just two!). A match typically takes around 45 minutes. The goal of the game is to collect as much Prestige points as possible, which is achieved by delivering contraband whisky to the city's pubs. To do so you need to perform a number of actions starting with buying ingredients at the local market, distilling whisky from them, bottling your whisky as well as finding and hiring a driver to pick up your order. Other players can disrupt your plans and gain the advantage, giving them the victory. That&rsquo;s why you need to be ready for anything, including being punished by a law-abiding mayor that will confiscate our wares. Unless we get lucky and have a chance to bribe him first&hellip;.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

With your Captain card to guide you, put together the best team you can from names across all 30 NHL teams. Every card features the stars of the NHL in high-resolution action shots. Can you light the lamp enough times to win the game?&#10;&#10;Compete for the best attackers, the best defenders, the best skills, and the best maneuver cards. Each card you add to your team will build upon the strategy you have chosen. Soon your team will act like a well-oiled machine and you&rsquo;ll be ready to take a shot on goal. If you can beat the goalie, you score a point! The player who scores the most points wins. Games typically end with &quot;hockey scores&quot; like 4-3.&#10;&#10;When you take a shot on goal, the action is tense. Before you reveal all of the tricks up your sleeve, there is a chance for defenders to interfere with your attack. The more defenders that get in your way, the harder it will be to score. After the defenders (if any) have been revealed, you play out your hand. That&rsquo;s right! The defenders won&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s crashing the net until after they have coordinated their defense. Now that you know what you&rsquo;re up against, play your cards and see if your strategy and players were good enough to overcome the defenses and the goalie. If it is, you score!&#10;&#10;",

In order to save him and to gain a never ending grant from him, you will travel through the Theben Necropolis to the Karnak Temple Complex and, in the end, you will enter the Royal Palace to defeat the conspirators! The setting, philological correct, reproduce the real story told in the Judicial Papyrus of Turin, held in the Egyptian Museum of Turin.&#10;&#10;To cross the Nile and get to the next area you need to get enough power, fame and wealth to gain a level and the pertaining title; you can increase those stats by com pleating a specific quest or by chance, slot by slot, by facing the card(s) you will draw: only if you have the right title you can enter the Temple or the Royal Palace!&#10;&#10;During the game you can trade with other characters simply being in the same spot, but beware of the hired assassin hiding among you. At the beginning of the game, each player draw one of the eight tiles from a sack and hide it to others: the bloody tile changes your goal from save to slay the Pharaoh. When the hired assassin meets another character, he/she can choose to kill the other character or to pretend to be like anyone else.&#10;&#10;",

A breach between dimensions has opened at the edge of the galaxy, and the Anti-Bodies, a race of horrible interdimensional space monsters, are spilling out and threatening to consume everything in their path if left unchecked. That's where you come in! You and a couple friends can take control of one of fifteen giant robots from all across the Milky Way, equip an arsenal of futuristic weaponry, and mow down the horde. And although everyone is working towards the same goal, killing some enemies will bring you more recognition from others when it's time for the Senator to hand out the medals...&#10;&#10;Gameplay consists of rounds of play, called waves, in which a random number of enemy cards are dealt out of a deck to each player. Then, players take turns making attack rolls using up to three different colored dice, which correspond to enemy types (for example, red dice can only deal damage to red enemies, etc.). After all attacks have been made by players, any surviving enemies counterattack, then remain in play during the next wave.&#10;&#10;The primary goal is to work with your teammates to deplete the 100 card enemy deck entirely, but in addition to that each enemy a player kills is worth anywhere from one to six points. So, while players are competing against each other for points, they are also required to work together to prevent a total party loss.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Tixel is a combinatorial game for two players. The name comes from the playing pieces, which are basically pixels (squares) with a curved indentation on one of their edges. Tixels are &quot;directional&quot;, meaning that their orientation is relevant.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player can either place a new tixel or move one of her own tixels already on the board. A tixel can be &quot;active&quot; or &quot;inactive&quot;; only active tixels, which are at a 45&ordm; angle, may be moved. Making tixels inactive is done by moving next to or passing an active tixel.&#10;&#10;Chaining moves is important as this temporarily unlocks three additional move types (aside from placing or moving a piece). If a tixel that is moved is made inactive at its end position &mdash; i.e., it's sacrificed &mdash; a player can take an extra move if she so chooses; aside from placing or moving a tixel, she can now remove a tixel from the board, activate an inactive tixel, or pivot an active tixel to reorient its hollow side.&#10;&#10;Tixel: Tix Expansion Pieces consists of four extra pieces for each player. These expansion pieces are different from regular pieces in that they are completely square instead of being hollow on one side. For each expansion piece used, remove one tixel from the game. The expansion pieces can be used to add variety to games, but they can also be used to handicap a stronger player. Simply give the stronger player more expansion pieces compared to the weaker player. With two expansion sets, the original Tix game can also be played on the Tixel board.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Two games in one package.&#10;&#10;&#10;1914: Glory's End&#10;&#10;Before the award-winning World War I designs Paths of Glory and The Great War In Europe, Deluxe Edition, designer Ted S. Raicer had revived interest in gaming the Great War with a series of WWI campaign games for the late lamented Command magazine. GMT is proud to present a set of revised boxed editions of these classic &ldquo;players-games&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;In August 1914, Imperial Germany gambled its future on a rapid conquest of France, designed to free up the German army within six weeks to face the Russian steamroller of France&rsquo;s Tsarist ally on the eastern front. Seven German armies deployed opposite five French armies, the army of &ldquo;plucky little Belgium&rdquo;, and the &ldquo;Old Contemptibles&rdquo; of the British Expeditionary Force in a series of battles that turned August and September 1914 into the bloodiest months of the entire war.&#10;&#10;1914: Glory&rsquo;s End covers the first three months of the Great War on the western front, from the Guns of August to First Ypres. This oft-gamed campaign receives a unique treatment, emphasizing playability without compromising on historical feel. Units are mostly corps of four steps (two counters per unit), along with a few especially strong (or weak) brigades and divisions, along with counters for the feared German Krupp and Skoda guns. The corps level Order of Battle accurately reflects the operational doctrine of the campaign, while also limiting the number of counters on the map to an easy-to-manage level.&#10;&#10;The game scale is 9.5 miles per hex and three days per turn. The campaign game runs a full 30 turns, but the new edition will include not only a previously published mini-scenario on the Battle of the Marne, but a short ten turn campaign scenario covering the decisive opening weeks of the war. In addition the campaign games can be played in historical or free set-up versions.&#10;&#10;1914: Glory&rsquo;s End uses an Igo-Hugo system with two types of combat to demonstrate the tactical realities of the campaign: Prepared Combat and March Combat. Prepared Combat allows you to bring all your adjacent units to bear against a defending hex, but only with units that don&rsquo;t move. This gives the defender time to reinforce, retreat, or pre-empt your combat with his own attack. To avoid this, you can &ldquo;attack off the march&rdquo; during your movement, but March Combat may only be delivered by a single stack at a time, limiting the force you can bring to bear. Furthermore, March Combat cannot be used against entrenched enemy units.&#10;&#10;The coming of trench warfare is reflected by a unique Entrenchment rule: starting on turn 10 players may entrench one or two hexes per turn, PLUS any hexes adjacent to enemy trenches. The result is that trenches appear first as a tactical consideration, but then turn into a strategic problem as they spread with ever-increasing rapidity along the front.&#10;&#10;1914: Glory&rsquo;s End manages to cover all the important characteristics of the campaign (with rules for forts, cavalry, command and control breakdowns, supply, strategic rail movement, Allied sea movement, German forced marching, Plan XVII, Paris in Danger! and more) while remaining easy to play. The new GMT version will of course incorporate all errata from the original edition, but adds updated artwork, a corrected historical campaign Order of Battle, additional scenarios, and a tweaked set of rules.&#10;&#10;&#10;When Eagles Fight&#10;&#10;Before the award-winning World War I designs Paths of Glory and The Great War In Europe, Deluxe Edition, designer Ted S. Raicer had revived interest in gaming the Great War with a series of WWI campaign games for the late lamented Command magazine. GMT is proud to present a set of revised boxed editions of these classic &ldquo;players-games&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;Winner of the Charles S. Roberts award for best pre-WWII boardgame, When Eagles Fight covers the eastern front in World War I, the last war of Tsarist Russia, Habsburg Austria, and Imperial Germany. From 1914 to 1917 the armies of the Tsar battled from the Carpathians to the Baltic against the outnumbered but logistically superior German army and the badly-led multi-ethnic forces of Austria-Hungary (the Central Powers). Though repeatedly inflicting massive defeats on the Habsburg armies, the Russians were ultimately undone by the skill and firepower of the German army and the collapsing political structure of the Tsarist autocracy. By March 1917 the 300 year-old Romanov dynasty was no more, and the stage was set for the coming of Lenin and the Bolsheviks. But the empire of the Habsburgs was left mortally wounded, and the Kaiser&rsquo;s Germany would meet its own doom less than two years later on the battlefields of the western front.&#10;&#10;When Eagles Fight recreates this titanic struggle from the initial clashes at Tannenberg and in Galicia to the revolution that brought down Tsar Nicholas II. The large-hex map covers the eastern front of the Great War from the northern tip of Romania to Petrograd, and from Berlin to Smolensk at a scale of 25 miles to the hex. Turns represent one or two months, and combat units range from division to (mostly) corps.&#10;&#10;When Eagles Fight has a set of low-complexity rules, without sacrificing the historical elements of this unique theater of the Great War. The combat results table is bloody and attritional, but allows for breakthroughs with the right tactics or artillery support. The greater operational skills of the German army is shown in the use of the OberOst HQ, which allows additional attacks on a select part of the front. The Russian supreme headquarters, Stavka, in turn has the ability to concentrate their limited supplies to overcome logistical shortages. And the surprise tactics of the Brusilov Offensive can allow a late game victory over the Austrians.&#10;&#10;Other rules cover the slow pace of Russian mobilization, Austrian Lock-Step Planning in the opening days of the war, German heavy artillery, fortifications, Russian Guards forces, Cavalry Retreats, and the effects of events on other fronts.&#10;&#10;But the new edition of When Eagles Fight is more than just a reprint of the original version. The Random Events Table has been exchanged for a system of random events chits allowing for more events. The effects if the Germans do not launch a Verdun offensive in France-which sometimes threw off the balance of the original design- have been revised. Changes in the stacking rules after 1914 more accurately reflect the effect of trenches on the course of the campaigns. And the map now contains the rail lines removed by Command from the first edition. The game also includes a short alternative-history scenario in which the bulk of the German army goes east rather than west in August 1914.&#10;&#10;These changes make this an improved edition of an already award-winning design. Tense, historical, and just plain fun, When Eagles Fight is a game that belongs in the collection of everyone with an interest in the Great War!&#10;&#10;",

Player TWO likewise makes ONE 2-or-more letter word and places in in his play area. However, in addition, he may steal words from other players' areas by adding one or more of the remaining letters in formation to those words (inserting at any point of word or optionally rearranging the letters in those words). Multiple play-ons are allowed each turn, and players can &quot;play on&quot; their own words also. Play continues with the next player. When any stack is depleted of cards, face up cards from other stacks with multiple cards are slid over to occupy open position and underneath card is flipped over to be face up.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player with the most letters in his play area when all cards in the 8 stack formation are depleted.&#10;&#10;80 cards total in deck.

On his turn a player either places one of his pieces onto an open square of the grid or captures an opposing piece by jumping it. A player is forced to jump a piece if his opponent placed the piece next to the player's piece. Play ends either when one player achieves four pieces in a row or when no player has enough pieces left to form four in a row. Players score four points for completing four in a row and one point for each captured piece. Play multiple rounds until one player reaches twenty one points&#10;&#10;",

He is dealt six more cards, chooses three of those for his hand, and places the remaining three face-up onto his table cards in three separate stacks. One player begins by placing a card or cards of the same value from his hand onto the table face-up to create a discard pile. The other players in turn must place onto the discard stack a card or cards of the same value that match(es) or exceed(s) the value of the top card of the stack; or else, pick up the stack. Until the draw pile is gone, players must draw at the end of their turns to maintain a hand of at least three cards.&#10;&#10;All of a player's hand cards must be played before any of his face-up table cards, which must in turn be played before any of his face-down table cards. A few cards allow players to break the foregoing rules. The last player with cards loses the game.&#10;&#10;Karma is based on the public domain card game, Palace.&#10;&#10;",

Lang.&#10;&#10;In this game &mdash; which features Wolverine, Magneto, Cyclops, Iceman, Psylocke, the Sentinels and more &mdash; each player fields a superhero team, with each hero being represented by custom-tooled dice; each team must be composed of 15 dice, and a player can &quot;purchase&quot; dice only from his team. Each hero also has one or more character reference cards, which show the special abilities for the characters based on the die rolls. Different versions of these cards will be available in booster packs, allowing for more customization of your team. Players use these dice to collect energy, recruit new heroes, and battle head-to-head. In addition, each player brings two basic action cards to the game, which are placed in the center of the table; both players can purchase these cards. A player wins once the opposing player has been reduced to zero life.&#10;&#10;The Marvel Dice Masters: Uncanny X-Men starter set comes with 44 custom dice, 38 cards, two dice bags, and a core rulebook. Booster packs include two dice with two matching character cards.&#10;&#10;",

It is a trick-taking game in the vein of Wizard or Oh Hell. Players bid simultaneously on the number of tricks they will take each hand. They receive a ten point bonus for being correct, zero for overbidding, and points equal to the number of tricks taken for underbidding. A player receives an additional bonus if he is dealt a special card, bids the amount shown on the card, and then makes the bid. The game ends after ten rounds. High score wins.&#10;&#10;",

The game begins on day D+1, November 8, 2004. While fighting in Fallujah continued until the end of December, this game portrays the first seven days of battle in which Coalition forces took the most territory and faced the fiercest resistance. This simulation is intended to represent a modern, urban counterinsurgency operation.&#10;&#10;As a player, your goal is to clear Fallujah of insurgents while searching the city, block-by-block. Time is of the essence. Meanwhile, you must maintain the political will and support of both the American and Iraqi governments. You will be combating insurgents whose goal is to inflict as many casualties as possible and force American 'infidels' from their city, and eventually, country. The conflict is contained within the city of Fallujah.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

It is a fun card-driven character building game featuring a hilarious uncontrolled narrative that unfolds differently every time.&#10;&#10;As an aspiring super villain, you are trying to make your mark in the world. In Villainy you are trying to be the first villain to complete three plans to beat Fantastiman, that pesky super-hero who watches over the city day and night. You must hire minions to aid you in your quest for world domination. You will have to do crimes and go to work as your alter ego to learn the skills necessary and gain the cards required to see your great plans through to their triumphant end.&#10;&#10;Today is the day that Fantastiman will fall...&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Mechanics Description:&#10;&#10;In Villainy, players gradually build a stronger team of villains. Each turn, players typically perform a single action which may include purchasing a new team member with money, increasing one of four team member's stats, earning money, and completing objectives.&#10;&#10;Each team member has three primary stats: strength, charisma, and intelligence. In addition, they can each acquire 6 abilities such as a scientific knowledge or the possession of a weapon. Team members can also gain an additional special action and extra income by purchasing an alter ego card such as a software engineer.&#10;&#10;Players draw an initial objective card that describes minimum statistics and abilities a team must have to complete that objective. Players then spend turns building their team to meet those requirements. There is a pool of characters a player can purchase with money. There is another pool of crimes and alter ego cards that a player can select and which will provide money or increase a team member's stats. These pools will cycle throughout the game and choosing which cards to select and which characters to purchase are important to building a strong team.&#10;&#10;Once the requirements are met, they may spend a turn to complete the objective. The first two objectives are met simply by having a team with the right requirements. The third in addition to having these requirements includes a mechanic where the team fights against Fantastiman. During this third and last objective, players will draw random challenge cards that may decrease their team stats and abilities. If the team overcomes these challenges and still meets the minimum requirements, they can then complete the fight by rolling a high value with a dice.&#10;&#10;The first player to complete all three objectives is the winner.&#10;&#10;There are additional challenges or fights which occur both randomly and as a player's action throughout the game. Typically these fights award a bonus to one player without hurting another. It is these challenges and several special abilities that steal from other players that make up the majority of player to player direct conflict.&#10;&#10;",

Climb aboard any one of Lydon Rail Company&rsquo;s four railways and race to be the first train to successfully deliver $1,000,000 in resources! Be wary of what lies ahead, as setbacks are bound to happen! Tariffs will slow our delivery, maintenance will stop you in your tracks and hijackers are eager to steal your payload! Fix what you can, deliver the goods and attain victory!&#10;&#10;Gameplay Overview:&#10;&#10;Each player chooses one of four unique railways each with a unique advantage. During a turn, a player has up to 4 available actions, Draw, Transport, Remedy, and Sabotage, each of which will either bring you closer to victory or slow down your opponents. Your main goal is to accumulate $1,000,000 in resources before another player beats you to it. Denominations range from $25,000 to $250,000, so keep a look out for highly valued resources. But it isn't as simple as drawing and transporting resources...Setbacks can bring you to a halt. Remedy them quick to keep moving! Game play is quick, with each player allowed up to 3 actions per turn! You may draw, transport and sabotage in a turn, Draw twice and then remedy, or if you are feeling notorious, Sabotage three times! A 2-player game usually lasts about 10-15 minutes. Add a third and expect a bit longer.&#10;&#10;",
