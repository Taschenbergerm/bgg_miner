If he hits a goal, he uses the next meeple. The movement of the meeples is determined by a die. When a ball gets on a space of its own color it gets kicked forward along the arrow. If it gets on a space of the opponents color, it gets kicked back. The game board has two sides, a simple one and one that's more complex.&#10;&#10;The game was made in GDR.&#10;&#10;",

If it's a dragon tile, she places it on the first empty space on the dragon path; if a path tile, she places it at the end of a path already on the board. (The first path tile is placed in the upper-left square of the game board, while the treasure is below the lower-right square.) If the path is placed on a key, the players claim the key. If the path crosses the candies, the players can place one dragon tile on the candies, delaying the dragon on its way to the treasure.&#10;&#10;Once the players have collected three keys, they can then lay a tile on the treasure chest &mdash; and if they reach the treasure before the dragon does, they win!&#10;&#10;",

Each player controls two lemmings that must make their way across a game board of hexagonal spaces; most spaces contain grassland and can be entered no matter which card a player lays down, but some spaces contain special terrain (water, hills, etc.) that can be entered only when the appropriate card is played.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with 2-6 cards in hand, with the number dependent on the player count. On a turn, a player either:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Discards any number of cards from hand, then refills her hand to six cards, or&#10;    Plays a card, then moves one of her lemmings.&#10;&#10;&#10;Each card is one of five landscape types and numbered 0-4. If the card played is equal to or lower than the value of the top landscape card of the same type, then the player adds the values of all landscape cards of this type, then moves her lemming up to this many spaces, crossing grassland and the depicted landscape type freely. If the card is higher than the top card of the depicted landscape type, then discard all cards of this type and start a new pile. Before moving her lemming, though, she places a bonus landscape hex of this type on the game board &mdash; ideally stifling the future movement of her opponents while scooting her own lemming further toward the goal.&#10;&#10;If one or more lemmings are in your intended path of movement, you can push them aside before moving into the space, spending one point of movement for each lemming so moved. You can push your own lemming, if you set them up right &mdash; even across the finish line.&#10;&#10;The first player to move both of her lemmings across the finish line wins.&#10;&#10;",

Turn the top card face-up and place it near the starting cards. If anyone spots an item &mdash; or multiple items &mdash; that appears on two or three cards, she yells out the combined sum of all items that appear on two or three cards. For example, if three bananas appear on one card and two on another, yell out &quot;Five!&quot;; if in addition one pear appears on a card and one pear appears on another, yell out &quot;Seven!&quot; Each player can yell out at most one number, and whoever first yells the correct sum claims one of the face-up cards, then replaces it with the top card of the deck. Whoever claims the most cards wins.&#10;&#10;With younger players, you can lay out only two cards at a time to keep the sums smaller and minimize the calculation; with older players, keep four cards in play, possibly adding more cards to the deck to make the game last longer.&#10;&#10;",

Whenever the pasture (Sheep deck) is empty, the game is over and whoever has the most sheep in their pen is the winner.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you will draw a card from the duty deck, and then you will perform two actions.  Those actions are A) drawing a card from the duty deck B) playing a card from your hand or C) herding a sheep aka taking the top card from the sheep deck and putting it in your pasture.&#10;&#10;Some of the sheep cards are rare sheep such as the Ninja Sheep, the Fat Sheep, the Buff Sheep, or the Goat. Each special sheep has a special ability printed on the card.  Most of the sheep in the sheep deck are normal mundane sheep, however.&#10;&#10;In the 30 min game some of the cards you will draw (duty cards) will help you herd more sheep or perform more actions, but many of the duty cards are harmful to your opponents, such as sending feral corgis to kidnap their sheep or even worse, infecting an opponent with rabies.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In Gone Viking, you want to become the richest viking in the clan, competing against the other players as you raid and pillage for valuable resources, call upon the Nordic gods to aid you with their divine powers, and do your best to avoid the nasty Jarl who always taxes the one Viking who returns home with the most plunder!&#10;&#10;At its heart, Gone Viking is a trick-taking card game for 3-5 players. However, judge not! In this game you have to take the right tricks at strategic times to get yourself into the best position each round. With a double-edged-sword resource collection element, Gone Viking elevates itself as a uniquely competitive game, and one that reminds players of what it was like to be a viking raider.&#10;&#10;In more detail, each round players receive a hand of cards, with the leader then swapping up to four cards for free. After trump is declared, all players can pay to swap cards. As players win tricks, they can plunder resource tokens that are used to win the game. During the trick-taking phase, players can add multiple cards together to increase their total and play viking god cards to use those special powers. The last standing viking god in a round provides an additional benefit to its owner, and the richest player in a round will find half his wealth taken by Jarl &mdash; so aim for second place in order to keep your goods.&#10;&#10;",

You will never play the same game twice, so you will always be challenged to adapt your strategy to the layout of the board.&#10;&#10;Each board space displays a value from zero to four. This value indicates how many adjacent spaces you must control to claim that space. Take turns competing with your opponent to take spaces that allow new moves while also limiting your opponent's options.&#10;&#10;Quot encourages players to anticipate their opponent's moves and develop a strategy to secure the largest area as possible. If you claim enough space to run your opponent out of possible moves, you win!&#10;&#10;",

If someone else plays the same amount of cards with a higher number, however, your cards get nicked! Stealing cards can be good, but if you can't use them later, and end the game with cards in hand, they'll cost you points.&#10;&#10;In more detail, the deck contains 104 number cards (1-13 x8) and five joker cards. Each player starts with a hand of 13 cards, and six cards are laid face-up next to the deck. On a turn, a player lays down one or more cards of the same value, adding jokers if desired; if she already has cards on the table, she lays these cards so that previously played cards are still visible. If any opponent has most recently played the same number of cards and those cards are of a lower value, then the active player &quot;abluxxes&quot; those opponents &mdash; that is, the active player can take the abluxxed cards into her hand and the opponent then draws the same number of cards, either from the display or the deck; if she doesn't take these cards in hand, then the opponent either returns these cards to his hand or discards them and draws that many cards. Refill the display only after someone finishes drawing cards. (Jokers can be played on their own, and they are considered to be higher than all values.)&#10;&#10;As soon as the deck runs out of cards or a player has no cards in hand, the game ends immediately, even if the player would normally abluxx an opponent. Each player scores one point for each card on the table in front of him, then loses one point for each card in hand. Whoever has the highest score wins. If players wish, they can play multiple rounds and sum their scores over the rounds to determine a winner.&#10;&#10;",

The deck contains every president from &#10;George Washington to Barack Obama. Each president is given a hit point value based &#10;on real life statistics determined by time spent in office, popularity and war experience. &#10;On every battle card we added facts about  each president. Our country's complete &#10;leadership over the past 200+ years packed into one game.&#10;&#10;This game is easy to learn and fun for all ages young old and with so many card &#10;combinations, this game has unlimited replay value and should never be the same &#10;game twice. Each card represents a different time and era in American history&#10;&#10;Rules of War&#10;&#10;2 Player&#10;&#10;Each player chooses their favorite die- Republican, Democrat or Independent (red, white or blue)&#10;&#10;Shuffle the deck and deal each player 22 cards. -Do not look at them- Place them in a pile face down in front of you. Both players turn over the top card on their pile and battle. If your card wins the battle you place it on the bottom of your pile for future use and if your card loses you put it in a separate pile, this card is no longer playable. A player wins when they successfully defeat their opponent's entire army.&#10;&#10;1 player&#10;&#10;Choose between 1 and 6 cards from the deck either by random or by choice and these will be your battle cards. Play through the deck to see how many presidents you can eliminate before you are taken out. Keep track of your score on score pad.&#10;&#10;Rules of Battle&#10;&#10;Each player rolls their die at the same time. The player who rolls the higher number gets the strike. The damage= difference in dice. Opponent then must subtract it from their battle card. The battle is over when one card loses all their hit points or an eagle is rolled.&#10;&#10;Example - If player 1 rolls a (7) player and player 2 rolls a (1)......Then player 2 must subtract 6 from their card.&#10;&#10;Battle Dice- 10 Sided- Numbered 2-9 with 2 symbols&#10;&#10;Eagle- If you roll an eagle, you steal your player's card and place it on the bottom of your pile.&#10;&#10;Shield- If you roll a shield you defend your opponent's attack and they must subtract their total roll from their battle card&#10;&#10;",

Shuffle the dice cards, then deal two to each player. On a turn, a player plays one die card (which shows values from 1 to 6), then either starts a new row of cards or adds to an existing row.&#10;&#10;&#10;    To start a new row, take the card showing this number from the display and place it in front of you; when starting a row, you can choose to play both die cards instead of only one.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    To add to a row, add the die value played to the number on the top card of one of your rows, then take this card from the display.&#10;&#10;&#10;If another player has used a desired card in one of her rows, steal it from her row and use it for yourself. You can have at most three rows in progress. At the end of your turn draw back up to two die cards.&#10;&#10;When you play a die card to place the 40 card on a row, you then score the row, earning one point for each card in the row plus one point for each star on cards in that row. Record this score on paper, then return these cards to the display.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player scores 30, 35, or 40 points, with this total being dependent on the number of players: 2, 3, or 4.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Overview&#10;&#10;Masters of the Gridiron combines the simplicity and strategy of a 15-minute head-to-head card game with the depth and detail of a pro football simulation. Years of development have yielded a realistic football simulation that combines simple and elegant rules with unlimited depth and strategy. By focusing on one key play in each scoring drive, you play an entire football game in under 15 minutes. Every player, from your star quarterback to your under-appreciated right tackle, has their own player card; and each player has the ability to impact the result of every game.&#10;&#10;Masters of the Gridiron can be played by anyone; even those who are new to the game of football. Intuitive rules mixed with tense competition gives this game an addictive edge you won't find in any other sports game.&#10;&#10;History&#10;&#10;Clay Dreslough, the game's lead designer, wrote his first dice-based sports simulation in 1976. He later discovered similar games from companies like Strat-O-Matic and Sports Illustrated, but he didn't enjoy them very much. It's tedious to spend several hours picking plays, flipping them over, rolling dice, looking up the results on a chart, rolling more dice, moving counters on the &quot;play clock&quot; and so on, just to resolve each play.&#10;&#10;Instead, Clay created the award-winning Baseball Mogul and Football Mogul computer games, capable of simulating entire seasons in just a few minutes. We used this technology as the under-pinnings for Masters of the Gridiron -- to create realistic player ratings for over 680 current players, and to create realistic playbooks for all 32 teams.&#10;&#10;Over the last four years, we have boiled down 26 pages of rules to the bare essentials, creating a head-to-head card game that feels like football.&#10;&#10;Setup&#10;&#10;You choose your starting offensive and defensive players, and combine them with a playbook of 24 (or more) cards. You can pair an MVP quarterback with 3 superstar receivers, or focus on your offensive line and the running game. Choose a standard 4-3 defense, or add a nickel back to help stop a team built around the passing game.&#10;&#10;Masters of the Gridiron encourages you to create your own customized deck, combining your favorite players and plays from multiple decks. Three simple rules govern the creation of your own customized team roster and playbook. This gives your freedom to build your offense around a power running game or a vertical passing game, and tailor your defense to pressure opposing quarterbacks or focus on forcing turnovers (to name just a few examples). Assemble an offensive juggernaut and try it out against your friend's shutdown defense -- the possibilities are limitless!&#10;&#10;Game Play&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with 3 offensive player cards, 3 defensive player cards, and 4 playbook cards. To mount a scoring drive, you match a playbook card to an offensive player with the appropriate skills (such as &quot;passing&quot; or &quot;run blocking&quot;) and lay them down on the table, announcing the player rating that your opponent needs to beat in order to stop your attempt to score. Their ability to stop you depends on a combination of their strategy decisions and the luck of the draw.&#10;&#10;Players alternate possessions until &quot;time runs out&quot; (when each team has no more offensive player cards to draw). Along the way, you enjoy all the aspects of a real football game, from goal-line stands and two-point conversions to game-changing interceptions and last-minute field goals.&#10;&#10;The playbook cards themselves are used to track your score. So the only thing you need to play are two decks (one per team) and 15 minutes of time.&#10;&#10;Contents&#10;&#10;Each deck contains 54 high-quality full-color playing cards:&#10;&#10;13 Offensive Player cards&#10;13 Defensive Player cards&#10;24 Offensive Playbook cards&#10;4 Defensive Playbook cards&#10;Each team includes their own printed card box for safekeeping. Our cards are also compatible with other card-storage boxes and sleeves, such as those used for collectible card games like Magic: The Gathering and Pokemon.&#10;&#10;Licensing&#10;&#10;Please note that Masters of the Gridiron is not licensed by the National Football League.

League games add support staff and let you improve your team over a full season of games.&#10;&#10;The game includes rules for risk-based scoring, penalties, injuries, mascots, cheerleaders, physicians, assistant coaches, mavericks, 50 player skills (like Savagery and Immaculate Reception), 70 strategy cards (like Epic Fail and No Time to Bleed), and more. All of this adds up to enough strategic options to fuel hours and hours of thrilling victories and agonizing defeats.&#10;&#10;",

When evil gets all fancy, they break that biz down...for hope!&#10;&#10;In the Bravest Warriors Co-operative Dice Game, you take on the role of one of the Bravest Warriors or one of their best pals. Working together, you'll try to overcome Events and Encounters seen in Bravest Warriors episodes using your Portals and Special Abilities. Encounters require various symbols to beat them, and those symbols are found on the twelve custom dice, which are divided up between the players as evenly as possible. Each player rolls her own dice, but once rolled the dice are pooled together to use them as best you can as a team. If you don't roll what you need, you can play Portal cards (as seen in the &quot;Sugarbellies&quot; episode of the show) or use your character's Special Abilities. Conversion Portals, Re-Roll Portals, Gift Portals and more can make the difference between success and failure.&#10;&#10;When you fail a challenge, the team suffers a calamity and the Encounter is placed into the Failed! pile. If you fail five Encounters, you lose the game! If you run out of Portal cards, you lose the game! If too many Bravest Warriors get K.O.ed, you lose the game! But if you score enough Victory Points or use up all of the Event cards, your team wins! (The actual number of VPs needed to win depends on whether you're playing easy mode (for younger or new players) or standard mode.)&#10;&#10;",

The movement track zigs and zags around five walls on the game board, with a starting space at the beginning of the track and two goal spaces at the end; land on a goal space by exact count, and that pawn exits the game, moving you closer to victory.&#10;&#10;On a turn, roll two dice, then choose one of your pawns and move it a number of spaces equal to one die, then a number of spaces equal to the other. You can choose to move forward or backward on the track &mdash; or in both directions if you wish, with each die moving you in a different direction. The walls have the digits 1-6 on them, and if your pawn is next to a number that you rolled and you haven't used that die for movement, you can hop the pawn over that wall. Roll just right, and you can jump twice.&#10;&#10;If you move in a single direction and your second move lands you on an opponent's pawn, you bump that pawn back to the starting area. If you move in both directions or hop over walls, you can possibly bump two opponents in the same turn.&#10;&#10;",

The side deck cards can be used to modify the player's current total, i.e. adding 1, subtracting 3, etc. The side deck is built by each player before the game, but at the beginning of the game, only the top 4 cards become the player's hand.&#10;&#10;Each player takes turns, which includes drawing a card from the draw pile, adding that to the other cards already drawn/played by the player, then the player may either play a card from their hand, end turn, or stand (not taking and not playing anymore cards).&#10;&#10;Each round ends with each player either standing or when a player ends his turn with a total over 20 (similar to busting in blackjack).&#10;&#10;The person closest to 20 without going over wins the round. In the case of a tie, neither player wins. After one player wins 3 times, the game is over.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In the late 19th Century the land of Transylvania fell under a terrible curse allowing Vampires, Werewolves, and Zombies to terrorize the citizens.  The Governor issued a desperate plea for help.  You play one of the best and bravest Adventurers in the world called to Transylvania to break the curse.  Your goal is to find the Knowledge to break the curse over Transylvania but beware, the Knowledge you seek may just turn you into one of the terrible Monsters you have come to destroy.&#10;&#10;Transylvania: Curses &amp; Traitors is a heavily themed adventure and exploration game utilizing a modular board, variable player powers, hand management, and dice rolling.&#10;&#10;Paths to victory include:  1. Solving the curse of Transylvania by finding the right combination of Knowledge cards and returning your pawn to the Church Tile.  2.  Becoming a Monster (vampire, werewolf, or zombie) by collecting Transformation cards and then killing half the other players.  3. Killing a Monster as an Adventurer.&#10;&#10;Game play:  The board consists of sixteen 6&quot; x 6&quot; tiles representing places in Transylvania such as the Church, Graveyard, and Castle.  Adventurers start on the Church Tile and explore uncovering new tiles.  Each tile contains token spaces which are opportunities to perform challenges of strength, mental acuity, and spiritual fortitude.  A successful challenge results in the reward of a Quest card.  The Quest deck contains the Knowledge cards needed to break the curse.  While exploring Adventurers will also encounter Events.  Failure of Events leads to injury and/or death while success leads to additional rewards.  If Adventurers collect Transformation cards plus a card that activates the Transformation card, they become a Vampire, Werewolf, or Zombie.  The goal of the game immediately changes from seeking Knowledge to eliminating the other players by attacking them.&#10;&#10;",

Deal an equal number of remaining cards out to each player (12 cards/4p, 16 cards/3p) for their initial hand. The player who sings the best rendition of the alphabet song is the first Start Player.&#10;&#10;There are two phases to each game round - Play and Pass.&#10;&#10;1. Play: All players simultaneously lay face down in front of them one card from their hand. Cards in front of a player are not turned face up unless cards played during the game state otherwise. Players may look at their own face down cards at any time. Once all players have placed a card, each player beginning with the Start Player, may, in turn, use the &lsquo;reveal&rsquo; action of one card. When players each have 2 cards left in their hand they will play one card and discard the other and the game will end.&#10;&#10;2. Pass: All players then pass the rest of their hand clockwise or counterclockwise depending on the Start Player&rsquo;s choice. The player to the Start Player&rsquo;s left is the next round&rsquo;s Start Player.&#10;&#10;Some cards allow you to keep a card(s) or your whole hand. Those cards always supercede the Pass rules. Players may never take an eL, aheM, NO! or Peeking card from another player.&#10;&#10;Once all cards have been played, all players turn over all remaining face down cards, add up victory points and adjust scores with bonus modifiers. The player with highest score is the winner. In the case of a tie the player with the most bees is the winner.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

It is your task to explore the houses and steal as much as you can, avoiding the detection of the Diamyo and his loyal servants.&#10;&#10;Using a fast-paced simultaneous card play, players compete to steal the most ryo (gold pieces) and other valuables from the Diamyo's property.

How many and all is determined by the specific card.&#10;&#10;Combat is resolved by comparing combat strengths of the units and drawing cards from that same deck. Whenever a joker is drawn, the turn is over, the deck is reshuffled and a new turn begins.&#10;&#10;The Coalition player wins if they are the last to control the Leipzeg hex, otherwise the French win.&#10;&#10;",

The goal of the game remains the same: Create valuable combinations shown on the scoring sheet and collect more points than everyone else to win.&#10;&#10;The deck consists of 108 cards, with the numbers 1-6 each appearing 18 times. Each player starts with a hand of five cards. On a turn, a player has two choices:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Discard 0-5 cards from your hand, then draw that many cards plus one from the deck. You can't have more than ten cards in hand.&#10;     Play five cards from hand, record your points on the score sheet, then refill your hand to five cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;In more detail, to score, you lay down five cards and score for one of the combinations on the score sheet: number of 1s, 2s, etc.; three- or four-of-a-kind; full house; small or large straight; Kniffel; etc. Write the score in the left-hand box of the appropriate line. You also lose 2 points for each other card in your hand, so note these penalty points in the right-hand box.&#10;&#10;As soon as one player scores in all of the lines on his score sheet, players complete the round so that everyone has the same number of turns, then they tally their scores and subtract their penalties. Whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

Down with Narwhals!&#10;&#10;Beluga Cup is a Decktet game inspired by Balloon Cup and game play is quite similar. Players are attempting to capture &quot;fish&quot; in each of 6 different colors (associated with Decktet suits). These cubes are placed into each of the 4 regions throughout the game and the player who has the highest sum of cards when a region is full will gain the chips. If you have bad cards do not fear! You may play them onto either side of a region thus undercutting your opponent's own play.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game each different suit will be scored separately. The player who holds a majority in each will gain points equal to the number of cubes that their opponent has in that same suit. Thus the goal is to have the smallest majority possible in as many suits as possible in order to maximize the points gained.&#10;&#10;",

Each player shuffles and then draws 5 cards from their 10 card deck. Everyone takes turn playing wager cards (which include some cheats and other sneaky stuff), until they are out of cards. Everyone's deck is the same, but the cards they drew could be very different. Finally the boxes and wager cards are flipped face up.

Starting from the very edge of the mountain, you &ndash; a mage on a mission &ndash; must use your powers not only to make your way to the centre, but also to impede and slow down your opponents through myriads of magical trickery - rotating their mazes into dead ends, burning their caverns, or even outright destroying what they create - all in order to ensure that the only wizard making it to the centre is you and you alone. But beware, not only do you have to make it to the centre, you have to make it out again.&#10;&#10;With up to 3 other mages trying to stop you, that may not be such an easy feat!&#10;&#10;The rules for Mazemaster are simple. At the beginning of every turn, players select up to three action cards they wish to use once the turn begins. These could be anything from as simple as move and build to cards that allow a player to rotate other player&rsquo;s maze tiles, teleport them across unbridgeable gaps or even to destroy their path altogether. Each player, when selecting the actions they are going to take, can&rsquo;t just think about what they plan to do; they also have to remember to try and slow down any player that may be ahead of them, or even preparing for a dastardly piece of magical trickery coming their way from an opponent, even as they try to make their way to the centre of the map, wherein lies the relic.&#10;&#10;Reaching the relic, however, isn&rsquo;t the end; your wizard has his powerful new weapon, but he needs to get out of the mountain in order to understand how to use it! And chances are, if you reached it first, your fellow players may not be too keen on letting you escape so easily!&#10;&#10;",

Aces have a value of one.&#10;&#10;SET UP: shuffle the cards then lay them face up in a circle or square to form the track. Then one player decides to be Odd, the other Even. Both take three tokens. Odd places one token on the odd numbered cards of the same number, either all the aces, threes or fives. Even does the same, just on even numbered cards (twos, fours, or sixes).&#10;&#10;MOVEMENT: The number value of a card determines how far a token is moved. Who moves which token doesn't matter, only that the Odd player moves an odd number of spaces, and Even an even number, both moving in a clockwise manner. Occupied cards in the path of your token are hopped over and not counted when moving, only one token can occupy a card at any time.&#10;&#10;SCORING: at the end of your turn, count how many spaces you moved in total, including occupied cards you skipped over. An odd number scores points for Odd, an even number for Even, regardless of who moved the token. For example, if Odd moves a token on a 5 card, but is forced to hop over an occupied space in the way, this equals six spaces moved, so Even receives six points, though it was not his or her turn. The round ends when someone has gained 30 points, the winner receiving the difference between the winning and losing scores. For example, if Odd has 30 and Even 28, Odd gets 2 points for that round.&#10;&#10;GOAL: to gain 30 points after a series of rounds. The loser of a previous round starts the next one. Tokens are not rearranged between rounds, and both players start the round with zero points.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Livestock Uprising is a tactical resource management game in which you harvest farmland, marshal animal armies, and battle for control of the farm. Each player takes control of one of the four animal factions: pigs, goats, cows, or chickens. Each faction has its own barn and special attributes that impact gameplay.&#10;&#10;Each faction has three Generals that move around the farm harvesting crops and marshaling troops. Initially, the Generals can harvest only the least valuable resource: grass. Players must spend their resources in order to marshal new troops, which unlock the ability to harvest better resources, e.g., a donkey allows its General to harvest corn. Players work their way toward harvesting the most scarce resources so they can marshal the most powerful troops. Each General can command only five Troops, so players often specialize the Generals based on their location, nearby threats, and distance from their barn.&#10;&#10;The farm is an 8x8 randomly tiled board containing crops, obstacles, and empty fields. When setting up the board, a small 4x4 grid is laid out randomly, and each player positions his barn anywhere along the perimeter of the grid. The rest of tiles are then randomly laid down to form the final 8x8 board. When choosing a starting location, players must consider the available resources, distance to neighbors, and the faction's special abilities.&#10;&#10;In addition to the common Troops, each faction may also marshal Special Forces. Each Special Force Troop gives the faction a distinct advantage: chickens gain a movement bonus, cows gain a defensive bonus, pigs gain a harvesting bonus, and goats gain an attacking bonus. Players also have three hidden Command Cards that they may play at any time to gain an advantage or get out of a tough situation. The Command Cards range in effects and are very valuable when used appropriately.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to destroy the other factions and take control of the farm. Players achieve this by forming a Super Army and triggering the end game. At any time a player may choose to form a Super Army if all of their General are in their barn. The Super Army combines all of the player&rsquo;s Troops together under a single General. This massive army gets an attack, defense, and movement bonus, but cannot harvest resources or marshal Troops. Forming a Super Army triggers the end game as the only effective strategy against a Super Army is to form one of your own. The Super Armies then drop the gloves and battle it out for all or nothing victory.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Theme: The time is in a distant future. Humanity has become part of a Galactic Council of a precarious nature, wrought with nefarious alien races all watching the other with incredulity and disdain. The Council has adjourned from a meeting that has left the members&hellip;&hellip;at odds, to say the least. Having already been dispatched, you take the role of commander of a small strike force representing your race and its enthralling stake in an archaic space station orbiting Earth. Equipped with unique and outlandish weaponry, abilities of extraordinary and marvelous effect, and the luck of the die, you will battle other players and the perils on board the station in a race to complete your missions and grasp victory.&#10;&#10;Game-Play: In Xenofaction, you control one of the many playable alien races with 3 four man squads at your disposal. Each with unique weaponry, abilities and styles of play. The board is made  of a hex grid making movement very easy and fluid. Weapons ranging is also based on this hex grid, for example; if a weapon has a range of 4, you count 4 hexs in the direction you are shooting from the attacking unit to the defending unit. The flow of game play if fluent and smooth as each unit completes its actions before you move to the next. Players take turns moving their units aboard the station and taking actions when necessary or desired. What stands out about Xenofaction is in between each players turn, another player will get the chance to control the station units (generally NPC's in a computer game). So instead of a computer autonomously controlling the actions of these type of units, players will get the chance to act as a sort of pseudo A.I. Action cards are used to create unique events and spur of the moment tactics, as well as useful items and bonuses to units.&#10;&#10;Goal: The way to win in Xenofaction is to simply gain enough victory points. These points are gained by accomplishing numerous tasks. First there are universal missions you can try to complete that are active for every player. Each mission can only be completed by each player once, but another player completing a mission does not make it unavailable for others. Next is sometimes even more fun and necessary than the missions. Each unit you kill or destroy, except your own, gives you victory points, each being worth a designated amount. One thing to keep in mind, sometimes the station wins.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The creators of numerous successful Kickstarters, including Four Tribes and Dig Down Dwarf, bring you a new blind bidding and deck-building dungeon delving card game. Of Dungeons Deep! is a fusion of many mechanics and was inspired by such games as Smash Up!, Dungeon Raiders, Cutthroat Caverns, and Friday and is set in an amazingly illustrated world that is whimsical, with just a touch of darkness. Of Dungeons Deep! takes a brave new look at a classic theme, is easy to learn, and employs simultaneous play which equates to almost zero downtime for players!&#10;&#10;We are proud to announce that ALL the artwork for Of Dungeons Deep! has been commissioned by the fabulous Derek Bacon. Mr. Bacon has worked on such titles as Tower, Baldrick's Tomb, and Smash Monster Rampage. His style is both playful and edgy, and we feel it is the perfect match for the game. Plus his name is BACON so.....&#10;&#10;Bluffing and Blind Bidding. Players are attempting to destroy the nasty creatures below in the dungeon to gain fame by playing cards face down and revealing simultaneously. Each enemy has a set number of hit points based on the number of players. There are three enemies to deal with in each level of the dungeon, so strategy, tactics, and bluffing are a must. There is also two rounds of bidding so players gain insight into what other players are up to.&#10;&#10;Deck Building. When a player defeats an enemy, that card is rotated 180 degrees and then added to the player's discard pile. The bottom of each monster card indicates what item the enemy is carrying. These items add power to your character in future rounds, and act as an organic and thematic way to show that your characters are advancing.&#10;&#10;Draft Your Unique Party. Before play begins, players complete a draft in order to create their starting hand of twelve cards. Each player gets one Hero and one Henchman. All characters are very unique and play quite differently from one another. This sets the bar high for replay value!&#10;&#10;No Down Time! Since all play is done simultaneously, no players are ever waiting on others for very long. This makes Of Dungeons Deep! one of the fastest dungeon delvers out there.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Pick-a-Seal features the same gameplay as Pick-a-Polar Bear, but without the two variants of that game. An individual game supports 2-5 players, while combined the two games support up to eight players.&#10;&#10;To set up the game, lay out 30 cards in a grid (49 cards with 6-8 players) and give one card face down to each player. Each card has five attributes, with each attribute having two states: large/small, with/without a raised arm, orange autumn/blue winter background, with/without goggles, and with/without canned fish. Someone shouts &quot;Go!&quot;, then everyone looks at their card in hand. Players then start grabbing cards from the grid and stacking them in hand. The card grabbed must be identical to the top card in hand or differ from that top card in only one way. Thus, as you grab cards, the attributes of that top card will keep changing, forcing you to look for matches in new ways.&#10;&#10;Once a player thinks he can't grab any more cards, he yells &quot;Stop!&quot; The round ends, and all players check their card stacks. If someone made a mistake when grabbing cards, that player keeps none of the cards gathered that round. If the player who stopped the round made no mistakes, he earns an extra card. If, however, he stopped the round when he could have collected more cards, then he loses all the cards he's collected during this round.&#10;&#10;To set up for the next round, give each player a new face-down card and fill in the holes in the grid. When the deck runs out, complete that round, after which the game ends. Whoever has collected the most cards wins!&#10;&#10;Components&#10;96 cards (3 sets of 32 different cards)&#10;1 rules sheet&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The American Civil War was a bloody conflict that took place 150 years ago between 1861 and 1865. After the war ended many Confederates said that the South would rise again. Now with the help of Wallet Battles their dream can come true.&#10;&#10;Wallet Battles essentially takes an old Civil War coin flipping game and combines it with the new micro board game concept to create a fun interactive game that can be enjoyed over and over wherever you go.&#10;&#10;Game Overview: &#10;Wallet Battles is a micro board game for two that is played on a plastic card that has battle maps available on both sides of the card. Players flip coins to earn the right to perform actions that will help them battle for ownership of various locations on the map. The key objective is to have the most points by the end of the game. To achieve this objective you need to control as much of the map as possible and build stacks of coins to strengthen your defenses.&#10;&#10;Setup: &#10;Place the map you wish to use face up between both players. Now divide equally between both players a handful of coins. We recommend 6 quarters, 6 nickels, 6 dimes and 6 pennies for optimal play, however, any amount of coins can be used to manipulate the length of play.&#10;&#10;Decide who wants to represent the Confederates (Tails) and who wants to represent the Union (Heads).  If needed, a regular coin flip can be used to decide for you.&#10;&#10;Play: &#10;Each turn begins with both players flipping a coin onto a table. Each flip has three potential outcomes:&#10;Heads: Both coins show heads.&#10;Tails: Both coins show tails.&#10;Odd: One head and one tail is shown.&#10;&#10;If the coins land on Heads the player representing the Union can place one of his coins on the map or if his opponent already has coins on the map he may capture one of his coins to place in his pile for later placement.&#10;&#10;If the coins land on Tails the player representing the Confederacy can place one of his coins on the map or if his opponent already has coins on the map he may capture one of his coins to place in his pile for later placement.&#10;&#10;If the coins land Odd the coin flip must be repeated. No other action is required, however, if Odd is flipped three times in a row all players must remove a coin from the map and return it back to their pile.&#10;&#10;To strengthen your defenses you must build stacks of coins. Smaller coins must go on top of larger coins. Therefore, if your base coin is a dime you won&rsquo;t be able to build a stack. You can&rsquo;t build on your opponents stack, however, you can capture coins from him.&#10; Game End:&#10;The game ends when all coins have been captured, your opponent is out of coins  or when all possible locations on the map have been used. Players earn 2 points for every location they control and 1 point for every coin located on the map. Stacks of coins consisting of three or more coins will be doubled in value. Any coins not used will be counted as 1 point. The player with the most points is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;",

It features a simple ship to ship combat system and five ship classes for balanced deep space fleets. Players build their ships, engage in commerce, and confront their enemies with one goal in mind: total domination of the galaxy.&#10;&#10;The game board consists of a representation of the galaxy on a hex grid. Every dot on the board is a star system, with the stars grouped in a spiral having six arms. Some of the star systems are connected by warp lanes. The warp lanes have the effect of bridging distant star systems and speeding travel across the galaxy. On the edges of the galaxy are the home systems, which are the bases from which the players start their conquest.&#10;&#10;Players will develop and defend commercial empires, and force concessions from enemies by deploying powerful warships and fleets.

        "description": "German Solo is a German 8-card plain-trick game for four individual players using a 32-card deck (7-A in each suit). It is essentially a simplification of Quadrille, itself a four-player adaptation of Ombre. As in Quadrille, players bid for the privilege of declaring trumps and deciding whether to play alone or with a partner.&#10;&#10;Each player receives 8 cards dealt in 3-2-3, with two dealt to the  blind (received by the winning bidder). Aces rank high and tens rank low. The queen of clubs or spadille is always the highest trump, and the queen of spades or baste is always the third highest trump. Both do not count as members of their natural suits. The trump seven or manille is elevated to the rank of second highest trump. Below that the cards rank normally, except for omitting the queen if it is black. Thus depending on whether the trump suit is black or red, it contains 10 or 9 cards. Black plain suits contain 7 cards, and red plain suits contain 8 cards.&#10;&#10;Bidding and scoring are complicated and not uniform. Bidding begins with the player to the left of the dealer. To bid, a player declares &quot;I can play&quot; (at least a 5 bid). The next bidder to bid either passes or declares &quot;I can play too&quot; (at least 5 clubs or 6). Once all but one player has passed, that player can declare a suit and call for an ace of another suit to be partner or decide to play &quot;solo&quot;.&#10;&#10;Scoring can be point based or played using dimes and nickels. The bidding and scoring hierarchy is as follows.&#10;&#10;5 hearts, diamonds, or spades - 5 cents&#10;5 clubs (called &quot;better&quot; when bidding) - 10 cents&#10;6-8 bids increase the bid by 5 cents per level&#10;solo bids outrank regular bids andearn more money because everyone pays the bidder (in partner games, both the bidder and the partner get paid on winning or pay out on loosing).&#10;&#10;Trick-play is as in Whist. Player to the left of the dealer leads to the first trick. Players must follow suit if possible; if not they can play anything. Whoever played the highest trump, or the highest card of the suit led, wins the trick and leads to the next trick.&#10;&#10;Bidder's, i.e. declarer as a soloist or together with his or her partner, must win the number of tricks bid. If bidder's party wins all tricks to the number bid, they can stop the game and get a bonus for prime. If they continue playing at that point they cannot score prime, but may be able to score slam for winning all tricks (bonus 5 cents).&#10;&#10;",

The players start in their own camp and try to get their chips into the opponent's camp. Chips which are flicked beyond the board are eliminated from the game, same as chips which are hit by opponent chips. Some areas of the board and some chips have special meanings which are explained in the game rules.&#10;&#10;The game is over when one team can't move any chips. The team with the most points (for reaching the opponent's camp, crossing the river and chips left on the board) wins the game.&#10;&#10;This game is an early Swiss merchandizing product of the 1940s.&#10;&#10;",

Anyone can join the fun, but only one will be crowned the Champion. Do you have what it takes?&#10;&#10;Rules&#10;Randomly, arbitrarily, or by the selection of cards (longest word or phrase) one person is selected as the Card God.&#10;The Card God selects three subject cards and rolls the Die of Decision.&#10;&#10;The remaining players &ndash; the Card Champions - will have 5 min to incorporate the subjects of the three cards in a story of the style dictated by the Die of Decision. The words must be used implicitly. If a selected card reads &lsquo;a pod of whales&rsquo; then the story must use the exact phrase &lsquo;a pod of whales&rsquo;. The only modifications allowed are pluralization and possessive modifiers. If a verb is in gerund form or presented in a certain tense then they must be maintained.&#10;&#10;When the five minutes elapse, each champion will present his or her story before the Card God and the other champions. When all stories have been read the Card God selects the victors of the round. The winners receive a number cards as dictated by the Card God, though the cards cannot be distributed evenly. Victory cards may be distributed 3-0 or 2-1. 1-1-1 is not allowed.&#10;&#10;This is not a competition for the weak.&#10;&#10;If the Card God so chooses he may award a Crown of Laurels to a truly exceptional literary achievement. A Crown of Laurels is worth 5 subject cards.&#10;&#10;Once all cards have been awarded the title of Card God moves to the person to the left of the current Card God and the game continues.&#10;The Card Champion who obtains the most cards and laurels by the end of the game, as chosen by the participants or when one champion is awarded 5 Crowns of Laurels, wins and is crowned Champion of Champions.&#10;&#10;",

But do not think it will be easy, because usually Burocrazy does not help its citizens: the offices only operate during certain hours, there are endless queues, and forms and signatures expire quickly, forcing you to restart the process the next day! Good luck and lots of patience will be needed to not go crazy in the process!&#10;&#10;Bureaucrazy is a worker placement game, with an approximate duration of 45 minutes. Holds 2 to 5 players. A match lasts 5 turns, in which players try to get the highest possible amount of money in order to be the winner at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;",

He says what object fits into the sequence, then uses the pirate ship on the edge of the box to shoot marbles into the trays on one edge of the playing area. If he lands a marble in the tray below the correct missing item, as verified by the answer on the back of the card, he gets to draw a treasure tile. He can then stop or continue to draw treasure tiles &mdash; but if he draws a treasure of the same color as one he already drew that turn, he must return all of them to the play area and gain nothing that turn.&#10;&#10;Once all the treasure tiles have been claimed, players compare stacks of tiles to see who wins. Die Logik-Piraten includes two sea monster figures, and players can choose to add one or both to the playing area to make it more difficult for pirates to shoot their cannonballs.&#10;&#10;",

They shuffle the track-half of the tiles, then lay them out. Players take turns trying to match tracks to animals, advancing the time-tracker whenever they're wrong. If they match all the animals before night falls, they win.&#10;&#10;In the second game, players use the harder side of the paired tiles, but otherwise gameplay is the same.&#10;&#10;In the third game, players use both the animal and tree tiles, laying out one half of these pairs. Players take turns revealing one tile from the other halves, and every other player race to find the match, claiming the tile when doing so.&#10;&#10;",

In Fu&szlig;ball-Fieber, each player chooses a team and tries to lead it through the group stage of the World Cup.

This promises exciting duels that never turn out the same way.&#10;&#10;Each player chooses one of the 32 teams from the 2014 World Cup, and leads it through the group phase of the World Cup. With the help of action/reaction cards, each player can try to control the result of his own matches, and also cause trouble for the other players.&#10;&#10;And for those players who manage to qualify, a knock-out phase with quarter-finals, semi-finals and the great final awaits them.&#10;&#10;Players have to manage a hand of cards to maximize their result over the 3 group matches. Each card can be played on any team: his own, his opponent, but also any team from the other matches. For the knock-out phase, players get a new hand for those 3 new matches.&#10;&#10;The winner ? There can be only one: the last team standing, winner of the final and WORLD CHAMPION.&#10;&#10;",

The board is an ordinary 8x8 black and white chessboard, but extended along each of four sides for the player's starting fields.  Along each 8-square side of the board is another six squares, then another four squares, then two, all of them centered.  The overall shape of the board then can be seen as a square with jagged edges, and with its four corners highlighted in colors to match the players' pieces.  The colored squares are the starting positions for each player.&#10;&#10;The game's rules of movement, capture, and winning conditions appear to be otherwise the same as in Chess.&#10;&#10;",

As cards can be played either face up and face down, jumping out in time is crucial. The last player gets everything that's left, which normally is good but can be devastating.&#10;&#10;",

The coalition forces (Russian-Austrian-Prussian) must quickly seize the capital weakly defended to end the rule of Napoleon who stayed too long behind.&#10;&#10;The game features two scenarios: the first scenario corresponds to the historical situation that saw low numbers of troops under Marmont and Mortier standing  for honor, facing an enemy five times bigger and inflicting the highest losses of the campaign. The second scenario is hypothetical but historically plausible. If Napoleon had from March 2nd decided to follow the Allies to Paris and defeat them rather than trying to harass their supply lines.&#10;&#10;",

The blockade tiles are shuffled face down and ships are put into their holders, set up and placed at a minimum of one box length distance from the board.&#10;&#10;In your turn you first turn over one blockade tile; the number on the tile determines the number of ships participating in the current blockade. One of your fellow players places this number of ships on spots of the board, in any orientation and position he likes; one of the ships must always be the Droid Control Ship. Then you as the active player take the five star chips and try to topple all ships by throwing chips at them, with a maximum of five throws. If you manage to topple all with less than five throws your turn ends with the last toppled ship. If you toppled the Droid Control Ship you score two points and you score one point for each other ship you toppled; one extra point is scored for each star chip you have left over. You move your Jedi Sternj&auml;ger forward accordingly along the box edge. If your Sternj&auml;ger reaches a score of 20 you win at the end of this round if you have most points. In a variant you must topple the Droid Ship with a certain kind of chip and score penalty points for ships you did not topple; in another version there are no given spots for the ships, you can put them anywhere.&#10;&#10;",

Players use the towers to sink tiles (i.e., remove them from the board). As more tiles sink, players can slide the remaining tiles through the resulting empty spaces.&#10;&#10;A player wins when all the remaining tiles of that player's shape are connected, or when the remaining tiles of that player's color are connected. A player can also win by sinking four tiles while the opponent sinks none.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "(From the game's Consimworld folder)&#10;&#10;The Battle of Ap Bac was the first large-scale fight waged between the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) and the National Liberation Front (NLF). Up until this point in the Vietnam &ldquo;Conflict&rdquo; the NLF, soon to become known as the Viet Cong in the US, had waged a war of insurgency in South Vietnam. On January 2nd, 1963 the 7th ARVN infantry division dispatched elements of its 11th Regiment to support two Civil Guard battalions to take out a radio transmitter the NLF were operating in the hamlet of Ap Bac. This time, however, the Viet Cong chose to stand and fight. As the day wore on and the fighting escalated the ARVN were compelled to send in armor and airborne forces, as well as committing air support in a fight that decidedly went against them. It was the first stand-up fight for both sides&rsquo; forces, and one that did not bode well for those of South Vietnam. Perhaps you can do as well or better?&#10;&#10;Players use a standard deck of playing cards to activate their units and resolve combats. Play is very interactive, easy to learn and competitive. Although designed for two players, What Went Wrong can easily be played solitaire.&#10;&#10;",

Do you have what it takes to ensure the health and safety of your patients who have needs that can change from minute to minute?&#10;&#10;Acute Care is a co-operative board game in which players take on the role of nurses staffing a busy medical/surgical unit in a hospital setting. Through one 12-hour shift, they must work together to provide care for their patients and deal with emergencies and complications as they arise &mdash; ideally achieving a high level of quality while doing so.&#10;&#10;The most precious and limited resource for real-life nurses is their time, so in Acute Care time &mdash; in the form of &quot;time cubes&quot; &mdash; is exactly what you must spend in order to complete tasks and care for patients. Each hour, you have six times cubes (each representing ten minutes of real time) to allocate to various tasks; cards that require you to spend time cubes have little boxes on which to place the cubes to indicate that you're performing that action.&#10;&#10;Since the players are all working together, the Challenge Deck provides the opposition to the players throughout the game. Each card drawn from it represents some challenge or opportunity that the nurses must face in order to care for their patients and manage the unit.&#10;&#10;Gauging success in a healthcare setting can be difficult. Having patients get better and discharging them home are the main goals, but the quality of care provided is also important, regardless of the outcome. Quality care includes patient satisfaction, staff cooperation, timeliness, performance improvement, and effective patient and family education, so in Acute Care, success is measured on a scale of quality points earned or lost, eventually leading to either Commendations (for high quality) or Deficiencies (for low quality).&#10;&#10;",

Players use these cards to build melds following a color pattern that forces the melds to be grammatically correct Japanese sentences.&#10;&#10;The game has solo, collaborative, and competitive modes to allow for play and learning in both individual and social situations.  The game play in competitive mode allows for building and improving one's melds to gain points that enable the player to eliminate opponents' melds.&#10;&#10;The educational focus of the game is to practice sentence-building in a fun environment.  This practice has the side-effect of exposing players to the vocabulary on the cards as well as training the mind to create proper Japanese sentences with any Japanese words they learn or already know.&#10;&#10;",

The players quickly look for this particular pig, then race to snatch the piece of soap lying in the direction that this pig is looking. If this particular pig isn't visible, they must instead snatch the &quot;jam jar&quot; in the middle of the square. If the first player who grabs something grabs the correct item, he turns the pig so that it looks toward him; if the pig was already looking in his direction, he instead takes the pig tile.

What's more, the artist can't talk, each other player can make only a single guess, and each type of building material can be used only once during your turn. A correct guess rewards both the guesser and the artist, with the players gaining points on a score track. Whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

Since all cards show their color on the back, the players have more information than usual. In addition to cards in hand, the game includes a common supply of cards, some of which can be added to the tricks to make it easier to reach a player's goal. This strategy might backfire, however, if cards of the wrong color make it into a trick and you're aiming for a low score in that color.&#10;&#10;During each trick, you must follow suit, even with the special trump cards. This also makes it difficult to correctly predict which tricks you'll get. In the end, the player who comes closest to his predictions wins.&#10;&#10;",

Unfortunately each tile could have your cowboys on them, or other players' cowboys - or cowboys from all players! Once an area is fully surrounded by fences you score that area.

If you can't move, your opponent moves again immediately, moving the tower matching the color of the space occupied by the stymied tower.&#10;&#10;",

But you might have a rough idea, and that&lsquo;s good enough because Terra is the party game where being close counts. And if you have absolutely no idea what the answer is? Take advantage of your friends who do know!&#10;&#10;Terra is a redesign of Friedemann&rsquo;s 2009 SDJ-nominated FAUNA, which had similar mechanics, but was specific to animals. Terra changes the subject matter to general geographic information, includes a brand new Imperial measurements map side (retaining the Metric map side for gamers outside the U.S.), has 300 topics (with three categories of questions) on oversized cards, and simplifies the scoring. Terra plays in 45 minutes for 2-6 players.&#10;&#10;(End of publisher's description.)&#10;&#10;Terra is a trivia game with cards that ask three related questions, such as &quot;where was the Woodstock music festival?&quot;, &quot;what year did it take place?&quot; and &quot;how many people attended it?&quot;  A card is selected, and players take turns guessing the answers to the questions by putting tokens on the board in different areas, such as on a map of the world, a time line, or a number line indicating the number of people (as in the example).  Points are scored for correct answers, but some points are also scored for close answers.  Whoever has the most points after a predetermined number of rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Every sequence must conform to one of the two rules:&#10;&#10;First rule:&#10;If the sequence has 3 or more numbers, every number is the sum of the previous two numbers - but we only use the last digit of the sum. For example, if the previous two numbers are 6 and 7 then since 6 + 7 = 13 the next number must be 3 (we ignore the first digit, &quot;1&quot;). Other valid Yushino sequences are 875, since 8 + 7 =(1)5; 7291, as 7 + 2 = 9 and 2 + 9 = (1)1, etc.&#10;&#10;Second rule:&#10;If the sequence has 2 numbers, the numbers must differ by 1 - but keep in mind that the numbers repeat, so we go from 0 to 9 and then back to 0 again, which means that 9 is next to 8 but it is also next to 0. Examples of valid two-number sequences are: 56, 87, 90, 09, 98, etc.&#10;&#10;",

In this asymmetric strategy game, one player plays as the invasive virus while the other player plays as the defending immune system.&#10;&#10;Players alternate turns moving pieces across a hexagon grid. When pieces collide, they cancel each other out and are both removed from the board in an even exchange. The virus has the added ability of multiplying (adding additional pieces to the board) and the immune system is able to place &ldquo;immunoboosters&rdquo; which destroy any piece they fall on and change the playable area of the board.&#10;&#10;The goal of the virus is to complete the infection by getting a single point to a certain point on the opposite end of the board. Blue wins if it effectively eliminates the virus from the board or permanently blocks the virus from reaching its goal point.&#10;&#10;",

Just sit there like a picture of innocence kn owing you've gambled too much of the bank's money and hope that nobody has the nerve to challenge you.&#10;&#10;Fourth in the Really Nasty games series, after Horse Racing, Golf and Motor Racing. Inspired by the financial crash of recent years. Straightforward rules and doesn't require any previous knowledge of banking.&#10;&#10;The Monopoly-style board game casts players as the chief executives of fictitious banks with names like FullerCrookes and the RippOrf Banking Group. The aim is to invest the bank's cash as recklessly as possible without getting caught, and take home the biggest bonus. And, as a tribute to the financial crash of 2008 where Lloyds TSB and RBS were bailed out by taxpayers, players also have recourse to a 'public bailout' card. If a market collapses while they are heavily invested in it, the player is allowed to keep all their money.&#10;&#10;",

A kind of spinner is used to determine how many pieces a player may use in a given turn, zero through four.  The game can be played with two to ten players, each with thirty-six pieces of his own color, whether playing individually or in partnership.&#10;&#10;For every turn, a player spins, then places that many of his pieces on the board, with the goal of surrounding an opponent&rsquo;s pieces completely.  This is called an &ldquo;entourer&rdquo; and the surrounding player must then remove all of his opponent&rsquo;s pieces and replace them with his own.  If an entourer is caused by more than one player, they then take turns removing and replacing their opponent&rsquo;s captured pieces.&#10;&#10;At any time during the game, players may barter with each other to regain their lost pieces.  The first player to have all of his pieces on the board wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Bug racers have come to compete from all over the world, and the first one to cross the finish line will become globally famous. Moreover, the winner will gain interplanetary fame as for the first time in the Grand Bug Races, robobugs from the space station will participate in the next stage of the competition.&#10;&#10;Bug Race is an easy to master but still captivates as a dynamic board game race for 2-4 players  from 8 years old. Each player leads his own bug to victory moving its legs one after another. Of course, legs shouldn&rsquo;t be torn off the body or tangle with each other. When a bug passes all 9 levels of the playing field and crosses the finish line first, its owner wins the game.&#10;&#10;Each bug consists of 7 elements, body and 6 legs, and runs at its own track, divided into sections. There are special notches for the bug&rsquo;s legs, gashed on the each side of the track. Body, that covers three sections, is placed at the track between the legs. &ldquo;Losing&rdquo; legs is permitted: each leg should touch the body at least diagonally all the time. So the bug can not stretch for more than 5 sections.&#10;&#10;When the game begins, players place their bugs at the start positions &ndash; the three first sections of the track. Tracks cross at the middle of the table and connected by the central element with the race aim on it. They are not bonded hard so players don&rsquo;t pull others&rsquo; tracks while moving their own bugs. If needed, in case of lack of free space on the table for example, playing is possible without a center element. And of cause you don&rsquo;t need extra tracks if there are less than 4 players.&#10;&#10;Moving bugs is performed by using special cards. Each of them allows to move 2 or 3 legs, a front left and a middle right, for example. In the beginning of each round players draw two of such cards from the stack. One of them stays at the hand and another one goes to the next player. Then both cards in the hand should be played in any order. Player moves all the stated legs forward if there is a free notch and the leg won&rsquo;t be torn off the body. It&rsquo;s possible to move the bug&rsquo;s body forward as well at any time during the turn if it won&rsquo;t cause a leg loss.&#10;&#10;When everyone finish playing cards &ndash; by verbal understanding cards can be played all at the same time or by turns &ndash; players discard them and draw the new ones. The game is over when at least one bug has passed the finish line by its body, which should be located at the three last track sections. If such a bug is the only one, its owner wins the game. If there are several challengers, the winner is defined by the location of legs.&#10;&#10;Skillful players can play 4 cards instead of 2 during the turn. In that case each player draws 4 cards from the stack, leaves one in the hand and gives three to the next player, chooses one from the derived cards and gives two, and at last gives one and keeps another. By the way, players can choose the convenient design: there is a forest glade with an apple at the one side and a space station with a big red button at the other. Bugs are also two-sided, well-matched to the game field. Of cause, nothing impedes robot-bugs to land on the Earth as well as common insects can visit a space station, it will be even more interesting.&#10;&#10;",

This is a war type fighting game utilizing cards and dice. Unique game mechanics, multiple target options, independent enemies and allies and battlefield teleportation makes AD an amazing card game experience to be enjoyed by hard core card gamers as well as the casual gamer alike.&#10;&#10;Champion abilities are totally unique to the powers they have.  What does that mean? Take for example the blood champion, her power and power beasts cards will have different effects from those of different champions.  She has combo type power cards where as the water champion has evolution type power cards.  Another example is the fire champion having preload damage type power cards(Preload is a type of card where you use currency to determine the time or damage a card will perform before its played) where as the imagination champion will be very location specific.  All that to say, skilled play will be vital to winning, not just having the best cards.&#10;&#10;Awaken Destruction will give you all the tools you need to build a great deck to start and you compete to make them stronger. There are no additional packs to buy after the initial purchase unless a champion update comes out. Your starter deck will have the maximum number of each card your champion can have and then you can tailor it down to your style of game play. There is no random card pack selling going on in AD. If a champion update is released, you will know every single card in that update before you buy it.  We feel this method allows players to spend more time playing and less time spending.&#10;&#10;You haven't played a card game like this before. I never played TCGs prior to designing AD. When I created this, I had no idea what was already out on the market or what had come before me.  I created a game I felt would be very fun to play,  a skill based game that rewards a players abilitiy to think and adapt changing strategies as they play.  You are not out of this game just because you are down at the moment.  Cards and luck can change in an instant. Its kind of an emotional rollercoaster at times.  Ive been down and out for what I thought was a no win senario and the independant enemies came in and rocked the other player and gave me that little window of hope that I was able to use to finish the match.  On the other hand, I been in games where I thought I had it in the bag and and I few heals from killing bonuses and the other player was right back in the game, so you never really know how it's gonna turn out.  Which is why having the ability to adapt different play styles mid-game is going to be what seperates the good players from the great ones.      &#10;&#10;&#10;",

Not an ambush, as is popularly thought, the battle was actually a meeting engagement. The French in Fort Duquesne, told by scouts that a large British force with guns was approaching, sent elements of the Duquesne garrison on a preemptive strike. The French force met the British vanguard column before they could set up an ambush.&#10;&#10;Braddock&rsquo;s Defeat is a two player game with each player taking the side of either the French or the British. Both players have allies to control: the British side American colonial and Indian units, the French side Canadian militia and Indian units.&#10;&#10;Braddock&rsquo;s Defeat also is highly suitable for solitaire play.&#10;&#10;This game was issued as a separate game as a gift to Gold donors for the 2014 Consimworld Donation Drive.&#10;&#10;",

After each move, a player places a new spider into the web (any position, but a different grid that has intersections with the one for the dice). Once all ten spiders have been placed, these can be after a die's movement. Spiders move any distance along the web, unless they are blocked by other spiders.&#10;&#10;Every time a die crosses the web, it is turned up one number (starting with a one). If a die with a five on it reaches the starting position again, it is turned to a six and the owner wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

Players make up family trees during the game learning russian history and lifestyles of different generations. Family Tree inculcates interest to country&rsquo;s past and own family history in a game form and develops improvisation and counting skills.&#10;&#10;How much do we know about our ancestors? Where were they from? What job did they have and what were they fond of? How did they find their partners in life? We rarely think of it in our childhood but it&rsquo;s getting harder to find the answers by each year passing by. That&rsquo;s why it is so important to rouse up children&rsquo;s interest in family history as early as possible. Understanding of generation continuity and forefathers&rsquo; connection with historical events is just necessary for the child to grow up as an all-sufficient and self-contained person.&#10;&#10;Each player is telling a story of a common Russian family, constructing its genealogy table. The game is based on the character cards with people of different generations on them, born in pre-revolutionary times at the first half of the 20th century towards to people of nowadays. Each character has a name, a profession, a date of birth and a portrait designed in a family picture album style &ndash; all these traits combine into a whole appearance of a typical representative of his age and social group, like a soviet scientist or a present-day manager, for example.&#10;&#10;Single characters don&rsquo;t form a tree yet &ndash; they should be bound with family relationships. Married couples, children and parents need to be matched by age. It can be calculated in mind but birth dates are added to the cards for more convenience. After all, firstly, husbands and wives should meet each other: play a meeting card and tell a short acquaintance story. Also there are some event cards which can be played at the character, suitable by age &ndash; passing through the Great Patriotic war, attendance at Yuri Gagarin&rsquo;s first space flight start, election to State Duma (Russian Lower chamber). In such a way a personal family history binds with the global history of the country.&#10;&#10;There are two varieties of game rules: &ldquo;The big family tree&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dynasties&rdquo;. The first one better goes with big companies up to 10 players and is suitable for the first play. In this case players construct one big tree, and the one who will be the first in playing all cards from the hand wins the game.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Dynasties&rdquo; is a basic and mostly profound game mode comfortable up to 4 players. Each player makes up his own family tree or several at time which can be united during the game. Families of different players can become related with each other. Overall number of relatives, antiquity of the exact family name and participation in historical events influences the victory.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Two thousand years ago on the borders of the Roman Empire, life goes on as might be expected &mdash; but barbarians lurk across the border, so not only must the players grow grain in the fields, catch fish, and chop wood, but they must also maintain watchmen in a clever network of watchtowers to keep a lookout for fires and barbarian attacks.&#10;&#10;Limes is based on the designer's board game Cities, and while the game system is roughly the same, the scoring is completely different. In addition, the tiles in Limes have a different layout from those in Cities. Together, these changes ensure that Limes has become an entirely new game. (Limes includes two sets of cards, one for each player, but if you combine copies of the game, any number of people can play at the same time.)&#10;&#10;Each player has his own deck of cards. One player shuffles his deck, then places a card at random on the table; each other player takes this same card and places it on the table in his own area. Each player can optionally place one of his figures on this card; once a figure is placed on a card, it cannot be returned to the supply. The second card played (and all subsequent cards) much be placed adjacent to or touching the corner of an already-played card. After each card placement, a player can either place a new figure on this card or move an already-placed figure; a figure can move from one territory to an adjacent territory, e.g., from woods to lake or from grain fields to woods.&#10;&#10;The game ends as soon as any player has placed 16 cards in a square (4x4 grid). Each player then receives points as follows:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Farmers receive one point for each connected grain field.&#10;    Fishermen receive one point for every house situated directly adjacent to their lake.&#10;    Watchmen receive one point for every patch of woods they can see in a straight line (north, east, south, west) from their tower; other watchtowers block their view, so they can't see woods behind those towers.&#10;    Woodcutters receive one point for every territory to which they can deliver wood, e.g., every different adjacent territory.&#10;&#10;&#10;The player with the most points wins, with ties being broken in favor of the player who has the highest score with a single figure.&#10;&#10;",

Should an animal be added to the pile while it's already the top card, players race to strike the table while woofing, baaing or otherwise making the sound of the animal depicted. Should the top two cards sum to 7, however, players must strike the table and &quot;Oink!&quot; at the same time. While the numbers on most animals range from 0-6, the pig has special rules, with a 7 on each card; thus, whenever a pig is placed on the pile, everyone must race to slap and oink as quickly as possible! Whenever a player correctly slaps the pile, she places the cards aside in a score pile; if incorrect, she must add a card from her deck to the discard pile (or scratch her head while making monkey noises, as the players prefer).&#10;&#10;When all players run out of cards &mdash; or when at least one player is out and someone has claimed the pile &mdash; the game ends.

One side of the game board &mdash; titled &quot;Grenzstreitigkeiten&quot;, or &quot;Border Disputes&quot;, and made for 3-5 players &mdash; includes house sites that straddle two regions; to claim one of these locations, a player must discard two appropriately-colored cards. The number of emissaries in a region is limited to the number of houses of the same color in that same region.&#10;&#10;When all house spaces in a region are filled (or at the end of the game), players score for that region. Whoever has the most houses in that region scores one point for each house in the region, whoever has the secondmost houses scores one point for each house of the player who has the most, and so on.&#10;&#10;At game end, players also score for having majorities of emissaries in two adjacent regions, scoring as many points as the number of emissaries in both regions. Players also score for having four or more houses in an uninterrupted sequence along one of the roads on the board. On the &quot;Grenzstreitigkeiten&quot; game board, players also score majority points for the houses in the port cities located in multiple regions, these port cities effectively forming their own region. Whoever scores the most points wins.&#10;&#10;&quot;Grenzstreitigkeiten&quot; has one variant. Each player starts with one fortification in addition to his other pieces. Once per game, a player can play two matching cards, then place his fortification on a house site, then top it with a house. Whenever this house scores &mdash; whether for the region majority, for being a port city, or for being part of a sequence &mdash; the house's owner scores double the points he normally would.&#10;&#10;The other side of the game board &mdash; &quot;Wege der Diplomatie&quot;, or &quot;Ways of Diplomacy&quot;, which is made for 2-4 players &mdash; also has a variant, with each player receiving a marketplace. Once per game, a player can play two matching cards, then place the marketplace on a house site, then top it with an emissary (not a house). This allows a player to compete for emissary points in a region that is otherwise full.&#10;&#10;",

There are three sizes of game piece; each player has two statesmen (large,) four politicians (medium,) and six voters (small,) for a total of twelve, referred to as that player's phalanx.&#10;&#10;The game begins with players taking turns placing any one of their pieces on any one station.  Like Mill, when a player is able to line up three of his pieces in a row, he is then entitled to remove one of his opponent's pieces, but in the case of this game, only voters may be removed in this fashion.  Unlike Mill, pieces in Politics may jump and capture each other as in Checkers, in any direction, once the initial placement phase is concluded.  A piece may only jump a like-sized or smaller piece.  To win, one must reduce the opponent to only two pieces, or to immobilize his remaining pieces.&#10;&#10;",

You are a witch of the classic green skinned, pointy hatted variety, in competition with your weird sisters for that iconic status symbol: loads of warts!&#10;&#10;Each card is an ingredient, and the cards interact based on their colors. As you add them to your cauldron, they have various effects, and when you have all four colors present, your potion goes POOF! If you had the right stuff in there, when the fumes clear out you'll be wartier than ever. All your sisters will be jealous.&#10;&#10;But that's not all. In the heap of entrails and goop lie some of those most dreaded ingredients: healthy vegetables! Toss them into your opponents' cauldrons to spoil what would otherwise have been an absolutely disgusting brew, or, if you've got just the right color balance, you can use them to set your potion off with only minimal side effects!&#10;&#10;Gameplay is three rounds. Each player gets 1 poof per round and may play 1 card per turn unless a card allows otherwise. When a player has poofed, their cauldron is reheating and is closed until the next round, so they may only play cards into other players' cauldrons until then. Cards may add or remove cards from cauldrons, cause players to draw or discard cards, give or take away warts, and plenty more specific gameplay-manipulating effects.&#10;&#10;Number of players for one deck can be 2-6, although larger numbers of players can be supported by simply mixing in an additional deck.&#10;&#10;",

Upon arriving at a restaurant, the player selects a card, scratches, sniffs, and announces to the table what he suspects the food to be.  The player then opens the card, revealing it only to himself.  If correct, he keeps it and earns a point toward winning the game.  If incorrect, he closes his eyes and the player to his left swaps it with a card from another restaurant.  Play rotates and continues until all of the cards have been correctly identified.  Whoever has identified the most foods wins!&#10;&#10;",

The hexes are alternately colored red, white, and blue, except for the central hex, which is colored gold.  Each player (one with black pieces, one with white) has eight pawns, four knights, two cannons, and one king.  Each piece is capable of capturing enemy pieces, and has a different method of movement.  The king piece cannot be captured, but can be put into check as in Chess.  A player's king must be moved to the central gold hex to win the game.&#10;&#10;According to one account, the game's inventor lived in New Zealand.  The exact method for each piece's movement is currently unknown, though there is some mention of the cannon pieces moving somehow laterally.&#10;&#10;This game is not to be confused with another Jaques game called Hexagony, which used hexes in a much different and smaller configuration, and with different pieces.&#10;&#10;",

Two players, black and white, have pieces in three types: four captains, three commodores, and one admiral.  To start the game, the board is positioned with the extreme corners of the board closest to each player.  The admiral piece begins on the hex closest to each player.  The next two hexes closer to the middle of the board remain empty.  On the following three closer hexes are stationed the three commodores, and on the next four hexes the captains.&#10;&#10;Pieces are not captured at any point in the game. Admirals may be moved one space at a time to any adjacent hexagon. Commodores are color-bound and may move two spaces to a hex of the same color.  The intermediate space need not be unoccupied, only the hex on which the commodore will land.  Captains are moved any number of spaces in a straight line from the joining sides of their hex, but may not pass over another piece.  To win the game, an opponent&rsquo;s admiral must be blockaded from being able to move in any direction.  Movement may be prevented by either player&rsquo;s pieces, and once an admiral is blockaded, none of that player&rsquo;s other pieces are allowed to move.&#10;&#10;",

(You can remove the cobra cube itself, but it's worth zero points. With no other options, though, you might have to remove it!)&#10;&#10;As cubes come out, others slide down toward the base. When only a single layer of cubes remains in the plastic tray, the game ends. Remove all the cobra cubes on the bottom level, along with any cubes that share a face with cobras. Whoever has the most ankhs in each color now claims any cubes of this color from the tray. (In a tie, no one claims these cubes.) Players then tally their points, and whoever has the high score wins.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Once upon a time, the world needed heroes.  Brave souls seeking fortune and glory in the name of all that's good.  Eventually, they gained whatever it was they sought and have retired.  Too bad evil didn't do the same.  Thus quests and monsters grew in number until, finally, Percival Thistlewood invented 2 foot tall wooden golems which, when clothed, took on the role of whatever garmets they wore. Initially designed for utility, the popularity of these Dungeoneering Dolls quickly spread throughout the kingdom and now you are one of many collectors attempting to create the best collection of Dungeoneering Dolls.&#10;&#10;As a simple card game, Dungeoneering Dolls has two types of cards.  The first is the quests, which occur at the end of the game, but the most cards are actually the Dolls. Dolls come in six classes and each class contains dolls numbered 1-8.  These dolls are all worth a set number of positive or negative points.  When you play them, you will stack like classed dolls on top of other like classed dolls.  So any new Ranger goes on top of a previous Ranger, if applicable.  There are also eight Limited Edition Dolls which may be played at any time and act as &quot;rule breakers.&quot;&#10;&#10;When someone plays a card, there is a chance for another player to steal it.  To do this, they need to play a card of the superior class in an equal or higher level.  So Berserkers beat Thieves beat Rangers beat Wizards beat Knights beat Clerics beat Berserkers.  If a card is used to steal a card, they discard the card used and instead, claim the card they are stealing for their collection.&#10;&#10;The game continues this way until the first quest is revealed in the draw pile.  Then players resolve each quest one by one until the game is over.  Quests will make demands like having the strongest Ranger.  You'll discard the Doll which fulfills the quest to claim it and in the end, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Each hand takes 9-12 minutes to play and a longer game may be desired, in which case, play to a set number of points.  Percival Thistlewood's Incredible Dungeoneering Dolls was initially released on The Game Crafter in both Poker Sized and Tarot Sized card formats. It became a part of The Game Crafter's Village in a Box Kickstarter as one of the Microgames.&#10;&#10;",

There are two built-in flaps on either side that can cover up one row each, making the board 8x8, or can be opened up, resulting in an 8x10 board.  Two lines through the board divide it into four quadrants.&#10;&#10;Two players each have a variety of pieces in their own color.  For the basic 8x8 game, starting positions are very similar to Chess, but with differently named pieces, including Workers, Merchants/Banking, Labor/Transportation, Agriculture/Manufacturing, Capital, and Government.  Government is essentially the King piece, and to win the game, the opponent's Government piece must be &ldquo;cornered,&rdquo; that is, prevented from moving.  The movements and capturing for the game's pieces however do not correspond exactly to those of Chess, and in some cases are governed by the four quadrants of the board.  In the 8x10 game, extra Workers are placed on either side in the additional rows, as well as new Government Commission/Corporation pieces.&#10;&#10;The game was meant to be manufactured with a cover that would rest on the flaps and the board's outer rim and seal it up with pieces inside for easy storage.&#10;&#10;",

If you reveal your strategy too early, someone could pre-empt it; however, if you wait too long you might miss your chance. You can add secret bonuses to your characters to raise the stakes or sabotage your opponents' characters with lousy weapons.  You can mess with your opponents' lines to give yourself the best advantage. At the end of the round, the player with the most points wins. Surviving characters are placed in the back of the line and a new battle begins. The player with the last character standing wins!&#10;&#10;",

Each ingredient takes a certain amount of time to prepare and player order is rearranged each round to reflect time taken, so players must time their actions just right to make sure they get the ingredients they most want.&#10;&#10;To build a pie, players splay filling cards on top of crusts cards, and even toppings on top of the fillings. Players have to decide when they want to box/score a pie as is or try to compete for a majority in scored cards with Influencers(the Higher-ups).&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, a combination of boxed pies and  influencer icons will win the game!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Fields of Despair: France 1914-1918 is a 2-player hex-based strategic level block war game set on the Western Front of the First World War. Players take control of the Allies or Central Powers fighting the war on land, at sea, and in the air all the while making tough economic and technological decisions at home.&#10;&#10;Fields of Despair has a unique block system designed to maintain the fog of war throughout the entire game. In most games, block combat values range from one to four. In Fields of Despair the range is zero to twenty.&#10;&#10;The range in values makes Fields of Despair a very deceptive game. Players can build up a large force with a single block instead of giving away their strategy with a stack of blocks.&#10;&#10;Movement is simple and free flowing. Players are allowed to &ldquo;make change&rdquo; during the movement phase. Thus a block with a combat value of 16 could be broken in two blocks of 8 before moving, or conversely two blocks could be combined into one. Zero-value blocks known as &ldquo;Deception&rdquo; blocks could also be part of the exchange. Thus after every movement phase you never really know the strength of your enemy.&#10;&#10;The fog of war isn&rsquo;t lost after first contact with the enemy. Blocks remain hidden even when enemies occupy the same hex and stay hidden until one player decides to allocate an air squadron for reconnaissance or sends his men across no man&rsquo;s land.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;1 Mounted Board 22&quot; x 34&quot;&#10;1 Rule Book&#10;1 Playbook of Scenarios and Examples of Play&#10;2 Player Boards (to track Econ and Tech)&#10;&#10;140 Blocks and Stickers&#10;- 48 Black&#10;- 49 Light Blue&#10;- 30 Tan&#10;- 10 Olive&#10;- 3 Orange&#10;&#10;240 Counters&#10;- 162 5/8&rdquo; Counters (+14 blanks)&#10;- 18 1/2&quot; Counters&#10;- 60 1&rdquo; Counters (Air, Artillery, Tanks)&#10;&#10;74 1/4&rdquo; wood cubes (Economic Points)&#10;- 30 Blue (Allied Naval/Production)&#10;- 30 Black (CP Naval/Production)&#10;- 12 Red (Eastern Front)&#10;- 2 White (Naval, no effect)&#10;&#10;2 Bags for drawing Naval War and Eastern Front chits/cubes&#10;&#10;Various Player Aids (Solo &amp; 2-Player)&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Action-Mat Football is a tabletop dexterity game themed after American Football. Players advance the ball along the playing surface (a 30 x 65 inch mat representing a football field) by flicking it with their fingers, thus causing it to slide on the playing surface. Each flick of the ball represents a play.&#10;&#10;Prior to executing each play the offensive player chooses which type of play to use and determines where on the field he will place the individual members of his team. Simultaneously the defensive player places his individual team members on the field, in an attempt to guess the offensive play. After the defensive player has placed his tokens the offensive player then places his tokens according to the play previously chosen.&#10;&#10;As in real football, the offensive player has four general options on each play: passing, running, punting or attempting a field goal.&#10;&#10;In order for a pass play to be successful the offensive player must flick the ball, causing it to slide along the playing surface, ultimately contacting one of his own tokens. The player tokens consist of flat cardstock and when the ball token slides over top of them they tend to slide along with the ball token. When the ball stops sliding, if there is only an offensive player's token still caught underneath it, the play resulted in a pass completion. If there are one or more player tokens from each team, the pass was incomplete. If one or more tokens from the defensive team remain under the ball token, with no tokens from the offensive team, the pass was intercepted.&#10;&#10;Running plays are not executed by sliding the ball. Instead both players secretly deploy their individual player tokens to any of the multiple eligible running lanes on the field. If the offensive player deployed his ball carrier to a running lane that was left unguarded by the defensive player, then he simply rolls three dice with the result being the number of yards gained on the play. If the lane is guarded by a defensive player, then both players roll a single die, and the yards gained (or lost) is determined by subtracting the defender's result from the offensive player's result.&#10;&#10;Punting is performed by sliding the ball token down the field. If the ball slides into the endzone the receiving player can choose to start their drive at the 20-yard line, or attempt to return the punt by rolling dice to determine yardage.&#10;&#10;Field goals are made by finger-flicking the ball token into the air and through a set of plastic uprights.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Ships deals with the history of shipping, from the time of the Phoenicians to the modern era. The game is divided into three ages, marked with different ship types. The first age is that of the galley, followed by the age of the galleon, then finally the steamship age. The board combines a track showing the development of ships, similar to that in Automobile, with a map of Europe and an area representing the rest of the world.&#10;&#10;Your turn is divided into two phases. In the first phase, you choose to either conduct commerce (such as selling goods, taxing locations or improving your warehouse) or take a card, selecting one from seven on display; the cards vary in their effects, granting money, victory points or special actions.&#10;&#10;In the second phase, you choose whether to place a ship, move a ship, or retrieve ships/merchants. When you place a ship, you do so in either the merchant box or the warship box in one of eleven levels. A merchant allows you to place a merchant cube on the board, giving you one or two goods counters to place in your warehouse. A warship lets you take control of a location at the cost of one food goods counter.&#10;&#10;Once all of your ships are on the board, you can either move them (paying money to advance its level and take the associated action) or retrieve it from the board so that you can place it elsewhere later. As ships are placed in a level, the cost of placing in the next level reduces &mdash; until finally somebody is willing to pay the cost to place in that level (which earns bonus points and possible additional income). When a ship is placed in the first galleon level, galleys become redundant; similarly, someone placing in the first steamship level makes galleons redundant. During the galleon and steamship ages, you can pay extra to move more ships, so having money in hand gives you a greater range of options and allows you to use your fleet more efficiently.&#10;&#10;When placing ships, you can initially place only in &quot;1&quot; locations, which are grouped around the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Once someone pays to move to a &quot;2&quot; location, which are grouped around the western Mediterranean, that area opens to others, with the other areas being Northern Europe (3), the Americas (4), East Indies (5) and the Pacific (6). As soon as a new area opens, players score points for merchants and control discs in the present area, with the points earned being the same as the number of the area.&#10;&#10;Ships includes six types of goods: food, oil, metal, wine, cloth and spices. Each has a monetary value as well as a special power. Food can be used to take control of locations, thus building an empire. Oil can be used to gain extra actions. Metal helps to advance your ships along the outer track. Wine can be converted to goods of a lower value. Cloth can be converted to victory points, while spices have the highest monetary value. You have to decide whether to cash your goods in for money or use their power.&#10;&#10;NOTE: this description is out-of-date.&#10;&#10;",

Each turn the top card will be flipped (starting with the Entrance) and players will face the specific encounter on the card.

Other &quot;Special&quot; encounters might allow such actions as players to sell their letter cards for gold.&#10;&#10;The player with the most gold at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Machinas: Death Races in the Wasteland is a post apocalypse racing game that  features a unique set of mechanics where the players are involved at all times. Unlike other race games where players can drift far to the rear and out of the action, Machinas uses a &quot;pack&quot; mechanic where players are always in the action. Instead of tracking your position on the track we track your position in the &quot;pack&quot;.&#10;&#10;Machinas is our first card driven game that can be played by itself or added to any existing miniatures or RPG. Machinas is a stand alone game that can be used with any Post Apocalyptic rules, such as our own After the Horsemen.&#10;&#10;All you need to play Machinas comes in one deck of cards and the rules. No track is needed and all you need to know to play the game is on the cards! You will have to provide a couple of everyday six-sided dice, but that's it.&#10;&#10;Players customize their drivers and cars then race around the track. If you want you can race along highways and roadways in your favorite post apocalyptic setting, it's up to you.&#10;&#10;Each driver has three Attributes - Savvy, Tech, and Speed and there's a wide variety of ways to customize your car. When the race starts each player keeps his cards out of sight until needed. Once played the cards are laid out for all to see. This keeps the customization of your car a secret until it is revealed.&#10;&#10;But customizing your car and driver is just the beginning.&#10;&#10;During the race you have to plan your strategy and tactics. When do you sit back and when do you make your move? Do you try and shoot up your opponents or make dramatic two car passes? Machinas is much more than rolling dice and the drivers with the the right strategy and good tactics will win.&#10;&#10;Machinas is a perfect one-off pickup game, easy to learn and fun to play. For the serious gamers you can choose to play the Campaign Game where your cars and drivers get better as you gain experience.&#10;&#10;",

Having no children of his own issue, any claim to his rather sizable fortune must issue from his legal will.  Unfortunately the Baron not only wrote many different wills in the last years of his life, it seems he tore them all to shreds.  The six known claimants have been given twelve hours to prove their rights to inherit.  As one of these claimants, you must search the Baron&rsquo;s country manor to find fragments of the will which name you as heir.&#10;&#10;Would that it were only that simple.&#10;&#10;The other potential heirs are collecting their claims as well, and there&rsquo;s nothing to stop them from picking up your fragments to keep you from having them.  Some might even stoop so low as to steal claims you&rsquo;ve already gathered!  Keep in mind that opportunities also exist for collaboration, however, and that a winning strategy often includes working with your opponents when the time is right.&#10;&#10;As if the competing heirs weren&rsquo;t enough to complicate your efforts, the End itself is an ode to the many peculiarities of the Redmayne family.  An ancient structure, expanded and updated haphazardly many times over the centuries, even the oldest members of the staff know only a portion of its secrets.  These individuals are key to your success, providing invaluable aid not merely in collecting your claims but also in successfully traversing the dangers of the house which may at times seem an implacable opponent.  For as you race from room to room, the house itself will interfere with your movement.&#10;&#10;Grisleigh End is also a tribute to the mystery fiction and the authors who have entertained generations of readers.  The artwork references hundreds of golden age mystery novels and short stories, from The Abbey Grange by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to The Zero Clue by Rex Stout, and dozens of mystery authors represented, from Margery Allingham to Israel Zangwill.&#10;&#10;",

And where is the witch?!&#10;&#10;In Gruselrunde zur Geisterstunde, players first construct the villa, placing the walls in the box, then sliding cardboard characters on their cardboard &quot;wands&quot; through some of the ten slots. This villa then has a light placed inside it before a roof is added. Each round, a player is challenged to place two characters into the center of the villa. This player moves two of the wands so that the characters inside the villa are pushed forward; she then peeks through a peephole to see whether she's correct, and if so, she gains a scoring token after other players get to verify the characters. After a player collects her third token, finish the round so that everyone has the same number of turns. Whoever has three tokens wins!&#10;&#10;Gruselrunde zur Geisterstunde includes a variant in which each round the active player is challenged to place three characters in the center of the villa (instead of two), and opponents guess whether or not this player was correct. After the active player pushes in the character wands, each opponent secretly places either a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; token in hand, then they reveal them simultaneously. If the active player was right, she gains two scoring tokens while each opponent who guessed &quot;yes&quot; earns one; if she's wrong, then each opponent who guessed &quot;no&quot; earns one token. The winning threshold in this variant is 8-10 tokens, depending on the number of players.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The Game of War, in the designer's own words:&#10;&#10;&quot;THE GAME OF WAR is one of skill, and belongs to that class which includes chess and checkers. It is played upon a board laid out in squares or rectangles, and the pieces employed represent and symbolize the important men and weapons of warfare, while their movements simulate the military evolutions of two armies opposed in battle, advancing, retreating and engaging in the diverse methods that characterize actual warfare, and employing all the various forms of strategy.&#10;&#10;Each side, as a fighting force, comprises a king, a commanding officer, field and siege artillery, cavalry and ordinary troops and flying machines.&#10;&#10;All the movements of Chess are found in the game, and, in addition, the troops have the movements made familiar in checkers or draughts, while some pieces are given different moves, and more freedom of movement than in either Chess or Checkers. But while these two games are thus drawn on to contribute all their virtues, the vital principle of The Game of War is radically different and wholly new.&#10;&#10;In Chess the game is won when a player so hems in his adversary's king that it cannot escape capture; in Checkers all of the adversary's pieces must be captured and taken from the board, or the last of them penned, to secure a victory.&#10;&#10;In The Game of War, however, the object is to lay siege to and capture the citadel &mdash; a central square in the king's rank on which the ruler is stationed at the outset of the game. When an adversary's piece can enter and hold this square without being captured at the next move, such occupancy of the citadel wins the game.&#10;&#10;Chief of the many other distinctive features in The Game of War is the introduction of two flying machines on each side. The purpose and the movements of these are wholly novel, and give a singular fascination to the playing of the game. Moreover, the board used in the game is of a new design, having one hundred squares, instead of sixty-four, as in chess and checkers, and the all-important citadel square stands forth in battlemented prominence. In addition, there are four flying machine stations.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Command a Greek city's hoplite soldiers. Push and rout enemy lines. Coordinate allied attacks to secure victory, but watch your flanks!&#10;&#10;Nika, inspired by ancient Greek geography &amp; warfare, is based around two core mechanisms: facing and formations. Pieces can be routed off the board if attacked from the side or back, but not from the front. A routed piece can rally back onto the board at the cost of an action. Your pieces can move or rotate together in a phalanx if they are adjacent and facing the same way, and you can push back enemies facing you if your phalanx is deeper than theirs.&#10;&#10;There are four cities: Athens (white) and Messene (blue) are allied against Sparta (red) and Thebes (black). Allies start across the board from each other, and you win by getting a piece into your victory area in the heart of your ally's territory. Each two-city alliance can be played either solo or with a partner, so the game can support two, three, or four players.&#10;&#10;Every player has enemies on both sides, making the distribution of both pieces and actions between fronts a strategic and often tactical consideration. Maneuvering, timing, coordination, and sacrifice are all key elements of strategy.&#10;&#10;Says designer Josh Raab, &quot;Nika is the ancient Greek word for 'conquer'. The concept of Nika came to me in a dream while I was studying abroad in Athens. The rules were honed across nearly two years of testing. The board shape and core mechanics were inspired by ancient Greek geography and warfare. Greece has many narrow valleys and mountain passes, and sometimes the only way to defeat an enemy force was to collide with them head-on and literally push them off the field. This othismos ('shoving') is thought to have been the critical phase of most battles between hoplite armies, who were the heavy infantry that dominated ancient Greek war for four centuries.&quot;&#10;&#10;",

Each round, a player reads a question listed on the card as well as the three possible answers. He secretly selects one of them, then the other players simultaneous try to guess it, betting 1-2 chips on their guess. If they answer correctly, they double their bet; otherwise they lose the chips. When the bank runs out of chips, the game ends and whoever has the most chips wins.&#10;&#10;A sequel to ego and a standalone game, ego&sup2; contains 480 new questions.&#10;&#10;",

All you need is a personal planet, several billions of faithful yet simple-minded minions (preferably small-sized and green-skinned) and a dozen of cunning plans. Or two dozens for your own piece of mind. Who are your archrivals? No superheroes I assure you as they are just mythic figures from graphic novels. So, you should beware your competitors, other villains who are eager to add the prefix super to their proud title.&#10;&#10;Today becoming the Supervillain is even simpler than ever! A new boardgame by Right Games and Anton Lozovskiy provides you with everything you need for this fascinating activity. But for opponents &mdash; I assume every self-respecting villain must have some.&#10;&#10;Become Supervillain is a boardgame for two&mdash;five players aged 12+. While competing for the title of the principal anti-hero, players spend their minions to complete secret projects, spin vicious intrigues and shatter opponents' plans with meteorites. You must be first to collect secret projects valued 5,000 points to win the game. Besides, the game can end earlier if all plan cards have been drawn. Then a player with overall maximum points becomes the Supervillain.&#10;&#10;There're two types of cards: plans (they are also secret projects and meteorites) and intrigues (they are also minions). Before the game starts, cards are shuffled into two separate decks and each player draws two intrigues. At turn's start, the active player draws a card from each deck, puts the intrigue in his/her hand and decides what to do with the plan card either by playing it face-up as a plan or face-down as a meteorite. To complete plans you need minions: as soon as the total value of minions on one of your plans become equal or exceed its cost, it becomes the secret project and yields victory points. Often it also gives you special abilities. If you don't want to handle some plan, you may turn it into a meteorite and send at somebody as a valuable gift. Then the card is put face-down with the arrow pointing at your victim. The latter has time before your next turn to deal with the flying meteorite (some intrigues allow shooting them down or even redirecting them). If your meteorite has successfully hit the victim, you draw an extra card from the deck and &mdash; the most important &mdash; destroy a minion on any of his/her plans.&#10;&#10;Intrigue cards can also be played in two ways. First &mdash; as an intrigue itself, in accordance with its text. Their effects are versatile and cunning as true villain's thoughts: take cards from opponents, charge meteorites, protect yourself, accelerate plans, etc. Second &mdash; as a minion, by placing it on your plan (its value is indicated in the upper part of the card). During your turn you may play only one intrigue and one minion or just keep them for some better time.&#10;&#10;Become Supervillain is a speedy and funny parody boardgame with simple rules and lively gameplay. It learns not only to be cunning and vicious but also to shatter other villains' plans. Finally, if our world has to face the Supervillain, let it be you and not some thorough scoundrel.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "En Prise is a card game of chance and strategy that plays just like chess - for two to four players.  No separate board or pieces are required as the cards themselves represent squares of a growing board that takes shape as the game progresses.  A deck consists of 64 cards.  Each player uses 16 cards, matching the pieces and pawns of a standard chess set. They can choose one of four colours (white, black, red and blue).&#10;&#10;Cards are dealt, face-up, into shuffled 'Battleplans' from which cards are played, in the shuffled order, into a central playing area.  Each card represents a square of a chess board.  A square can be occupied (card face-up) or unoccupied (face-down).  On each turn, a card is either placed as a piece/pawn or empty square; or moved according to traditional chess movement rules &ndash; but they can only move within the board squares already created.  When a card is placed (a new square), it must be connected to an existing square of the board.  When a card moves, it is swapped with the destination card so the growing board is preserved.&#10;&#10;Kings can be placed on any turn where there are at least six empty squares on the board.  If a player chooses to do so, all opponents must use their next turn to place their King.  The aim of En Prise, like chess,  is to checkmate opposing Kings.  When a player is checkmated, their board cards are turned over to become empty squares on their next turn.  The winner is the last remaining player.&#10;&#10;Variations described in the rules include En Prise Casino, En Prise Alliance, En Prise Memory and En Prise Blind.&#10;&#10;",

During that time, we have ended up in many hotel room parties, hanging with tons of different types of people from all walks of geek culture. (Hey, it's not a really great convention if you don't try to drink a Klingon under the table. Protip: you can't drink a Klingon under the table.)&#10;&#10;The idea of Room Party is to take what makes those weird shindigs either awesome or horrifying, and turn it into a hilarious interactive experience for your next soir&eacute;e.&#10;&#10;The goal is simple: Build the most awesome room party at the convention.&#10;&#10;It's fun, easy to play and different every time you do. You can play with 2+ people, the more the merrier. There are different variations for more competitive play, or you can relax and just have a good laugh with your friends as you build your parties and sabotage one another!&#10;&#10;",

Each turn, the players act with one Gang member at a time, then the other player acts with one Gang member and so on. Each character can make two actions per turn, except leaders who have three. These actions include moving, shooting, entering into melee, hiding, or Waiting and Watching, which allows the character to act out of turn sequence if an enemy moves within their line of sight.&#10;&#10;Campaigns are made up of three basic game types: Loot, in which the object is to find and lay claim to Loot (with which to upgrade characters and weapons in between games), Territory games, in which the Gangs fight over specific Objectives, and Grudge matches, in which the sole aim is the elimination of the other team.&#10;&#10;Gear, skills and injuries are persistent throughout campaigns, which are Won by controlling a number of territories on a map, each representing an area in which a battle is fought for control&#10;&#10;",

Governments scrambled to cobble together spaceships to investigate the anomaly, but it vanished as unexpectedly as it had first appeared.&#10;&#10;Years later, the wormhole has returned and this time, we were prepared. Probe data shocked humanity when it revealed that a perfectly habitable planet lay on the other side, awaiting human colonization. A global effort was mounted and finally, the colony ship was ready for its maiden voyage. Built from whatever modular components were available, the ship left on its journey, carrying with it a crew of intrepid explorers, meager supplies and the hopes of planet Earth. Would they survive the expedition and start a new chapter in humanity's history on the mysterious planet?&#10;&#10;Earth's Legacy is a co-operative, legacy, micro card game. Though the base game consists of very few components, the combination of player choice, random elements, and unique, persistent game modifications through an upgrade system, lead to a high level of replayability and expandability. The low complexity nature and minimal components of Earth's Legacy make it the perfect introduction to the legacy game genre that will appeal to gamers and non-gamers alike.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Who's A Clever Dick: The Card Game For Real Smart Alecs!&#10;&#10;This is a card based trivia game - one side has two questions, the other side individual letters (eg C, L, E, etc).  Players take turns drawing a card and asking one of the two questions of the player to their left.  If the player gets the question right, they keep the card, if they don't, the card goes back to the bottom of the deck.  The goal is to spell out &quot;CLEVERDICK&quot; before anyone else.  The only wrinkle is that there are also blank cards in the deck - no questions - and the player drawing one of these cards has to try and bluff the other player by making up a question.  If they pull it off, they keep the card and take one from the player, if not, the bluff-callin' player keeps the blank and take one from the asker.&#10;&#10;Note: &quot;Cleverdick&quot; is actually mild slang in the UK, the equivalent of &quot;smarty pants&quot;, you're not actually calling someone a &quot;dick&quot;!&#10;&#10;",

At the start of a round, one team flips its sand timer, then rolls five colored, twelve-sided letter dice; each color corresponds to a row on a paper tablet, with the red die indicating what the first letter in a word must be, the yellow die indicating the second letter in a separate word must be, and so on. The team members think up words that fit these constraints as quickly as possible, stopping the sand timer once they've finished.&#10;&#10;Following this, a member of the other team looks at the word list, starts the same sand timer in reverse &mdash; thereby giving him as much time as the team took to write down its words &mdash; then tries to get her teammates to guess these five words. Clue-giving is done Taboo-style, and that team scores one point for each word guessed in the time allowed.&#10;&#10;",

One deck is a regular deck of playing cards, and the other deck has from one to 3 numbers on them that range from zero (the Bupkis!) card up to 4 figures. Each number card has the four arithmetic operators (plus, minus, multiply and divide) on the bottom left with some or all of them in a darker font. The darker operators are the ones the player is allowed to use during the hand.&#10;&#10;Each round the players are dealt 10 cards and randomly take a Number Card. The players must use the allowable operators on the Number Card to use all the Playing Cards in their hand to total the number or numbers on their card. The player who goes out receives the total of the cards left in the other player's hand as a score. The score is subtracted from the starting score of 500. The first player to reach 0 points is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

The player who lays out the highest number takes the hand and then moves their pawn one space forward on the game board. Every fifth or so space is marked &quot;Dynasty&quot; and a player landing on this space may select one of the trump tokens to place at the lowest possible space on the &quot;trump track&quot;, in the center of the board. As the suits are added to the track, the order in which suits may trump each other follows. For instance, the first placed (and therefore lowest on the track) suit is jesters. Jesters can trump all cards. The next placed suit (set above jesters on the track) is kings.  Jesters will still trump all cards but kings, kings trump all cards. If a player lands on a &quot;dynasty&quot; spot and all six suits have been set, they may swap two suits. Game ends when one player has traversed the entire board.&#10;&#10;",

There are even unique pirate cards such as the rogue, the gunslinger, and the voodoo lady.&#10;&#10;Carrrds! is flexible. You don't have to use all the cards.

Each player gets one pirate card that only they can see at the start of play and places it face down in front of them.

        "description": "Rightgames LLC and Snowbird studio have released Eador: Masters of the Broken World board game based on &quot;Eador&quot; strategy computer games series. Action takes place in a fantasy world of Eador which is broken into pieces of a past holistic world, surfing across the Astral. Players take roles of the Masters, mighty demigods, trying to subordinate as many Eador shards as possible. They forward armies to conquer new territories, cast spells and perform powerful rituals.&#10;&#10;The board game suits for 2-6 players but it&rsquo;s mostly comfortable to play for at least 4 players. All players get their Master cards at the game start &ndash; such cards exist not only for the atmosphere, they also help to settle some controversies. 12-18 shard cards (amount depends on the number of players) are mixed up to a separate pile and the game is over when this pile flows out. There are always two shard cards on the table, the one for the current round and another for the next &ndash; it helps players to plan their moves concentrating on the shards which are easier to get. Shard conquering is performed by playing action cards; there are more then 100 of them &ndash; armies, spells and rituals. At the game beginning everyone gets 7 action cards to the hand. Usually it&rsquo;s possible to add only one more card during the turn so using them should be careful. Rituals are the cards with especially strong features letting, for example, to take more action cards, take someone else&rsquo;s action or shard cards, to gain more winning points. Player can&rsquo;t fight for the chard during the turn if he performs a ritual but these cards give him further advantage.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the round each player decides if he will fight for the current shard or not. You need to play an army or a spell card to join a battle. The most important feature of the army is its power. Also there are the type of the army on the card (Light, Chaos or neutral), its class (warrior, monster, magician or undead) and nature of the ground (hills, swamps, plains, forests). Armies and some spells stay in the battle to the end of the round, some spells work only for the round they were played at. The result of the battle round is counted when all players interested in the shard have made their moves. The owner of the strongest army gets authority points counters according to his advantage above the second contender. Players can give up from the second turn and leave the battle. In this case they can&rsquo;t play armies or spells anymore for the current battle but still have a chance to win if nobody acquires more authority points. When all players pass the battle ends and the shard goes to the player who gained maximum authority points.&#10;&#10;Each battle has some pieces of subtleties. Firstly, it&rsquo;s impossible to play Light and Chaos armies without a special card. Secondly, all the shards are different: some of them give advantages to defined type or class of armies or restrict using them, others allow to play two armies in a round. Thirdly, all armies fighting for the shard at the &ldquo;native&rdquo; land get extra strength. Attentive player will get a big profit considering all these features. When battle for the last shard is over players count their winning points on their conquered shards and performed rituals. That sum shows the winner.&#10;&#10;The game for two or three players differs &ndash; they get 3 or 2 Master cards and make more actions during the round &ndash; to play a ritual and take part in the battle.&#10;&#10;",

Recyclable material tokens are distributed evenly between the two to four players. They move along the branches on the board. When they land on an appropriate recycling spot in their turn, they can leave a token.  The first player to recycle everything wins.&#10;&#10;The game also comes with a poster and a &quot;Personal Pollution Meter&quot; (printed on the box insert).&#10;&#10;",

Due to resource scarcity and social distemper, governments increasingly require clean production and compliance with social standards from you. Also the customers have become more demanding. That's why you initiate PR campaigns. Do good and most of all, talk about it!&#10;&#10;Each round players invest in project and action cards. About thirty different action cards give you special abilities. Before each round all players bid simultaneously for the turn order. On the world map you can cooperate with adjacent projects of other players or harm them financially.&#10;&#10;It is important to develop in all four project categories because you receive extra points for your weakest one. Moreover, the players with the best reputation in each category receive extra victory points. In PR Campaigns you can secretly decide in which area you want to boost your image.&#10;&#10;Try to predict the moves of your competitors and develop your own strategy to win Green Deal!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Each player gets their own deck, and builds a down pile. Then they deal out four cards face-up next to it. As soon as everyone is ready, someone shouts &quot;GO!&quot; and all the players simultaneously begin starting number piles in the center of the table, and playing on each others number piles.&#10;&#10;The number piles are not removed from the table for the duration of the round, and continue to grow and change very rapidly throughout the game. Players can play a card higher, or lower than whatever number is showing on the top of any given pile, but they do need to be sure to match the color of the pile. Also, players can place a wild card on any pile and announce a number, and a color, and then play a card higher or lower than the number they called, in the new color on that pile.&#10;&#10;The speed and excitement build until someone who has played all of their down pile shouts &quot;Flip Flash!&quot; and everyone must stop. Next, the players gather and sort all of the cards that have been played in the center of the table and sort them, so that each player can count up how many cards they played. The score is figured by taking the number of cards that were played, and subtracting double the number of cards that were still in each players down pile.&#10;&#10;WHAT MAKES FLIP FLASH DIFFERENT:&#10;The ability to play up or down on the number piles, and the wild card twist, speed up the game by making sure that you rarely stay stuck for long! The number piles are never capped off, or removed from play during a round, and players flip through their hand-deck one card at a time. The three suits keeps things interesting, but limits confusion as well.&#10;&#10;Flip Flash is different than Nay-Jay! in the number and design of the cards, and a rule change. Flip Flash includes 4 decks of 60 cards each.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Created in October 2011, Tails and Tactics had been in development for almost two years before being released in July 2013. Creator Pedro &ldquo;Reynard&rdquo; Loustaunau first started with a very serious game concept and quickly found it to be lame. After realizing it needed a sillier tone, he quickly went from &ldquo;a little bit lighthearted&rdquo; to &ldquo;quite a bit silly&rdquo; as he realized Jan&rsquo;s art would be perfect for his new vision of the game. Having found his ad in the programming schedule for Anthrocon 2011, Reynard contacted Jan with his crazy idea for him to become Lead Artist for the project. The ad pointed to Swords and Sausages (now Reynard&rsquo;s favorite webcomic), which showcased Jan&rsquo;s vibrant imagination and his talents as an artist.&#10;&#10;Jan quickly became the Lead Artist for Tails and Tactics and development continued for almost two years before finally releasing at Anthrocon 2013. Thanks to the pledges of many wonderful people on IndieGoGo, Series 1 of Tails and Tactics became a reality.&#10;&#10;Objective of the Game:&#10;To win. Duh.&#10;In order to do that, though, you must fight through your opponent's front line and attack his or her base enough to deplete its health to 0 - before they do so to you.&#10;Each player begins the game with 30 Base Health. Base Health is lost when a unit controlled by an opposing player attacks your base (represented by you, the player). They may only do so, though, when you have no units on the field to defend with. If you do have units on the field that are able to defend, opponents must remove them before being able to attack your base directly.&#10;1 base health is lost per attack, no matter how powerful (or weak) the attacking unit is. Some powerful units make up for this by having the ability to attack multiple times, so watch out!&#10;Base health may also be lost when an opponent attacks one of your units and you choose to dodge the attack. Any dodged attacks will be applied directly to your base.&#10;Once your opponent's base health reaches 0, you are victorious! Gloating and victory dances are acceptable at this point.&#10;&#10;",

The deck of 98 cards can be whittled down to a standard 52-card deck to play all the classics, though it contains 6 full standard suits and plenty more, including story suits for storytelling games (with images), 3 colored suits, and 6 minor elemental suits that have no problem sharing their cards with other elemental suits.&#10;&#10;The cards are orientation-dependent, so the properties they take on will differ depending on whether they are played right-side-up or upside-down.&#10;&#10;In addition to playing some of your favorite card games, you can use the deck to create new games. The different types of suits can be played separately or mixed and matched for tons of unique gameplay possibilities.&#10;&#10;Some of the ways the cards can be organized are:&#10;&#10;- Six suits (HEARTS, CROSSES, CLOVERS, TOADSTOOLS, DIAMONDS, and HORNS) numbered 0-14. Aces, Jacks, Queens, and Kings are further marked for use in a standard deck.&#10;&#10;- Three suits (RED, BLUE, and GREEN) numbered 0-29.&#10;&#10;- Two full sets of six suits (EARTH, FIRE, WATER, AIR, MAGIC, and ALCHEMY), numbered 2-9 plus the additional classes ACE, APPRENTICE, MAGICIAN, and WIZARD. These suits come 1, 2, or 3 to a card.&#10;&#10;- Five story suits (WILD, ITEM, EVENT, CHARACTER, and LOCATION). Each card in the deck has a different image that can be used in creative and storytelling games.&#10;&#10;The deck also contains 8 wild cards that can be organized by color (making 4 groups of 2) or by layout (making 2 groups of 4).&#10;&#10;",

An army of unspeakable horrors of an ancient and forgotten race of infernal creatures awoke deep within the earth and marched across the lands. The Darkness ravished the Five Realms with death and destruction and nearly brought the continent to its knees. Faced with a desperate fight for their very survival, the great races put aside their differences and united into a warband of such magnitude and strength as had never been seen before. The world trembled.&#10;&#10;Though their great loss of life on the battlefield was nearly insurmountable, the warband's sheer size overpowered the armies of Darkness and largely drove them back beneath the earth. Sorcerers and shamans and magi of the great races invoked binding blood magic to start sealing the enemy away for an eternity. In the final days of battle to determine the fate of the lands, the hordes of Darkness and the great warband clash on four remaining battle fronts that are each located near a border landmark that separate the kingdoms of the Five Realms.&#10;&#10;The last four campaigns wage on. The end is near. May the Maker protect us all....&#10;&#10;As a player in Warband: Against the Darkness, you control the warband armies of one of the great fantasy races of the Five Realms. Although the great races are currently working together in mutual defense, old habits and rivalries are hard to break and this isn't in any way a co-operative game. It's important that your kind emerges victorious from the war with more battle prestige and honor than your temporary and untrustworthy comrades. The player who collects the most Victory Points of one-upmanship for their race by the conclusion of the final battle against the Darkness &ndash; gained by advancing your soldiers in the warband, earning gold for your army captains, reconnoitering the combat fronts with your scouts, and defeating enemies on the battlefields &ndash; has achieved the greatest leadership glory and is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;Warband: Against the Darkness is perfectly balanced in the design space between Euro and Ameri-style gameplay, combining strategic depth with an evocative fantasy theme and tense player conflict.&#10;&#10;",

Every one of the play pieces has got a certain weight that can have decisive influence on the game.&#10;&#10;The main strategy is to balance between caution (don&rsquo;t be knocked out by your opponents game piece) and greed (capture as much prey as possible).&#10;&#10;Figure it out:&#10;&#10;Hungry Higgs is played on a sort of tilt. This means that weight close to the middle of the board will appear to weigh less than weight situated longer away from the middle. If you capture prey on your opponents half of the board it will appear heavier than if you had captured it from your own half of the board.&#10;&#10;It is also a good idea to figure out the probability for being knocked home by your opponent.&#10;&#10;Steal space:&#10;&#10;If you can place your game piece in the middle of the board &ndash; but in safe distance from your opponent &ndash; do it. Thus your opponent will have trouble to make a safe move when it is his turn.&#10;&#10;Find out what kind of risk you want to take to find the balance between capturing prey, stealing space or being knocked home.&#10;&#10;Tricks:&#10;&#10;Keeping up appearances:&#10;&#10;Perhaps your opponent is able to knock you home &ndash; but he might be more interested in capturing preys. Don&rsquo;t let him discover that he can knock you home.&#10;&#10;",

The earlier you place your bet, the more you can win &mdash; should you guess correctly, of course. Camels don't run neatly, however, sometimes landing on top of another one and being carried toward the finish line. Who's going to run when? That all depends on how the dice come out of the pyramid dice shaker, which releases one die at a time when players pause from their bets long enough to see who's actually moving!&#10;&#10;",

This is not obvious. Instead, it appears to be square due to the commonplace elongation of the diagonal dimension and/or shortening of the orthogonal dimension which is the universal convention for representing them.&#10;This implicates why a perfect mapping onto the surface of a 3-D sphere, from a circle rather than a square, is ideally suitable and achievable.]&#10;&#10;Fortunately, the players are not required to deal with any complex, confusing 3-D curvature characteristic to a spherical playing surface.&#10;&#10;This is the advantage to using flat 2-D representations of a spherical-surface, 3-D chess variant.&#10;&#10;",

The 4 &quot;clans&quot; have a parallel to classic card &quot;suits&quot; and achieving clan &quot;supremacy&quot; is akin to having a suit being &quot;trump&quot;.&#10;&#10;Cards are dealt to each player, and then players bid for the three treasure cards in the center of the table. The highest bidder receives those cards.&#10;&#10;A trick is led, and players must follow suit if they are able. If not, they may play a card of another clan, but the combat strength is reduced.&#10;&#10;Advanced rules:&#10;- Certain cards can be swapped out for others that add another dimension to play&#10;&#10;- Players can be dealt &quot;roles&quot; which grant them access to 2 &quot;powers&quot;: one activated if they lose the high bid, and another if they win the bid. The powers range from forced card exchanges to card value shifts.&#10;&#10;In 2016 the base game comes bundled with the &quot;Dwarven Kingdom&quot; expansion (PNH0301).&#10;&#10;",

Place the bones into the Bone Bucket, mix them well, and slide the Power Switch to On. &#10;5. Shuffle the Bone Cards and place them face down in front of Bruno.&#10;&#10;To Play:&#10;1. After deciding the order of play, the first player takes one card from the top of the pile and shows it to the other players. The Player then removes the number and color of bones from the Bone Bucket as indicated on the card.&#10;&#10;2. After the player successfully removes the bones indicated on the card, the next player draws a card from the pile and so on.&#10;&#10;3. Following the instructions on the card, the players take turns carefully removing the bones from the Bone Bucket.&#10;&#10;4. Whenever a player disturbs the Bone Bucket and wakes Bruno, he will jump and bark at the player, disqualifying them from the game. After putting Bruno back to sleep (see Step 3 in the To Set Up section), the other players continue to remove bones in turn until only one player remains that player is the winner.&#10;&#10;5. If players remove all the bones from the Bone Bucket without walking Bruno, the game ends in a tie.&#10;&#10;6. If a player draws a blank card, that player may skip their turn without having to remove any bones.

Choose or roll your number (d6) in the beginning of the game. If YOU roll your number on your turn, you get 2 points. If anyone else rolls your number on THEIR turn, you get 1 point. Every 5 points that you obtain you get to roll an extra dice (starting with one, max of 5). If anyone, including you, ever rolls your number two times or more you get to choose a mice or rat card. Mice cards help you, Rat cards hurt other players (i.e. Fat Rat- Roll 1 less die). After scoring 25 points, you enter the cheese phase where you then have the option of pulling cheese cards if more than one of your number is rolled. Cheese cards give you extra points based on the cheese card. The first player to 50 points wins!&#10;&#10;The game is for 2-6 players and takes about 15 minutes to play.&#10;&#10;",

The desert around them is filled with the shattered husks of buildings, and with marauding gangs of bandits. The Survivors are doing their best to keep the Marauders at bay. Some have even been recruited by the heroes to help search through this wasteland, scavenging Resources.&#10;&#10;The good news is that they've heard radio broadcasts from a settlement called Salvation, which claims to be a safe haven with plenty of food and water. The Characters need to save up enough Resources to make the long journey down the dangerous highway, in hopes of reaching safety from the Marauders.&#10;&#10;Can they survive long enough to get themselves, and the people under their protection, to Salvation?&#10;&#10;Salvation Road is a co-operative game for 1 to 4 (up to 8 with a Scenario) players that plays in about an hour. In the standard game players are assigned 2 Characters (1 Hero and 1 Survivor). Both Characters are useful but you must deal with the Survivor's limitations and exploit the Hero's strengths to succeed. While scavenging resources in a post apocalyptic wasteland may sound easy, try doing it with the marauders on your tail, wounding you every chance they get.&#10;&#10;",

Watts (Railway Rivals and others) for the Greater Glasgow Passenger Transport Executive as part of publicity to show how easy it was to get around Glasgow and the surrounding areas (of west Central Scotland) using public transport.&#10;&#10;It is a race game comprising a number of short rounds (the rules suggest 3 or 4), where each player starts from a randomly allocated railway station, and must visit three places of interest (in any order) using a combination of overground rail, underground/subway system (affectionately known as &quot;The Clockwork Orange&quot;) or buses, then return to their start point to win that round. The person to get back &quot;home&quot; first scores 5 points, the others scoring one point for each site of interest reached. The overall winner is the person with most points at the end of the pre-agreed number of rounds.&#10;&#10;The board is made up of a hexagonal base, overprinted with the main rail routes, stations and places of interest (that the players must visit). Each round has a different theme - shopping centres, scenic locations, sports stadia, etc. Players roll two dice if they want to travel by train or subway, and one die if travelling by bus. Certain die rolls will result in &quot;incident&quot; cards, which may force a detour, a missed turn etc.&#10;&#10;2-6 players, but best with 3-4.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;Game Board&#10;Rules (1p)&#10;2 6-sided dice&#10;8 Hexagonal plastic playing pieces with a Bus on one face, and a Train on the opposite&#10;30 Destination Cards&#10;14 Rail Incident Cards&#10;14 Bus Incident Cards&#10;&#10;",

To win, the two players must complete objectives and reach the center of the board.&#10;&#10;The players take turns trying to fulfill the current common emotional objective by discarding emotion cards to move from node to node. They must do this without verbal communication, empathizing and always considering each other's situation when making a move.&#10;&#10;A player can use their own cards or their partner's, but if their move causes their partner to be unable to move, the players lose and the game ends. While moving from node to node, their balance shifts, and they are not able to refill their hand.&#10;&#10;The game features a card-splaying mechanism in which players change their &quot;perspective&quot; to reveal a new set of options.&#10;&#10;The players win by meeting in the center while in a balanced state and within one turn of each other - something quite difficult, and therefore very rewarding when achieved.&#10;&#10;...and then we held hands. features art by beloved French illustrator Marie Cardouat, known for the art found in beautiful games such as Dixit, Steam Park, and Marrakech.&#10;&#10;",
