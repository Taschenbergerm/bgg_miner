        "description": "Finals Fever is a simulation of Australian football played on a board measuring 68cm by 48cm, representative of a football oval with spectators, and including a set of &quot;decision cards&quot; to govern umpiring decisions, plus two dice and a counter representing the ball. The playing area is separated into squares, some with position names inscribed on them, some bearing the letter &quot;D&quot; (for decision card), and others blank. There is a space for the decision cards which are shuffled and placed face down in a pile. The ball is moved in accordance with dice rolls, with the aim being to maintain possession by ensuring that the ball lands on one of the dice roller's own position squares. If the ball lands on a &quot;D&quot; square play continues as per the instructions on the decision card at the top of the pile. If the ball lands on a blank square, possession goes to the other player. When playing from a position square both dice are rolled; when intercepting the ball from a blank square only a single die is used. The ultimate aim is to score goals (worth 6 points) and behinds (worth 1 point) by moving the ball through the appropriate posts at either end of the playing field.&#10;&#10;",

The wizards summon creatures to fight to the death. The winner is the last player left in the game.&#10;&#10;A board section is supplied for each wizard that is partaking in the game and places it at the start of the game.&#10;&#10;Each turn the wizards collect energy (magic crystals) from their current space, if it happens to be a space matching their own element type they will gain more crystals, next the wizards can move and select up to two creatures they may have summoned to move, landing on a strategic area of the board can make a big difference between success and failure. Once movement has been performed it&rsquo;s time for any creatures of opposing wizards sharing a space to battle to the death, during the battle phase a creature can battle a wizard and if they win that wizard is eliminated and their part in the game is over. Once all the battles have been fought the wizards can summon a new creature to aid them in the conquest, if they happen to share a space matching their own element type they can summon two. Lastly new spells (creature counters) are collected and replenished, some are expired and returned to the counter pool ready for the next turn when each wizard left in the game must gather their thoughts and put their minds to their next strategy and prepare for the actions from the remaining wizards left in the game.&#10;&#10;Each turn is broken down into steps which each wizard will perform before the next step begins. By placing their wizard and creatures in strategic positions the players can gain an important edge over their opponent that could be the difference between success and failure. A wizard in control of the elements will ultimately bring about the destruction of his enemy and rejoice in victory.&#10;&#10;",

Players have 5 different game play styles to choose from and can play with different amounts of cards, in a half deck, full deck, or custom deck format. This is an &ldquo;E-Rated&rdquo; card game, sure to get your family involved, and easy enough for anyone to enjoy.&#10;&#10;There are 10 decks to choose from: Ninja, Pirates, Aliens, Robots, Monsters, Undead, Ghosts, Vampires, Werewolves, and Zombies.&#10;&#10;The game is designed to bridge the gap between games for really young children such as: &quot;Uno,&quot; &quot;Crazy 8's,&quot; and &quot;Old Maid,&quot;  and games for older children such as:  &quot;Magic the Gathering,&quot; &quot;Pokemon,&quot; etc.  It is designed to be an easy to pick up and play card game for children ages 6+, families, and casual players.  There are multiple ways to play the game, multiple decks to build, and players can even make up rules once they get comfortable with the gameplay. The trading card and custom deck options are just that...options, and are not required to play the game, unless you want to, and that is always welcomed!&#10;&#10;War Fighters can be played by anyone, of any age, at any time, in multiple ways, without having to spend hours on rules getting confusing.&#10;&#10;Basic Game Play (#1):&#10;-Divide one deck in half evenly and give each half to a player.&#10;-Each player will receive:  5 square fighters (Paper), 5 circle fighters (Rock), 5 ex fighters (Scissors), 4 attacks, 2 blocks, 2 truces, and 2 star leader fighter cards for a total of 25 cards in the basic version of the game.&#10;-Each player shuffles their half decks&#10;-Each player puts their decks to the left as their &quot;draw pile.&quot;&#10;-Each player draws 5 cards.&#10;-At the same time, each player plays a fighter card in the play area between them.  A fighter card will have a symbol of a circle, square, ex, or star on it.&#10;-To determine who wins, Square beats Circle, Circle beats Ex, Ex beats Square, Star beats all.&#10;-If both players play the same cards (ex:  circle vs. circle) then &quot;war&quot; is initiated and each player draws 3 cards from the draw pile and places it face down into the play area, and then plays another fighter card for the win. War continues until someone wins.  Each time the same cards are played, war is initiated again.&#10;-The winner of each round gets all the cards in the play area and puts them into their &quot;discard pile&quot; to their right.&#10;-When the cards in the play area are the same, players must draw the 3 cards and lay them face down followed by another fighter card.  However, when the cards are different (ex:  circle vs. square) a player can then decide if they want to use an &quot;attack&quot; card, &quot;block&quot; card, or a &quot;truce&quot; card.&#10;-An &quot;attack&quot; card is basically a &quot;+1&quot; or &quot;one up&quot; to the other player for the win.&#10;-A &quot;truce&quot; card means you do not want to fight anymore and want your card back, so both players get their cards back.&#10;-A player can choose to &quot;block&quot; an &quot;attack&quot; card as a defense to try and win the round.  A &quot;truce&quot; card cannot be blocked in the basic version of the game.&#10;-After each round, each player draws back up to 5 cards for the next round.&#10;-Each player can use their full hand in each round as needed, but can only use one fighter card during a round, unless  &quot;war&quot; has been initiated and the three face down cards need to be drawn.&#10;-It takes one attack and one circle to beat a square, one attack and one square to beat an ex, and one attack and an ex to beat a  circle card.&#10;-If a star card is thrown, it takes two unblocked attacks plus any fighter card (square, circle, ex) to beat the star card&#10;-The objective of the game, or how to win, is to collect all the leader cards from the other player.&#10;-On a 5 card hand, if a player does not have any fighter cards, they must show the other player their hand to prove they are not cheating, hand over one of their cards, shuffle all their cards, and draw a new 5 card hand.&#10;-During war, if a player does not have a fighter card to finish the round, that player must count the number of cards in their hand, shuffle all their cards, and draw another hand with that number of cards.&#10;&#10;Game Play #2 - (War Strategies):&#10;-During this game style, players can choose to use attack, defense, and truce cards in order raise the stakes before going to war and/or to cancel out the war.  So, when players use the same cards (Ex:  circle vs. circle), the attack, block, and truce cards can now be played.&#10;&#10;Game Play #3 - (Aggressive Vs. Defensive):&#10;-In this style of play, one person gets all the attack cards to start with, while the other gets all the blocks and truce cards.&#10;-As an additional rule, one of the players can get the &quot;power&quot; card as well.&#10;-The &quot;power&quot; card acts as 2 attack cards.  When used as an attack card, if a player wins the round, the other player's fighter card is taken out of the game until it is over, making the game go even faster.  Star Leader cards cannot be taken out of the game since they are needed in order to win the game.&#10;&#10;Game Play #4 - (Power Cards):&#10;-In this mode, the loser of the previous round gets to use the power card to help &quot;even the odds.&quot;&#10;-One power card comes in each box.&#10;&#10;Game Play #5 - (Custom Deck Options):&#10;-In this option, players can play half decks, full decks, or customs decks, and build their own decks to battle with.&#10;-Players can choose if the cards are deck specific as well.  For example, if one person uses ninjas and the other uses pirates, the you can assume that pirates do not know how to throw ninja attack darts or stricken, and therefore the cards are no good to pirates and only the ninja cards the player acquires can use those attacks.  This option is a bit advanced so most players who play this tend to put the other players fighter cards to the side and use the attacks, blocks, truce, and power cards in a non-deck specific mode.&#10;&#10;Extra Game Information:&#10;-This game is very open so players who are comfortable with the rules tend to master it and then make up their own rules for added fun.&#10;-All decks play the same, but have different artwork to cater to everyones passions.&#10;-This game can also be used to play &quot;matching games,&quot; where you lay cards face down and try to pair them up.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Lagoon is a game in which 1-4 players (4 play as opposing teams of 2) each lead a circle of druids to shape the fantastical world of Lagoon by harnessing the power of its magical lands to bend destiny. The landscape bristles with three divine energies. Every player action alters the balance of power among those energies, and thus the players collectively determine Lagoon&rsquo;s destiny. One divine energy shall inherit Lagoon, and the player who best served it wins!&#10;&#10;The world is built using hexagonal tiles, and a new tile is drawn from a bag each time a druid explores a site. Site tiles are double-sided, and each side represents a different mystical site offering a unique magical power to the druids. Each site is also enchanted with one of three divine energies: Elemeen, Vowelon and Deonin. Since the two sides of a site tile are always linked to different energies, every site explored presents a choice of which energy to advance over the other two, as well as what magic will be put into the world for use by the druids. Players also strategically deploy their druids to unravel sites aligned with an energy they choose to oppose, removing such sites from the world and tipping the balance of power towards the other two energies.&#10;&#10;The energy with the most sites in play at the end of the game becomes Lagoon's destiny, and the player who most supported that dominant energy is the winner. Support is tracked in two ways. First, whenever exploring a site and expanding an energy's reach in Lagoon, the exploring player gains a divine seed token matching the explored site's energy. These seeds can be spent in various ways over the course of the game, but any seeds of the dominant energy remaining in a player's supply at the end of the game are worth 1 point each. Secondly, whenever a player unravels a site, it is removed from play and placed in front of that player. At the end of the game, unraveled sites not matching the dominant energy are worth 2 points each.&#10;&#10;",

Next, each player chooses a windmill from the board and takes either one of these actions: place a piece on its ring, turn around a whole ring -just a quarter-, change a piece of the board for a new one.&#10;&#10;In case of a tie, the player with more small windmills in the canal to the center wins. &#10;&#10;&#10;",

Just as in that game, the board consists of a 6x6 board build up with tiles. These tiles have 3 characteristics: form (square, triangle or circle), color (blue, red, green, yellow or white) and size (big or small). Next to that, each player puts a home tile next to one of the corners in his own color. To move the tiles around you can move a tile horizontally of vertically if 1 characteristic with the adjacent tile corresponds. To move diagonally, 2 characteristics have to correspond. Different to Katoiz, instead of rolling dice to determine which tile you can move on your turn, here you move tiles in a fixed order by color.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to collect a stack of four tiles on your home tile.&#10;&#10;",

It is a derivative of Hippos & Crocodiles by the same designer.&#10;&#10;It uses a type of puzzle piece that has been around for more than a century: the pentomino, and also the concept of harvesting (picking items already placed on the board).&#10;&#10;RULES&#10;&#10;Start by drawing a rectangular grid of any size. 10x10 is recommended for beginners, but for more than 2 players you might need a bigger grid.&#10;&#10;Secondly, and by turn, each player chooses a different pentomino shape. This pentomino will be his &lsquo;harvester&rsquo;, and the only piece he will use during the game.&#10;&#10;The player that chose a shape in first place draws two coins in any empty cells of the grid.&#10;&#10;Then, starting with the second player, players take turns doing the following:&#10;&#10;1. Draw your harvester on the board, so it doesn&rsquo;t overlap other previously drawn pentominos and no parts of it land outside the board. You can (and should) draw it so it overlaps some coins. Notice that you can draw it rotated or symmetrized, as long as it fits with the grid.&#10;2. Score as many coins as the pentomino has covered&#10;3. Draw another 2 coins in any two empty spaces (not occupied by coins or pentominoes).&#10;4. Pass your turn to the next player.&#10;&#10;If you&rsquo;re not capable of legally drawing a pentomino (no room for it) you must pass your turn. If all players pass in succesion the game ends. The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;As a variant, before the game starts players can agree on the number of coins drawn each turn.&#10;&#10;",

A brave wizard and a ruthless sorcerer will try to guide wisely their golems to take the relics from their enemy.&#10;&#10;Alerya is an Essentia derivative by the same designer, that uses a different board, new terrain tiles and magic relics.&#10;&#10;A player wins when she manages to steal the two relics of her enemy, or possess more enemy relics than the other player when all the golems of an Order (hers or her opponent&rsquo;s) have been eliminated. If there is a draw, the player with remaining golems on the board wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

In Dogfight players strive to collect then play sets of cards in order to shoot down their opponents. The game is over when only one side remains, or when the victory conditions of the scenario being played are met.&#10;&#10;The game features set collection, card drafting, and variable player powers.&#10;&#10;Dogfight contains 54 cards used to form the draw deck during the game. Each card is from one of six Attack Sets, as noted by the title across the top of the card: Crossing Shot, Diving Shot, Head On Shot, Strafing Run, Trailing Shot, and Turning Shot.&#10;&#10;Attack Sets may have special conditions governing when the set can be played. Before trying to damage an enemy plane, you must collect a number of cards from the same Attack Set equal to the card&rsquo;s Set Size. These cards are then played together as a Bid for Damage. If the attack is successful, then the target plane suffers damage equal to the Damage Value listed on the cards.&#10;&#10;Some cards in the deck have a Defensive Value and can be used to avoid an enemy attack.&#10;&#10;The draw deck is also used for randomly assigning specific types of damage to target planes. For each point of damage inflicted, one card is flipped over from the draw deck and the listed damage is applied. The information along the bottom of the card is used solely for this purpose, and is ignored during the set collection portions of the game.&#10;&#10;",

Nonetheless, you employ a team of animal control agents and your job is to round up the cats. You win by nabbing five of them.&#10;&#10;Cat Herders is a luckless, 2-player combinatorial game, designed to be an elegant simulation (an evocative simulation using a minimum of rules).&#10;&#10;The game is played on a hex grid. The central dilemma is that, while your goal is to capture cats by moving your herders to next to them, when you move a herder next to a cat, the cat runs away. The only way to capture a cat is approach it at just the right angle and surround it, before your opponent does. It's tricky.&#10;&#10;A good analogy for the feel of play: it's a bit like a multi-player version of chat noir.&#10;&#10;Rules, design background, and an example game can be found here.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Diamonds is a trick-taking card game in which players collect Diamonds &mdash; not cards bearing that suit, mind you, but rather actual &quot;Diamond Crystals&quot; (acrylic crystals) included in the game.&#10;&#10;What makes the game of Diamonds different from other trick-taking card games is that when you cannot follow suit you get a &quot;Suit Action&quot; based on what suit you do play. Suit Actions are also taken by the winner of each trick, as well as at the end of a full Round of play.&#10;&#10;Suit Actions will enable players to take Diamond Crystals from the Supply, moving them to their Showroom (where they may score 1 point) or to their Vault (where they will score 2 points). The Vault is a secure area, but the Showroom is vulnerable to theft by the other players.&#10;&#10;The deck in Diamonds consists of sixty cards, numbered 1-15 in the standard suits. In each round, the players start with a hand of ten cards. One player leads a card, and everyone else must play one card, following suit if possible.  As you play a card, if you cannot follow suit, you immediately get a Suit Action in the suit you did play. The player who played the highest card in the suit that was led wins the trick, and also gets a Suit Action.&#10; The player who won the trick leads a card to start the next trick. After a full Round of ten tricks, whoever has taken the most cards in each suit once again gets a Suit Action. If a player has taken no tricks, that player gets two Diamonds Suit Actions. Players then start a new round.&#10;&#10;Whoever has the most points in Diamond Crystals at the end of the game wins!&#10;&#10;",

If the center space is empty, that player is vulnerable to attack.&#10;&#10;There are five card types: Flags, Items, Monsters, Impacts, and Spells. A player&rsquo;s deck consists of 52 cards: 1 Buddy (a monster card), 1 Flag&mdash;both of which start the game in play&mdash;and a main deck of 50 cards which cannot contain more than four copies of any given card.&#10;&#10;1 booster box contains 30 booster packs. Each pack contains 5 random cards.

The board is seeded with the proxy and blocking tiles and then players take turns playing a tile or replacing a proxy with a matching regular tile and placing the proxy somewhere else.&#10;&#10;When a tile is played it must be next to or one space away from an &quot;object&quot; tile, and must either be one lower or higher than that tile, or equal to it if the play is on one of the starred spaces in the center.&#10;&#10;Points are scored for getting scoring tiles (those numbered 1, 3, or 7) in scoring rows; a scoring row is an orthogonal row of three or four of a player's tiles, but if there are three they must be in sequence (with wraparounds allowed). Points are also scored for creating situations in which the opposing player cannot play.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Thousands of miles from the major theaters of World War II, small British and Italian squadrons struggled to control the entrance to the Red Sea. Cut off from their bases in Europe, the Italian Red Sea Flotilla did its best to close off this vital route leading from India and Australia to the Suez Canal.&#10;&#10;Horn of Africa takes players to this little-known theatre of the Second World War, the battles between the Royal Navy&rsquo;s Red Sea Force and the Regia Marina&rsquo;s Red Sea Flotilla during the East African Campaign of 1940-1941. Ten battle and 15 operational scenarios depict the major actions of the campaign, along with a number of hypothetical situations that examine possible British intervention in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War of 1935-1936, as well as the use of ships on both sides not historically available but which with better preparation in the 1930&rsquo;s or even on the eve of war could have been present.&#10;&#10;Horn of Africa is a complete boxed game in the Second World War at Sea series. There are 40 &ldquo;long&rdquo; ship pieces and 60 square pieces representing small warships, transports, aircraft and markers needed for play. These include the complete Red Sea Flotilla and Red Sea Force, plus some unusual ships planned but never built (or never re-built) by both the Royal Navy and the Regia Marina.&#10;&#10;The operational map depicts the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, including all the major ports and airbases (such as they were) of 1940-42. The tactical map is a generic blue field of hexagons, used to resolve surface combat. There, ships maneuver and fight using their gunnery and torpedo factors. Each player rolls a number of dice according to the ship&rsquo;s capabilities, hitting on a result of 6. Gunnery and torpedo damage tables give the results: Ships can suffer damage to engines, hull or armament. Air attacks are resolved in similar fashion. The combat systems yield results rapidly but in a historically accurate fashion, giving a good balance of fun and insight.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Line or Colour is a combinatorial game for two players. Originally named Tangion (a contraction for Tangent+Tension), the game involves two perpendicular winning conditions that can tie players&acute; brains in knots. It was derived from Domina 4 by adding a n-in-a-row victory condition and removing piece movement.&#10;&#10;The name was later changed to the more friendly Line or Colour.&#10;&#10;MATERIAL&#10;&#10;49 rounded counters in 7 colours (7 each)&#10;25 white rings&#10;25 black rings&#10;The official edition includes a board for faster setup.&#10;&#10;RULES&#10;&#10;There are 2 types of gameplay: basic and advanced.&#10;&#10;Basic version:&#10;&#10;Arrange 25 counters in 5 colours (5 each) in a square according to the figure:&#10;&#10;12345&#10;45123&#10;23451&#10;51234&#10;34512&#10;&#10;Player 'White' (Starting player) takes all the white rings. Player 'Black' takes all the black rings.&#10;&#10;Starting with 'White' players alternate turns 'claiming' a counter by placing a ring of their colour on it. The pie rule is enabled.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player either forms a row of at least 4 consecutive rings of his colour (orthogonal or diagonal) or has claimed 4 counters of the same colour. That player wins the game.&#10;&#10;Advanced version:&#10;&#10;Arrange 49 counters in 7 colours (7 each) according to the figure:&#10;&#10;1234567&#10;6712345&#10;4567123&#10;2345671&#10;7123456&#10;5671234&#10;3456712&#10;&#10;Same rules apply, but a player wins by making a line of 5 or claiming 5 counters of the same colour. The pie rule doesn't seem to be necessary in this version.&#10;&#10;Variant for both versions: Arrange the counters randomly.&#10;&#10;AKNOWLEDGEMENTS&#10;&#10;Special thanks to Stephen Tavener for playtesting and Cameron Browne for playtesting and game name brainstorming, that unlocked its publication almost a year after its inception.&#10;&#10;",

At the start of the game, shuffle the deck, then remove five cards from play unseen. Deal one card face-up to each player.&#10;&#10;Whoever has the lowest card is the first active player. She decides whether to &quot;hit&quot; &mdash; that is, be dealt another card &mdash; or forfeit the round. If she hits and is dealt a card that doesn't match a card she already has in front of her, then the next player clockwise becomes the active player; if the card does match, then the round ends, she keeps one of these matching cards as penalty points, then everyone else discards their cards and a new round begins with each player being dealt a card.&#10;&#10;If the active player forfeits, the round ends and she takes the lowest-valued card visible on the table as penalty points, then a new round begins. Penalty cards remain set aside, even if the deck is shuffled to continue play. If a player acquires more penalty points than the predetermined threshold, then the game ends and this player loses. (Alternatively, players can use coins to track scores between games, with the loser paying everyone one coin, paying her score in coins to the player with the lowest score, etc.)&#10;&#10;There are many versions of Pairs from Cheapass Games. The base game play is identical, but the artwork (and artist) vary across the versions. Some include special game rules relevant to the theme of the deck. In general, you can find new/experimental/user-submitted rules at the Cheapass website, and many non-English versions of Pairs also include rules for additional games to play with this deck.&#10;&#10;",

Each day, the players discuss who among them is a Werewolf, and vote out a player. Each night, the Werewolves choose a player to eliminate, while the Seer learns if one player is a Werewolf or not. The game is over when either all the Villagers or all the Werewolves are eliminated.&#10;&#10;Ultimate Werewolf, a new edition of the award-winning, best-selling werewolf title from B&eacute;zier Games, has been reimagined to allow new players to quickly get up and running, with a larger box, totally rewritten and simplified rules, and a guide for the included roles. With all-new art and a great new card design, it's the perfect way to introduce groups of 7-30 people to Werewolf.&#10;&#10;",

The Villagers don't know who the Werewolves are, and the Werewolves are trying to remain undiscovered while they slowly eliminate the Villagers one at a time. A Moderator (who isn't on a team) runs the game.&#10;&#10;Ultimate Werewolf takes place over a series of game days and nights. Each day, the players discuss who among them is a Werewolf and vote out a player. Each night, the Werewolves choose a player to eliminate, while the Seer learns whether one player is a Werewolf or not. The game is over when either all the Villagers or all the Werewolves are eliminated.&#10;&#10;Ultimate Werewolf: Deluxe Edition features all new artwork, a great new design, totally rewritten and more comprehensive rules, and an even better moderator scorepad. What's more, it supports more players than ever: 75 of your closest friends can converge on one or more villages using the components in this box.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Disintegrate your friends!&#10;&#10;Ray Gun Roulette is a high tech, high stakes game of bluffing for 2 to 10 players. Players are participating in this deadly game to acquire as many crystals as they can. Choose from an assortment of highly illegal firearms and blast away until you're either the last player alive or you possess all the crystals!&#10;&#10;Each player starts with two primary shields (blue gems) and three crystals (the currency of the game). If a player runs out of crystals they have lost the game. A primary shield can absorb one blast from one of these lethal firearms, if a player gets hit with just one of these weapons unshielded, they will get disintegrated, and lose the game. The weapon cards contain all the information needed to use them.&#10;&#10;Each weapon, in addition to the illustration and weapon name, have a number of features,&#10;-Kill-o-watt rating: the power rating of the weapon, if both players are targeting each other, the higher kill-o-watt weapon wins and damages their target.&#10;-Deflector shield rating: some weapons have a built-in deflector shield. It can deflect a shot coming from a player that you are not targeting this round. If the kill-o-watt rating is less than or equal to the deflector shield rating (remember to multiply the deflector rating by 1,000 before comparing) the shot has no effect. Otherwise the shot goes through and can be absorbed by a primary shield or disintegrate the player.&#10;-Special ability: each weapon has a unique special ability. Some of these can be particularly game-changing and devastating. Any player may negate the special ability of a weapon at the cost of one crystal (thrown into the pot for the current round), once per round, immediately after the effect would have taken place.&#10;&#10;A round of Ray Gun Roulette has a number of phases,&#10;-Choose weapons, dealer deals each player 3 cards, they choose one and discard the rest.&#10;-Ante up!, each player places a crystal in the pot.&#10;-Aim, players pick a target, making a &quot;gun&quot; hand pointing at them. This stage is when the bluffing really takes place, feel free to switch targets, intimidate, trash talk, and fold at any time.&#10;-Last chance, Dealer declares &quot;Last chance to fold, targets locked!&quot;. From this point on players cannot switch targets. Players may not fold once this phase has ended.&#10;Fire!, all together players call out &quot;3, 2, 1, FIRE!&quot; and flip over their cards, revealing what weapons they were using.&#10;-Determine winners, Determining the winner is simple; if you lost a primary shield this round or were disintegrated, you lost. Otherwise the player has won and will split the pot with the other winners. crystals that cannot be split evenly between the winners remain in the pot for the next round.&#10;-Play continues until either one player has all the crystals or is the only one alive.&#10;&#10;",

Or is it Christopher Columbus that has taken a hammer-head shark and is now hiding out in the Sahara desert?&#10;The player that first unravels the mystery will be crowned the city's new master-detective!&#10;&#10;The players will move about the city, looking for clues as to WHO did the crime, WHAT they stole and WHERE the thief is hiding. The game has been compared to a mixture of Cops 'n' Robbers, Clue and a trivia-game.&#10;&#10;When playing, the players roll the dice and then move about the board, trying to get to the different clue-squares (3 different color-coded clues to each part of the answer exists) where they get a clue as to who did the deed, what they stole or where they are hiding and they also get a clue-chip. These chips can be used to get help from the citys former master-detective if the player has a hard time in figuring out the clues.  &#10;When the player thinks he or she has the correct answer they move to the police-station as quickly as possible and once there they get to write down their guesses. If they have guessed correctly they win the game, otherwise they are out of the game.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The chef that makes the most dishes wins!&#10;&#10;Tabula Pasta is a game where the players are all chefs working at a small Italian restaurant. They are trying to out do each other by getting the most satisfied customers. Each customer's order is determined by rolling three special dice (meat, pasta, and sauce). The chefs must race against each other to fulfil the orders using the cards in their hand, the deck, and the pantry. The chef with the most satisfied customers by the end of the game is the winner!&#10;&#10;The board game is a table, set for four persons. To begin the game you place a meeple (patron) in each chair. Determine each patron's order by rolling their own set of special dice, one each of a sauce, meat, and pasta die. The players (chefs) then have to match the patron's order by drawing cards from the grocery delivery (deck) or the pantry (three piles of discarded cards, shared by everyone, that haven't been used to fill an order). Once an order has been filled the player shows everyone their match, moves the patron next to them to keep score, places the used cards in the bus bin (discard pile, you can never dig from the trash to complete an order, that's gross!), and finally seats a new patron (if any are left) and rolls a new order for them. Play continues until everyone has been served.&#10;&#10;In addition to the six types of pasta, meat, and sauce cards there are also wild cards and secret ingredient cards (a pasta, meat, or sauce that counts as any other type, but you can only use one to fill an order). There are variations for faster games: using less patrons and/or removing the meat cards and dice (light lunch).&#10;&#10;",

The object is to take tricks by playing the highest-ranked animal card. Problem is, when an animal card is played, its rank changes and usually for the worse.&#10;&#10;Before each round, ranking cards are placed on the table in a row in order of rank:  fly, spider, bird, cat, dog, goat, cow, horse. The fly is the lowest ranked at the start, and the horse is the highest. The animal cards are shuffled and dealt. The start player plays a card, and the corresponding card in the rank row is shifted down one space. If an animal is already the lowest ranked animal, it is moved to the furthest space on the right and becomes the highest ranked animal.&#10;&#10;Play proceeds clockwise. In turn, each player plays a card. A player must follow suit if possible, otherwise he may play any card.  Each played card causes the corresponding card in the rank row to shift down as described above.&#10;&#10;After everyone has played, the player whose card matches the currently highest ranked animal wins the trick (regardless of suit). If two or more players have played the same &lsquo;winning&rsquo; card, the player who played first wins the trick.&#10;&#10;This is a 3-4 player game. Partnership rules are included as well.&#10;&#10;",

The round goes on until no player has any action left (i.e. dices).&#10;&#10;The actions vary between perform in underground bars, practice your musics, write new lyrics, buy materials at the music shop, publish a sample CD or just perform at the Casino to get some extra cash. Each of those spaces needs a different combination between quantity of dices and the sum of them.&#10;&#10;Once players have written one or more lyrics, they are ready to try to get the best melody possible for that tune!&#10;&#10;The winner of the game is the player with most points, that will be earned by playing musics during the shows.

After eons of hunting and gathering, feasts and famine, war and peace, your people have finally entered an age of innovation.&#10;&#10;With the advent of horticulture, your tribe has settled into a sedentary way of life and through this change, idle minds have begun to develop new ways of understanding and manipulating the world around them. Great advancements are being made in subsistence, government, technology, culture, commerce, diplomacy, and warfare.&#10;&#10;This sea change has inspired a need for guidance and through careful consideration your people have elected you to lead them into the future.&#10;&#10;Civicus is a civilization themed, tile placement and area control game in which players compete for territories, resources and exotic goods. These essential elements of the game are earned, maintained, and developed through sound logic, thoughtful tile placement, and strategic planning.&#10;&#10;Each round the players will take turns placing new terrain tiles. Strategic tile placement is crucial for a player&rsquo;s success, as this aspect of the game determines the geographical matrix for game play and dictates resource and action point generation. Resources and action points are required for nearly every aspect of the game, including settlement and temple construction, attribute development, and wealth generation.&#10;&#10;Throughout four ages, the players will compete for territory control, by building and developing settlements. In turn, these territories will provide the players with the raw materials required for cultivating a great and powerful nation. The greatness of your nation is determined, in part, by a preset scoring system which focuses heavily on settlement construction, exotic good control, as well as, fortune and fame.&#10;&#10;The nation with the most victory points at the end of the fourth age wins!&#10;          [Crowds cheer&hellip; fireworks erupt&hellip; enemies conspire]&#10;&#10;",

As a demigod, a player initially has access to 24 heroes from which he can choose his army. With his choice he then faces his opponent(s) on sacred battleground.&#10;&#10;There are different game modes regarding picking heroes (chieftain, random, mirror, free pick mode), and regarding conditions on which victory is achieved (skirmish, tactics). It is the game that relies heavy on tactics, that is fairly simple to learn but hard to master and that has a great replayability.&#10;&#10;In time of Chaos, the God of War was supreme ruler over all other gods. But Time of Peace came, and lasted so long that God of War started to lose his power. He grew weaker as the years went by and was pushed to the side by other gods. When his power faded so much that he felt that the end was near he gave the task to his four sons, the demigods, to try to prove themselves as best commanders in the field of battle. The one who can emerge victorious should become the new God of War and bring back the former glory to their name.&#10;&#10;Gather your heroes, challenge your friends, become the God of War!&#10;&#10;",

He/she can defend it or ally to it. To ally, he/she needs to play a card with the same numeric value, without taking into account the faction. The joint attack passes to the next player. This third player can ally or defend too. To defend, he/she needs to play cards from the opposite faction and with a higher number value than the attacking ones. After defending, each player can add more cards to the attack.  If the attack is defended properly the attacking and defending cards are discarded. If it is not, the defending player puts in his hand all attacking and defending cards. When the deck runs out, the first player who runs out of cards is the winner.

Based on the epic &quot;Napoleon's Last Battles&quot;-System, (further upgraded to the Library of Napoleonic Battles): it shows 480 meters per hex, 1 hour per turn, 400-800 men per strength point. Each Approach to Battle game lasts about 20 turns. The Full campaign links the individual battles.&#10;&#10;This game contains five battles from the opening phase of the 1814 Campaign in France following the Battle of Nations, which was fought just half a year before at Leipzig.&#10;&#10;Napoleon has just arrived at the front. At their first encounter the French surprised Bl&uuml;cher's Prussians and Russians during a snowstorm. The Battle of Brienne was a short-lived success, however, for just two days later the Prussians triumphed at La Rothi&egrave;re and wrote-off the enemy as a spent force, advancing hell-for-leather across the Marne and onto the highway to Paris. Ten days later Napoleon seized his opportunity when &quot;Marschal Vorw&auml;rts&quot; allowed his advancing columns to get dispersed and defeated in detail, in rapid succession in three short sharp combats.&#10;&#10;BATTLES SIMULATED &#10;Brienne Unskilled Fury, 29-30 January. &#10;The raw conscripts under Napoleon and Ney chased the Russians and Prussians from the town.

Under a share-the-wealth scheme it is proposed that the Government shall make every man a king and give each person an equal share of the money, after which time each must take care of himself. If a man has good luck and is a shrewd manager, he may beat the game of &quot;inflation.&quot; If he isn't, he will be no better off than theretofore and distribution of the wealth of the country will not have availed him anything&quot;.&#10;&#10;&#10;This game is played like modern Monopoly. From Wikipedia: &quot;Inflation board game came to the attention of Parker Brothers management in the 1930s, after they began sales of Monopoly. Copeland continued sales of the latter game after Parker Brothers attempted a patent lawsuit against him. Parker Brothers held the Magie and Darrow patents, but settled with Copeland rather than going to trial, since Copeland was prepared to have witnesses testify that they had played Monopoly before Darrow's &quot;invention&quot; of the game. The court settlement allowed Copeland to license Parker Brothers' patents&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

It is inspired in equal parts by Sudoku and Triple Triad.&#10;&#10;There are two players, both with a handful of six-sided dice.&#10;&#10;On each player's turn, he rolls a die and place it on a space within a 4&times;4 grid.&#10;&#10;When players place a die in a space horizontally or vertically adjacent to an opponent&rsquo;s die, they check the numbers on the two dice that are facing each other. If the number on the current player's die is greater, the opponent&rsquo;s die is converted to the current player's color.&#10;&#10;Players continue placing dice and converting die colors until all the spaces in the 4&times;4 area are filled. Once this occurs, the game is over and the players tally their scores.&#10;&#10;The game usually comes down to the wire, with the winner achieving victory by the skin of his teeth.&#10;&#10;",

The players form two mafia families that are confronting one another, and each of the families elects its own &quot;godfather&quot; at the start of the game; the goal of the game is to eliminate the head of the rival family.&#10;&#10;Each round starts with a planning phase in which players must secretly prepare the actions they plan to take &mdash; attack, defend, or business &mdash; but players cannot speak to one another during this phase. They must use their intuition to develop plans as a team, predicting the actions of both allies and enemies. Once all players have decided, they act in order.&#10;&#10;While the attack and defend actions are somewhat obvious, for the business action players draw from the business deck, gaining cards that enhance their attacks, potentially save allies from complicated situations, and more.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Fief: France 1429 is a game of dynastic ambition in which players assume the roles of nobles in the 15th century kingdom of France. Each player strives to become the most powerful ruling force in the kingdom by gaining control of Fief and Bishopric territories. In turn, they acquire Royal and Ecclesiastical (church) titles which give their families influence to elect the next Pope and King. Players strengthen their positions by negotiating marriage alliances between their families, setting the stage for love, treachery and deception!&#10;&#10;Fief is a classic French-language game and is being re-introduced by Academy Games in English with updated rules, new units, a new and larger consolidated map, and more. This edition also includes additional components, which enhances game play.&#10; The game board represents a portion of the Kingdom of France in the Middle Ages. Villages have square outlines that are connected by roads that allow Lord and Troop movement. The villages are grouped into eight colored background areas that represent individual Fiefs, which are domains given to Lords to preside over. Fiefs have different colored backgrounds and Bishoprics have heavy bordered outlines that include several different Fiefs. Each village also belongs to one of five church Bishoprics; each Bishopric is outlined with a heavy border line and is numbered between 1-5 along the edge of the board inside a Bishop's Mitre.&#10;&#10;Each player controls up to four family members, comprised of male and female nobles. These family members will rise in power by gaining Royal and Ecclesiastic Titles.&#10;&#10;In Fief: France 1429, a player may attempt to gain control of all the villages in a Fief to gain the Royal Title of Baron, Earl or Duke. For each Fief a player controls, he gains 1 VP. These Titled Lords may now take part in the election for the next King. They may even be a candidate to become King, thus bringing 1 VP and more power to the family! Other members of your family may follow the calling of the Church to gain the Ecclesiastical Titles of Bishop and then Cardinal. These titles allow you to Tithe Bishoprics, taking the Church's (i.e. &quot;your&quot;) fair share of income from other Fief Lords! The highest goal your clerical family member can attain is to be elected Pope, bringing 1 VP and special privileges to your family!&#10; You win the game as soon as you have 3 VPs. This is easier said than done and you may need to form alliances with other players through diplomacy and marriage to obtain your goal. When one of your family members marries a noble of another family, the two of you become allied. You now win the game together with 4 VPs and cannot win alone, unless your marriage is annulled by the Pope or your spouse is &quot;mysteriously&quot; murdered or dies of some other foul means!&#10;&#10;In addition to being wary of your fellow players, you may draw event cards that can quickly change your destiny. Bounty Event cards are beneficial to the Player and include &quot;Good Harvest&quot;, &quot;Good Weather&quot; and &quot;Added Taxes&quot; cards. But some cards are Disaster Cards that can randomly effect all players in specific Bishoprics. These include &quot;The Plague&quot;, &quot;Heavy Rain&quot;, &quot;Famine&quot;, and &quot;Peasant Uprisings&quot;!&#10;&#10;Income can be increased by players imposing church tithes on their opponent's villages or taxing their own Fiefs. Players may purchase new Fief titles, improve their village incomes with mills, and fortify their cities.&#10;&#10;Players will also need to protect their land and castles. Men at Arms and Knights can be purchased, as well as Siege Engines. If you feel that other players are not running their Fiefs as well as you can, you may try to invade their territories! But you must risk one of your family members to lead the troops into possible battle, where they might be killed or taken prisoner. If two opposing armies are in the same village square, a Battle may be initiated. The players assess the size and strength of their armies, which determine the number of Battle Dice each may roll. Each &quot;f&quot; rolled is a hit. Men at Arms are defeated with one hit, while Knights require three hits to be removed from the battle.&#10;&#10;The Kickstarter Edition of Fief: France 1429 included the Fief: France 1429 Expansions Pack and offered 3-D buildings and metal coins as 'add ons.' These items are all still available directly from Academy Games.&#10;&#10;This game is the most recent edition of Fief. It re-implements: &#10;&#10;    Fief (first original edition, 1981)&#10;    Fief 2 (second edition with updated rules, 1989)&#10;    Fief (third edition with completely revised rules and material, 2011)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",

To succeed, you'll need a captain's steady nerve and the help of Lady Luck to land your cargo where it's needed. You have ships full of passengers and precious cargo, but can you outrun pirate robbers, terrifying storms and a stock market crash that might devalue your goods?&#10;&#10;Manifest is a game of cargo ships, sea scoundrels, and nautical mayhem. Win points for your shipping company by completing Contracts. Pick up the required goods or passengers at their source, then navigate the high seas to deliver them to their destination. With a choice of private and public contracts and multi-purpose action cards, there are many paths to victory, and some &quot;take that&quot; options to make sure your opponents don't steal the limelight.&#10;&#10;Manifest can be played in two ways: Standard and Expert. The Standard game is the introductory and family game. The Expert game builds on this, with a deck-buying and building mechanism replacing the blind card draw, thus adding another level of strategy that confident players may prefer.&#10;&#10;",

Look for an Unusual card - there's one in every 360 cards and a Very Unusual card - there's one in every 720 cards. Collect them to increase your odds of winning.&#10;&#10;The object of Res-Q is to save the 'patient' and thereby win cards.&#10;--==--&#10;&#10;Each card has 2 functions:&#10;&#10;1. Scenario &#10;2. Equipment, vehicles and personnel&#10;&#10;Each player in turn chooses a scenario and the other player plays equipment etc. Then the scenario card is flipped and points allocated from the played cards. If the requisite points have been reached the scenario is successfully completed. The player who is successful takes all the cards as points.&#10;&#10;",

The theme is almost the same but instead of buying properties, players buy shares of companies.&#10;&#10;On his turn, a player rolls one die and moves that number of spaces around the board. If the player lands on an as-yet-unowned company share, he has the opportunity to buy it and add it to his portfolio (there is no option to auction it). The more shares of one company a player owns, the more profit he will gain when any other player lands on the company. There are no houses or hotels in this game.&#10;&#10;There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes or collect income.&#10;&#10;The main difference between Makler Gie&#197;&#130;dowy and Monopoly is the marketplace. Every time the player passes by the marketplace, he can go to it. Depending on the number thrown on the die the player may buy 1, 2, 3 or 4 shares. Selling is unlimited. Just before acquiring the player draws a market card which shows the price change. The share may be more or less expensive. It is possible to buy every unowned share in the game. It is not possible to buy shares from another players or sell them. There is no negotiation in this game and the trading is allowed only through the marketplace.&#10;&#10;The game ends when first player goes bankrupt. The most wealthy player is declared the winner. There is also a variant when the game ends when all but one player go bunkrupt.&#10;&#10;",

An active player rolls a die which determines both the money wagered on the round and if the round will use pictures, captions, or the player's choice. A card is drawn from the deck for each player, who must then pair it with an opposite card from their hand.&#10;&#10;In the voting round, each player has a funny token and a die token with identical backs. Players place a funny token on the funniest pair and a die token on the least funny (players may not vote for themselves). A tie leads to a run-off vote. The tokens are flipped up and the player with the most funny tokens takes the money wagered. The next player then rolls the die for a new round.&#10;&#10;When a player loses all their money, the game ends. The player with the most money wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

While you begin armed only with the courage of the free peoples of Middle-earth, you will add new, more powerful cards to your deck as you go. Your goal is to defeat the deadly forces that serve Sauron as you make way towards Mount Doom to destroy The One Ring.&#10;&#10;Each player takes on the role an iconic hero from The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King including Aragorn, &Eacute;owyn, King Th&eacute;oden, Legolas &amp; Gimli, Frodo &amp; Samwise, Merry, or Pippin. Each hero comes with a special card unique to that character and usable only by that player.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with his own basic ten-card deck and draws a hand of five cards each turn. Power is the currency you will use to buy new, stronger cards to add to your deck. The goal of a deck-building game is to craft your personal deck into a well-oiled machine with the six types of cards that can be acquired: Enemies, Allies, Artifacts, Maneuvers, Fortunes, and Locations. When a player has amassed enough Power, he may defeat more powerful enemies from the &quot;Archenemy&quot; deck, including Shelob, The Witch-King, and the Eye of Sauron! Each card acquired during the game has a Victory Point (VP) value with the Archenemy cards providing the most VPs. In the end, whoever has the most VPs wins.&#10;&#10;Whether played on its own or combined with the other LotR deck-building games from Cryptozoic, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King Deck-Building Game introduces a new feature to the game: a map of &quot;The Journey of the Ring&quot;. Can you deliver The One Ring to Mount Doom, then destroy it? Some of the cards you play will move the Ring of Power towards Mount Doom on the map, while the minions of Sauron will delay the Ring on its journey. If you fail to destroy The One Ring, Sauron may be too powerful to overcome...&#10;&#10;Cryptozoic's The Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit deck-builder series:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring Deck-Building Game&#10;     The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers Deck-Building Game&#10;     The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King Deck-Building Game&#10;     The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey Deck-Building Game&#10;     The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug Deck-Building Game Expansion Pack&#10;&#10;&#10;",

It was superseded by In Harm's Way Tactics which incorporates many of the mechanics of HofI.&#10;&#10;Heroes of the Imperium is a cooperative card/board game set in a science fantasy universe called the Imperium Chronicles. Up to five players work together as heroes on missions against the enemies of the Imperium (Solo play is also supported).&#10;&#10;Each new game begins with players choosing from one of six hero archetypes: Assassin, Duelist, Grunt, Medic, Officer, and Psi Mage. Each hero is represented by a Stat card listing his attributes and default abilities/attacks. Each hero also has a deck of Ability cards from which the player can choose up to five. Some Ability cards are marked as &quot;Advanced&quot; and count as two cards. This allows players to choose fewer, but more powerful cards if they wish.&#10;&#10;Once player have chosen their heroes and Ability cards, they select a mission to be played. Each mission description includes which enemies will be encountered and what goals the player must meet to win. An Encounter deck can also be used (especially for solo players) to randomize which enemies will be fought during the mission.&#10;&#10;Each mission also includes a map of the game board. The board consists of several tiles that players assemble prior to the beginning of play. Paper miniatures, representing both heroes and enemies, are placed on the board and moved on a turn-by-turn basis. Each turn allows players to carry out several actions including attacking, movement, and using items. Control of the enemy side is either done by a single player who chose not to have a hero, or by hero players on a rotating basis.&#10;&#10;Enemies in the game are grouped into three main factions: the primitive Ferans, slave-trading Ougluks, and the technologically advanced Warlock Industries. Each enemy, like the heroes, has a Stat card listing its attributes and default abilities/attacks. They do not, however, get additional Ability cards.&#10;&#10;",

The game is played by couples who are asked a series of questions with four alternative answers supplied. These questions cover topics ranging from sex to politics and the arts. Each partner decides on their favourite response and uses the electronic Perfect Match device to check their compatibility and advance along the board. the first couple to reach the Perfect Match Heart Light are the winners. Who will be your Perfect Match?&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;2 Electronic Perfect Match Devices.&#10;288 Question Cards.&#10;1 Die.&#10;4 Position Markers.&#10;Perfect Match Game Board.&#10;&#10;The players are divided into couples. Each couple takes a position marker and places it in the start square. Remove the perfect match cards from their perforations and place them in their marked positions on the game board.&#10;&#10;The Perfect Match Cards:&#10;These cards are divided into two categories: pink 'Girls' cards and blue 'Guys' cards. As the game proceeds, question cards are taken from the 'Girls' pile if the playing couple lands on a pink square or From the 'Guys' pile if they land on a blue square. Each card contains one questions with four alternative&#10;answers marked A,B,C or D.&#10;&#10;Choosing the right answer:&#10;If the couple lands on a blue square, one of the other players picks up a 'Guys' card and directs one question on it to the male partner. He must choose the alternative which he feels is most appropriate to him. His partner must try to anticipate his feelings or attitudes on that question and choose the same alternative. Couples should be open and honest in their choice of answer. Similarly, if the couple lands on a pink square, a 'Girls' card would be taken and its question directed towards the female partner. She will choose and answer and her partner should try to anticipate this response.&#10;&#10;Questions marked 'BOTH' are  designed to test compatibility, with each partner choosing their own favourite answer in response to the question asked.&#10;&#10;Using the Electronic Perfect Match device:&#10;These devices are in the shape of four hearts joined together. Each heart is labeled A,B,C or D, representing the four alternatives on the Perfect Match question cards. When a question is asked and each partner has silently decided on which alternative to choose, they each hold up their device with the chosen representative letter uppermost. They must not allow each other to see their choices. The two devices are then pressed together. If the electronic tone sounds, a perfect match has been achieved for that question.&#10;&#10;Dare Cards:&#10;Scattered throughout both packs of cards are Dare Cards. If one these cards appears, the couple must perform whatever is required of them according to the instructions on the card. Their performance is adequate (as indicated by a show of hands) then the couple may roll the die again and continue their turn. Be warned - if you are too easy on others then there is no challenge to perform well. If you are too tough, then your opponent will be equally tough on you. So be fair!&#10;&#10;Playing the game: Each couple rolls the die once and those with the highest score start, moving their marker the corresponding number of squares. One of the other players then reads the first question to the starting couple. If the couple achieves a Perfect Match, they roll the die again and advance the corresponding number of squares along the board. Remember, a couple can only roll the die and advance after  they have successfully answered a Perfect Match question or performed a Dare task. The couple continues in this way until they are unsuccessful in either a Perfect Match question or a Dare performance, in which case the control of the game is handed over to the next couple (moving clockwise).&#10;&#10;Winning the Game:&#10;The first couple to reach the Perfect Match Heart Light and then successfully achieve a Perfect Match from their Choice of either a Girls or Guys question will be declared the winner.&#10;&#10;&#10;    Special Note&#10;&#10;&#10;Should the electronic tone stop working use a nail file or a similar tool to lever apart the two case sections of the blue device. Carefully removed the battery, replacing it with one of identical type. Be sure to position it positive side up. When pressing the case sections back together, locate the letter &quot;A&quot; on the plastic cover over the battery position.&#10;&#10;Based on the formerly popular 1980s Network Ten (and much later Seven Network in 2002) Australian TV dating game show of the same name.&#10;&#10;",

The player then has ten seconds to study the picture on the card. When the timer runs out the card is passed to player two and player one rolls the die to see which question is to be asked. The questions are on the reverse of the picture card. Player Two checks the answer by looking at the picture and if it is correct the card is given back to Player One to keep. If the answer is wrong the card is placed back into the Brainbox and the next player chooses a card. Please remember, the answer to the question is on the picture side of the card, so look carefully! The player with the most cards after ten minutes wins! If there is a tie, it's sudden death with both players choosing a card and having to answer all eight questions on the card. The player who answers the most correctly wins! For 1 player Look at the card as above for ten seconds. Then turn the card over and answer all the questions (use a pen and paper to record the answers). If all questions are answered correctly the card is kept.

The first player takes a card from the Brainbox and turns the timer over. The player then has ten seconds to study the picture on the card. When the timer runs out the card is passed to player two and player one rolls the die to see which question is to be asked. The questions are on the reverse of the picture card. Player Two checks the answer by looking at the picture and if it is correct the card is given back to Player One to keep. If the answer is wrong the card is placed back into the Brainbox and the next player chooses a card. Please remember, the answer to the question is on the picture side of the card, so look carefully! The player with the most cards after ten minutes wins! If there is a tie, it's sudden death with both players choosing a card and having to answer all eight questions on the card. The player who answers the most correctly wins! For 1 player Look at the card as above for ten seconds. Then turn the card over and answer all the questions (use a pen and paper to record the answers). If all questions are answered correctly the card is kept. If any answers are incorrect, the card has to be put back in the Brainbox. See how many cards you have after five or ten minutes.&#10;&#10;",

Whenever a player gets a meeple on the bock, he gets a coin from the cash box and the meeple which previously occupied the bock, is eliminated from the game. Meeples which pass space 17 are also eliminated. Each player has 4 meeples. The player of the last meeple to occupy the bock, gets the rest of the coins in the cash box and wins the game. Meeples which get thrown out by other meeples can be brought back into the game again, if they are not thrown out by other meeples of the same color. If a meeple has passed the bock it can be brought back to the starting Point, if it gets on Space 13 or 17 (or is thrown out by an opposing meeple). The game was published in the 1930s and 40s.&#10;&#10;",

Players are divided into 2-4 teams and roll a special die each turn to determine which game they will play. These games include Counterfactuals, Fun with Flags, Sketch Charades, and Celebrity.&#10;&#10;In Counterfactuals, a member of the opposite team will draw a card that suppose a world that is different from our own in one key aspect, and asks a question about that world.  The competing teammates must choose from multiple-choice answers, and gain points if their answers match each other's, as well as if they match the game writers' answer.&#10;&#10;The goal in Fun with Flags is for a player to guess flags from a deck of cards based on clues given by a teammate.  The twist is that there are 3 Oops Words that the Clue-Giver cannot say.&#10;&#10;Sketch Charades is a simple drawing game, where one teammate will draw a card with a phrase, then has to draw it for another teammate to guess.&#10;&#10;Finally, Celebrity is a charades game, in which one teammate is chosen to be the Actor and all the other teammates are the Guessers.  An opposing team chooses answers for each of 5 categories for the Actor to act out.&#10;&#10;",

Mission cards range from housework chores (such as taking out the trash) to more complex activities such as organizing a weekend away. Each mission card also has a brownie point option that can be completed for extra points.&#10;&#10;Players can choose to discard any number of mission cards at the start of the game if they feel they cannot complete them. Different missions are worth a different number of points, and any uncompleted missions at the end of the week are worth negative points. If the other player guesses a mission you are attempting (or recently completed), then you gain no points for the mission.&#10;&#10;Strategy cards are mixed with the mission cards and allow players to change the rules of the game by making the other player discard missions, allowing some free guesses, or simply gaining points for a guessed mission.&#10;&#10;Players also draw five reward cards and choose the one they would most like to win. A players cards are keep secret from their opponent.&#10;&#10;The player with the most points at the end of the week earns a reward card to be used at their discretion.&#10;&#10;",

Each player secretly writes a four-digit number or four-letter word. The digits or letters must all be different. Players take turns trying to guess their opponent's number/word. The opponent tells them the number of matches.&#10;&#10;Right number, wrong place is a &quot;cow.&quot; Right number, right place is a &quot;bull.&quot;&#10;&#10;If the person who took the first turn is also the first to decode the secret number or word, the other person gets one more turn to see if they can tie.&#10;&#10;",

One player will play as Talibans, the other as a group of Polish soldiers who get ambushed by the Afghans.&#10;&#10;Before the game each player will pick several characters that will represent his forces. The goal of the game is to gain victory points by killing the opponents characters. Stronger characters will be of more use during the game but will also give the opponent more points once killed.&#10;&#10;The game lasts four rounds and each round last three phases:&#10;&#10;- Straighten + draw phase&#10;Each player straightens his characters so he can use them in the new round. Also each player draws cards until they have four cards in hand.&#10;&#10;- Action phase&#10;In the action phase players can perform actions until both of them decide to pass. For an action they can play a card from their hand (events or attachments), use an ability of a character or shoot using one of their characters. Each character can shoot once per action phase. &#10;When a character shoots players form an &quot;exchange fire&quot; pool by adding into it two &quot;miss&quot; cards and as many &quot;hit&quot; cards as is indicated on the shooting characters card. Now players can manipulate the &quot;exchange fire&quot; pool by playing cards that add either &quot;hit&quot; or &quot;miss&quot; cards. When both players don't want to play anymore cards they randomly pick one card from the pool. If it is a &quot;miss&quot; nothing happens, if it is a &quot;hit&quot;  the shot character loses one life point. If his life points are reduced to 0 he dies and victory points are awarded.&#10;&#10;- Discard phase&#10;Each player may discard one card from his hand.&#10;&#10;After the fourth round the player with the most victory points wins the game.&#10;&#10;If players own more than one copy of Warcard: Afganistan they can build their own decks before the game.&#10;&#10;",

Players need only reach the square adjoining the line for promotion--crossing it is not necessary.  Four squares of empty space at each corner of the board are called Towers and are not in the field of play.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to force an opponent's King into Checkmate.  Each player has his own colored set of standard Chess pieces, which move and capture the same as in ordinary Chess, but for a few variations related to this multiplayer adaptation, including an optional point system.&#10;&#10;",

If a tent reaches a space with an opposing tent, it's put over this tent and has captured it. Captured tents can be freed by the same maneuver. Freed and captured tents can be secured or released by taking them to one's base camp. Tents arriving at the gold claim at the center of the board get one goldnugget. For 3 nuggets a player can get a captured tent back.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The Pressman Are You Normal? Board Game asks questions that reveal funny and honest answers to see where you fit on the normal scale. For instance: Have you ever laughed so hard that something can out of your nose? 100 people were polled for each question to determine what is and what isn't considered normal. Guess and bet on answers to ramp up the fun while discovering where you and your friends land on the scale. Based on the short-lived 2012 OWN (Oprah Winfrey Network) TV game show Are You Normal, America? hosted by Barry Poznick and Kim Coles.&#10;&#10;Object:&#10;If 2 Players, be the first player to reach 20 points.&#10;&#10;If 3 Players, be the first player to reach 30 points.&#10;&#10;If 4 Players, be the first player to reach 40 points.&#10;&#10;If 5 players, be the first player to reach 50 points.&#10;&#10;If 6 Players, be the first player to reach 60 points.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;Game board, 200 question cards, 42 tokens, 12 voting cards (6 yes, 6 no), scorepad.&#10;&#10;Set Up:&#10;Each player takes the 7 tokens of the Yes/No color zero near them and one &quot;Yes&quot; and one &quot;No&quot; voting card of that same color. Mix the question cards and place them face down, in reaching distance of all players. One player takes the score sheet to keep track of all the players' scores.&#10;&#10;Playing:&#10;The player who claims to be the most &quot;NORMAL&quot; of the group starts the game. Then play moves clockwise. On your turn, read the top question card out loud. All players, including the player who read the card, place their &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; voting card face down in front of them based on their own personal experience: &quot;Yes&quot; if you have or &quot;No&quot; if you have not.&#10;&#10;Players now place one of their own tokens on the Yes/No section of all the other players, guessing whether each player said &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; to the action on the question. At the same time all players (except the reader) have to guess what percentage of people who were polled on the question card said &quot;Yes&quot; and place one of their tokens on the percentage circles in the middle of the board that they feel is correct. Starting with the player whose turn it is, reveal your answer and score the points, one for each correct guess for each player and two for each correct guess in the percentage area.&#10;&#10;During the game, players have one opportunity to &quot;Double Down&quot;, (i.e. place 2 tokens on one of the percentage circles in the middle of the board). After scores have been written, players take back their color tokens and the next player will be the reader.&#10;&#10;Ending and Winning the Game:&#10;Play continues until one player accumulates the required amount of points as outlined in the beginning of the rules. Now you will find out who actually is the most &quot;NORMAL&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

Players keep their penguins behind screens so that no one knows who has which colors.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player adds a penguin to the pyramid. The first penguins are placed in the bottom row (obviously), but once two penguins are adjacent, a penguin matching the color of either of those penguins can be placed on top of them; e.g., either a red or blue penguin can be placed on top of adjacent red and blue penguins. The bottom row can be no more than seven penguins long. If a player knocks down the pyramid, he takes penalty points equal to the number of penguins behind his screen, then players start again from scratch. When a player can't play &mdash; whether because he has no penguins at all or no penguins that can legally be played &mdash; he passes. Once all players pass, the round ends and everyone scores one penalty point for each of his unplayed penguins. Anyone who played all of his penguins returns two penalty points.&#10;&#10;After playing as many rounds as the number of players, the game ends and whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

Launch your discs into the tower and take down your opponent by being the first to sink four shots. For an even greater test of your speed and strategy, race to line up four discs in a row. You&rsquo;ll have a blast with this rapid game with two levels of difficulty, but there is only room for one champion in this head-to-head shootout.&#10;&#10;Bring it on!&#10;Get ready to test your skill and speed with this fast-paced version of the classic CONNECT 4 game.

Movement is based on drawing cards of two types: Oil Moving Cards and Pumping Station Cards. Oil Moving Cards are used to follow a longer, circuitous route, while the Pumping Station Cards use the Trans-Alaska Pipeline system that runs straight down the board for potential shortcuts. Oil Movement Cards can be drawn on any space of the board, while Pumping Station Cards may only be drawn on Pumping Station spaces.&#10;&#10;The 52 Oil Movement Cards contain 35 movement cards with values ranging from +1 to +10, 11 themed Go Back cards with values from -2 to -9, 3 themed No Move cards, 1 Go Back to Start card and 1 Advance token to Port Valdez card.&#10;&#10;There are 52 Pumping Station Cards, each displaying a pumping station numbered 1-12.  Pumping Station 1 is in Prudhoe Bay while Pumping Station 12 is in Port Valdez. When drawn, the player's barrel moves to that pumping station, even if that sends the barrel in the wrong direction.&#10;&#10;The first player to move all 4 barrels to their tanker is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Farmers are full of it, and are always trying to top each others' stories of what they have seen; some of it credible, and some of it less so.  You will attempt to weave the most credible UFO story!&#10;&#10;Mechanically, Pasture 51 is a stock (get it?) holding game, where players will decide which cattle they wish to hold while also deciding which cattle are legitimately abducted (adding to the credibility of the stories), which cattle simply pass away in the fields, and which cattle are involved in abduction hoaxes (which hurts the credibility of the stories).  There is one pasture card on the table for each of these outcomes, where cattle will graze before meeting their fate.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, he will draw two livestock tokens from a bag, with livestock coming in four varieties.  He will choose one to keep in his personal stock, and one to put below a pasture card of his choice.&#10;&#10;The backs of these tokens all contain special abilities as well.  When a token is put out into pasture, it is flipped into the air.  If it lands cattle-side up, too bad, no special ability.  If it lands ability-side up, the player will get to perform an ability such as moving a cattle to an adjacent pasture, swapping a cattle from his personal stock with one in the pastures, or witnessing an abduction, which moves a cattle token from grazing in the pasture up onto the pasture card, where it is locked for the rest of the game.  Abducting cattle while they are in the right pastures will be key to your success!&#10;&#10;After a set number of turns, players will determine the value of each cattle variety.  Cattle involved in hoaxes will decrease that variety's value, while those that were abducted by the real deal will add to it.  Players then compare their personal holdings against the value of each cattle variety, with most points weaving the most credible tale!&#10;&#10;",

Each turn you choose one of the following actions:&#10;&#10;1) Buy one fruit from a gardener&#10;2) Sell any number of fruits to customers&#10;3) Draw a card and adjust pricing in market&#10;4) Manage (swap) customer queue&#10;&#10;The player who makes the most money from trading wins !&#10;&#10;Most of the time when each player buys or sells any card, it will affect other players because the other players have to wait longer to buy or sell to get a decent price. And every game turn, there will be change in pricing which will cause each player to change their tactic dynamically otherwise player can lose opportunity to make money from trading efficiently.&#10;&#10;So there is no down time in the game because even during other player's turn, you must carefully watch out for change in pricing and decide on your own next tactic!&#10;&#10;It is designed for 2 - 5 players and end within 20 minutes. &#10;Fast and dynamically tactical game play.&#10;&#10;",

The game is, at its foundation, a strong game of rock/paper/scissors with the advantage of being able to mitigate and reverse engineer your opponent's capabilities. Assemblage of Eternity is built to give players who know everything about the game a huge advantage and, like its counterpart, a slim chance at losing against an opponent who just pushes buttons.&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game you'll find yourself learning your character, finding effective set-ups for their Ultras, and learning how to play them better. Some characters are harder to play than others, so the game includes set-ups, bios, and strategies to help new players, as well as suggested match-ups.&#10;&#10;",

However, even the best developers make mistakes, and therefor bugs do occur.&#10;&#10;Building up your software development factory helps you keep your processes under control. Or you can just hope to get away with your low quality product and heap all the misery on to your unsuspecting customer.&#10;&#10;Every player starts with a draw deck containing money, developer and epic cards, from which you draw a hand. During your turn, you can use cards to recruit new developers, special programming or testing tools, fix bugs, outsource or build towards completing your epics.&#10;&#10;When you complete an epic, you can hand it over to another player. The epic is tested for bugs. Bugs discovered during the test will cause damage to your epic or the other player's deck.&#10;&#10;Your final score is determined by the value of the epics you have successfully handed over, the bugs in your deck and being the first player to finish three epics.&#10;&#10;",

No speaking is allowed, so players have to hope their mime is good enough for the other person to get it.&#10;&#10;After doing the mime, the first player comes in and selects the next player to go out.  The person who received the mime the first time now has to mime it to the new player...and so on until all players have been outside.  The last player then comes back in and announces what they think is the answer.  Points are then scored and players move around the board until one reaches the finish line.&#10;&#10;",

In order to prove their devotion, they need to colonize new lands in the name of the king. They start building their headquarters &ndash; town &ndash; with just a handful of footman, and a few structures. Through the development of fortifications, buildings, researching new technologies, gathering resources and training recruits they can transform their colony into an impenetrable fortress. Alas, the new world is full of indigenous inhabitants who by any means possible try to get rid of unwanted colonizers. Countless hordes of barbarians, forest people, ferocious monsters and wolf men with their beasts and war machines will spare no effort to storm the town and its defenders.

        "description": "The Grasshopper &amp; the Ant is the fourth title in Purple Brain Games' &quot;Tales &amp; Games&quot; series, each of which comes packaged in a book-shaped box. In this game, players take turns playing the part of the industrious ants and the grasshopper content to sponge off the labor of the ants.&#10;&#10;The Grasshopper &amp; the Ant includes two ways to play, but the heart of both is the same. At the start of the game, lay out 16 (of the 48) path cards in a 4x4 grid; each path card shows one of four types of landscapes. The ant player places six ants on these cards, one ant per card, with the ants forming a chain (as in real life), then secretly chooses one type of terrain on which at least one ant stands. The grasshopper player then stands with one of the ants, and if the grasshopper chose the same landscape as the ant player, the grasshopper takes all the path cards of this type on which an ant stands; if the grasshopper chose incorrectly, then the ant player takes these path cards. Either way, you then refill the 4x4 grid. The ant player keeps playing until she finally wins path cards, then the next player in clockwise order controls the ants. (In winter mode, the third and fourth players control red ants and receive a random path card if they match the choice of the ant player.)&#10;&#10;In autumn mode, players score path cards immediately, with each type being tracked independently; path cards that feature insects are saved for a endgame bonus. As soon as a player maxes out two scoring tracks, the game ends and whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;In winter mode, players keep the path cards they collect in order to buy provision cards (worth one victory point), which cost particular combinations of path types. In this mode, when you win a path card that features an insect, you can claim another card in the grid that features the same insect. Collect both provision cards of the same type, and you score a bonus VP. The first player to collect 4 VPs wins.&#10;&#10;",

The remaining cards are placed in the center of the table forming a pile, facing down. This is the drawing deck.&#10;&#10;Rules&#10;&#10;Players take turns in order drawing a card from the drawing deck or the last discarded card (that's facing up next to the drawing deck) and discarding a card from their hand facing up on the discard pile afterwards.&#10;&#10;If the deck runs out, players should reshuffle the discard pile to make a new draw deck, leaving the last discarded card as a single-card discard deck.&#10;&#10;End game and aim:&#10;&#10;Two cards are said to be connected if they share 2 common characteristics and the third one is 'consecutive' (see above).&#10;&#10;Example: The 2 of Blue Suns is connected to the 2 of Blue Moons, but not to the 2 of Blue Arms.&#10;&#10;A player wins when, at the end of her turn, the cards in her hand form a chain of connected cards that links her two 'corner cards'.&#10;&#10;",

In the game, players take the role of Heaven's commanders who are tasked with gathering Angels, and deploying them to defeat Demons and claim Major Victories for Heaven. The goal of the game is to have the most Victory Points by the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The games contains 2 decks of cards, Infernal and Divine. to set up the game, players shuffle the Divine cards, deal out 4 cards to each player, and place the rest of the cards face down on the table to form the Divine deck. Next, players shuffle the Infernal cards together, place the Infernal cards face-down to form the Infernal deck for the game. Take the top 3 Infernal cards and place them face-up in a row on the table. This is the Center Row for the game. From here, the game plays in rounds with each player taking 1 turn in each round.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, they draw 1 Divine card from the deck and add it to their hand. Then, the player tries to defeat red Demon cards or claim purple Major Victory cards in the Center row by playing cards form their hand and matching the symbols on the Center Row cards. Any card played, defeated, or claimed goes to that player's Score pile. Once the player replaces any Center Row cards they took, it is the next player's turn.&#10;&#10;The game ends when there are no more Infernal cards to draw, no more Divine cards to draw, or 3 or more Major Victory cards have been claimed by players at the table. Players then discard all the cards in their hand, and total up the Victory Points on each card in their Score pile. The player with the most Victory Points wins.&#10;&#10;",

The leader's abilities alter vastly the strategy and playability of every other card in the deck, making the game playable in 25 different ways.&#10;&#10;In the game, players take turns placing cards and attacking. Each card can activate in various ways, taking on offensive capabilities in the front rows of the unit, or support powers in the back rows. Cards can also be played as orders &ndash; powerful single-time effects that can turn the tide of battle.&#10;&#10;Play continues until either player's leader is defeated.

        "description": "Based on the short-lived German game show of the same name that ran from 1991-1992 on SAT.1 for which in turn is based on the short-lived American game show Trump Card for which in turn was based on the British game show Bob's Full House.&#10;&#10;A player is host, the other playing against each other. Each player gets a bingo tablet which has the numbers 1-15. In the middle of the table, the chips come. There always three quizzes played. In the first round of quiz is about the four corner squares on the bingo tablet. Who could cover these fields with answer chip first, wins that round. The moderator asks a question from the question stack, the player who first gets &quot;BINGO&quot;, then may say the solution. If you are correct, he or she is allowed to occupy a corner with a chip, the answer is wrong, the player has to suspend for one round.  Once all questions have been asked a map, the next red card is drawn. Once all of the corner squared occupied, the winner gets 5 points credited, all the other players get as many pluses as they have covered chips. After the second game round begins. The chips from the first round, however, remain lying on the tablet. During the second round should you fill the middle of the first three rows of chips, also get all the players according to the number of chips on the tablet points in payroll. The winner will be credited 10 points this time. As the yellow question cards are taken. And here, the chips remain on the panel. In the third round, the game works gain similar to the previous one has here blue cards, the player must now cover all remaining fields with chips and the winner gets 20 points added to his or her account. Those who could collect the most points after all three rounds, may eventually challenge the Super Bingo round. If he or she wins the round, so doubled his/her score. Otherwise, they halved. We play with final game screen, which is a 5x5 large square with the number 1-25. Now the hourglass comes to train. The player has the task within 60 seconds to form a line of 5 fields with the chips either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. It is also worked here with the blue question cards. The player always calls the first field which he/she must prove with a chip, then reads the question before the host. If this answered correctly, a white chip is placed on the field, otherwise a black chip is placed. Now the player is called quickly to the next field on which he/she would place his/her stone.&#10;&#10;The game ends after 60 seconds. The winner is the player who can have the most points after all four rounds.&#10;&#10;",

Turns are alternate. The goal is to capture an opponent's cards using one of yours of lower rank, until you have the highest ranked card remaining.&#10;&#10;Captures are only valid if they take place in the same row or column as the card you want to use, the card-to-be-captured also must be of higher rank. For example, 2black can capture 5red, but 5red cannot capture 2black (or anything below a 6). A capture is performed by placing your card on your opponent's, and removing the captured card from the field.&#10;&#10;When no legal moves are possible, the person with the highest ranked card remaining wins the round, and earns the point value of the card. Kings are 13 points, Queens 12, Jacks 11. For example, if 8black and 5red remain, black wins and gets 8 points. If the round ends in a tie, then the person who made the last move wins. The game continues until someone gets 30 points.&#10;&#10;",

There was never a release with everything together.&#10;&#10;&#10;Based on the hit video game, Hawken! Grab a Mech and get to fighting&hellip; fast! Your deck of cards contains primary and secondary weapons systems, thrusters, special abilities, and various other high-tech instruments of war. Draw cards and place them onto the table as fast as you can, but be careful or you might overheat! If you don't wish to play a card, place it face down and it acts as cover for the round, absorbing a bit of damage from your opponent. The action is in real-time, but a game round ends when a player snags the FIRE! button from the center of the table. The speed of the Mechs are calculated, which determines the engagement range. Then weapons are fired and internal heat is generated. Quick reflexes are helpful, but a quick mind will win every time!&#10;&#10;",

Earn tokens by going out first and being named the Pumpkin King.&#10;&#10;The goal of Mischief Night is to get rid of all of your cards as fast as possible. The 92-card deck contains 78 monster cards ranked from 1 to 12, along with two Jokers (wild) and a Mischief Night X-deck of 12 cards.&#10;&#10;Each monster card bears a number, which is not only its rank, but also tells you how many of that card exist in the deck. There are twelve 12&rsquo;s, eleven 11&rsquo;s, ten 10&rsquo;s and so on, and a single card ranked #1 which is the Pumpkin King.  The lower the number, the better the rank. While the #12s are low ranking cards and the hardest to get rid of, they each have a unique ability that may be used during the Mischief Night part of play at the beginning of each round.&#10;&#10;In addition to the standard monster cards, there is another deck of twelve special (X) cards with different backs. This deck serves two purposes; it is used before the game starts to determine the starting player order and then 2 cards are earned each round by the player who earned Pumpkin King status.  During the Mischief Round they are very useful in battling the individual special powers of the #12 cards. The more rounds you win, the better chance you have of protecting yourself from the mischief.&#10;&#10;",

You have to concentrate on what you're trying to steal, what everyone else is going for, and what you've got left, not to mention what card just got played.&#10;&#10;",

The Government fell shortly after, and the many who had 'just in case' emergency plans, found themselves in isolation. Some lost their minds and others simply starved.&#10;&#10;The few of us that remain are left in a bleak and desolate landscape. Supplies are scarce and the enemy is strengthening, but we all share the will to survive. With what little hope remains, we band together and make our Last Stand.&#10;&#10;Last Stand is a cooperative survival simulation. Players will find themselves in a massive city with dwindling resources that is slowly being overrun with Infected. During the day, players can explore and take actions. They will have many opportunities to build bases, get supplies, assign survivors, fight and make use of special abilities. When Night falls, the Infected roam, but they are not the only threat. Starvation, sickness and the loss of humanity are a few of the other dangers that await.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Italy. Sometime in the 20&rsquo;s of the last century. The clans of different mafia families fight each other in... let&rsquo;s say - Naples!&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s all about honor, betrayal, contraband, theft! Every player is a member of one mafia family. However, it does not matter if you are a don or a henchman, a bookie or a snitch, a consigliere or a man of honour, nobody really has got a plan of what is going on. Who belongs to which family? Who wants to kill whom? Well, nobody knows, since there is only one code to follow: the code of silence - the OMERT&Agrave;!&#10;&#10;Omert&agrave; - Clan ohne Plan is a card game for 4 to 9 players where one can interact constantly: No waiting between turns! In fact, the game really takes place, when it&rsquo;s NOT your turn. Deal cards to your opponents and family members either in a rather clandestine way when nobody is looking or take a more straightforward approach - you decide. Each player then plays out the cards dealt to him when it&rsquo;s his turn &ndash; they can make him either richer or poorer, endanger his life or see the identities of other players. He may then choose whether to take three white cards (offensive), two black cards (defensive) or whether to try to bribe the other players. After that his turn ends and he can again start dealing cards and &quot;make them offers they can&rsquo;t refuse&quot;.&#10;&#10;Think tactically: Combine different action cards to manipulate and enhance effects!&#10;Cooperate: Bribe your opponents, help your don and get rid of the rest.&#10;Bluff: Every action is performed secretly. Nobody knows who you are or what you are up to...&#10;Change the game: Everyone is playing a different character, for example a consigliere or the bookie. Choose the combination of characters handed out beforehand to change the game entirely!&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, you hold one of your cards capital side-out toward your left-hand opponent. If he can name one of the countries adjacent to the depicted country, he claims the card; if not, the next opponent in clockwise order can try to do so. Remove the card from the game if no one guesses correctly.&#10;&#10;In the third game, deal ten cards capital side-up to each player. On a turn, choose two cards and hold them out to your left-hand opponent. If he can guess which country is larger in size or population (depending on what choose at the start of play), he claims both cards; otherwise, remove the card from the game.&#10;&#10;",
