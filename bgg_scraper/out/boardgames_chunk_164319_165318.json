The players can play several scenarios, or play out the full time framed. &#10;The game system is focused at the operational level commander, but the use of many rules features brings a high level of &lsquo;tactical&rsquo; effects into consideration without creating a high level complexity for the players.&#10;The combat system especially is designed to reduce mathematics and speed play, both for ground forces, and with the &lsquo;no die roll&rsquo; air-to-air and antiaircraft system for the aviation actions.&#10;&#10;The OCMS is designed to be a constant rule, constant rating system that can link together all games in a series to allow for strategic levels of actions, this in effect is the linking of various theaters so the actions and outcomes in one  theater can show impact in others.&#10;&#10;The OCMS does this by having a solid core of rules (24 pages) that is standard for all the games in each series. In the end, the World War II series will allow players to make transfers of forces not only inside theaters, but globally, for example divisions can be transferred from Europe to the Pacific (or in the other direction) as all units are consistently rated for movement, and combat.&#10;&#10;",

Recent advances in space travel now make it possible to leap to and from these galaxies in minutes.&#10;&#10;Now, Earth&rsquo;s pizza corporations are in a race to become the most well known pizza franchise in the universe.&#10;&#10;Publisher's Description:&#10;&#10;Winning the Game: In Solar Slice, each player assumes the role of a Pizza Corporation. At the end of the game, the corporation with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Game: A game consists of 4 rounds.&#10;&#10;Round: Each round consists of 4 phases: Galaxy Prime, Marketing, Delivery, and Scoring.&#10;&#10;During the Galaxy Prime Phase a launch card is revealed which establishes both the Galaxy Prime (the trump color), and the Scoring values of each galaxy for the round.&#10;&#10;During the Marketing Phase players place a Marketing Ring onto the board in any galaxy they choose. This helps to protect their interests in that galaxy from sabotage.&#10;&#10;During the Delivery Phase, players make a total of 10 Deliveries. A Delivery consists of each player playing 1 card from their hand The winner of each Delivery advances their pawn in a galaxy of their choosing.  Players win deliveries by either playing the highest numbered card of a starting color, or the highest Galaxy Prime card. Any sabotage cards played during the Delivery decrease  a chosen player's advancement in a particular galaxy.&#10;&#10;During the Scoring Phase, players advance their pawns on the score track according to the values listed on the Launch Card associated with the round.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In 7 Kingdoms, players are royal agents who want to collect as many followers as possible. Whoever does this best will win the game.&#10;&#10;The deck in 7 Kingdoms consists of 49 cards in seven types, with each type having seven cards in a particular number range: king (1-7), bishop (8-14), etc. up to peasant (43-49). Each number range has seven cards in it, with each being a different color and bearing a crest of that color. Each player starts with three cards in hand, and one crest card of each type is laid in a row, with one card placed face up next to each crest.&#10;&#10;Each round, players take turn laying one card face up in front of them, then they resolve the cards from high to low. Whoever played the highest card places it on the opposite side of the leftmost crest card, then takes 1-4 cards from those on display next to the crests as determined by the power of the card played. Then the player with the next highest card goes, etc. Any cards unclaimed are placed to the right of played cards, then the row is filled with cards from the deck until seven cards are on display once again.&#10;&#10;With each card claimed, the player can either add it to his hand (up to a maximum of three cards in hand) or place it in his scoring pile. Kings, for example, let you take any four cards on display, while generals let you take cards from three consecutive spaces, princesses let you take any two cards, and peasants let you take one of two cards from specific spaces. Thus, the low cards let you claim first, but put more restrictions on what you claim or have you claim fewer cards. The bishop scores himself, then let you place one of two bonus tokens on the leftmost crest card, reveal another bonus token, then claim one card.&#10;&#10;When the deck runs out or each crest card has a bonus token, the game ends and players score any cards remaining in hand. Each card claimed is worth 1 point (except for kings, which are worth 2), and whoever has the most cards of a crest claims the bonus token on that crest, thereby earning bonus points or doubling his score.&#10;&#10;",

The Player must gather his Nobles and their forces in order to take control of Cities and Towns.

For this, players need to recruit the most unlikely and exotic characters to help them in a &quot;ferocious&quot; battle, including the Alien, the T-Rex and the Super Human Bomb.&#10;&#10;During the game, players share a deck of cards and alternate turns choosing between drawing more cards or playing the ones in their hands. Each turn, players can also activate their characters in play to find muffins or attack characters, using dice to determine the outcome of each action.&#10;&#10;Each card represents a character, which has two values: Life and Power. The Life value represents how much damage the character can take before dying, and also how many dies the characters uses when finding muffins or attacking other characters.&#10;The Power value determines how difficult it is to find a muffin or to cause damage to a target. Furthermore, each character has an unique ability that affects the game in many different ways.&#10;&#10;",

The other players, in any order, try to say &quot;First (werewolf howl)&quot;, &quot;Second (werewolf howl)&quot;, etc., but they can't say something at the same time as another player; if they do, or if someone says that wrong thing, then the round ends and those magicians receive a curse token worth -1 point.&#10;&#10;As magicians answer correctly, they throw their magic spell cards into the box in the center of the table. Once the round ends, in the order that they threw their cards in the box they claim one ingredient from a stack, revealing the next ingredient if they took a face-up tile. If someone reveals a curse tile, then she must take that, too.&#10;&#10;When two stacks are empty or all of the curse tokens have been taken, the game ends. Players then score 3, 7 or 10 points for their completed potions (which take 3-5 ingredients), 1 point for each magic potion, and -1 for each curse (with an additional -4 points for whoever has the most). Whoever has the high score wins.&#10;&#10;",

Shuffle the deck and deal it out facedown to all players.&#10;&#10;Each player takes his deck in hand, and on a turn she says the next note in the scale while revealing a card and slapping it on the table (ideally revealing the card away from her). Thus, the first players says &quot;Do&quot; and reveals, the next player &quot;Re&quot; and reveals, etc. If the note being said matches the card being revealed, players must race to slap the card stack, with the last player to do so gaining all of the cards. When a keyboard is revealed, everyone must slap, regardless of the note. With &quot;Stereo&quot;, the two players on the immediate right and left of the player must slap, regardless of the note. Once a &quot;Mute&quot; has been played, everyone must quietly track the notes in their hand and slap the stack at the right time.&#10;&#10;If you slap the card stack at the wrong time, you must take all of the cards, with the next player starting again with &quot;Do&quot;.

At the start of a round, each player receives a hand of six cards. In the first round, each player simultaneously reveals a card and places it in the center of play. For rounds #2-4, players then do the following: Simultaneously reveal one card from their hand, take turns claiming one card from the center of play in food chain order (tigers, wolves, raccoons, snakes, frogs, butterflies, with more animals of the same type beating fewer), then they all place their cards in the center of the table.&#10;&#10;After each has claimed three cards, they use their final two cards in hand to try to make poker combinations using either animal type, number of animals, or card color. Players score 1 point for a single pair up to 15 points for a five-of-a-kind. The best combination earns 3 bonus points, and each butterfly card is worth 1 extra point. If someone has reached fifty points, the game ends and this player wins; otherwise shuffle the deck for a new round.&#10;&#10;",

Sit yourself down for a fast and furious game of zombie dominance!&#10;&#10;In this game each player takes the role of a shambling and hungry zombie, trying their best to get to the front of the zombie horde where they&rsquo;ll have the best chance at a juicy bite from one of those still living. Each zombie player will do their best to rid themselves of other nearby zombies (game cards) by pushing them back or foisting them onto other zombie players.&#10;&#10;The first player to break away from the horde by discarding all of their cards wins! Play begins with the player to the left of the dealer. That player must play one card into a central pile. This card will be one of four suits: Hearts, Splatters, Biohazards or Palms. This card determines which suit will be the active suit. The first player ends their turn by drawing cards from their draw pile until they have 5 cards in their hand.&#10;&#10;If a player cannot play a card of the same suit as the active suit, they must pick up all of the cards in the central pile and place them on the bottom of their draw pile, ending their turn.&#10;&#10;Each card has also has a number on it. If a player has 2, 3 or 4 of a kind, which includes a card with the active suite, they may play all of these cards. The card with the active suit must be played last so that the active suit is still the top card on the central pile.&#10;&#10;If a player ever has all 5 cards in their hand with the same suit (i.e. all biohazard), on their turn they may place all five cards on the central pile and then draw five cards (if possible) into their hand.&#10;&#10;The first player to discard all of their cards in their draw pile and hand has successfully outdistanced the horde and wins! Watch out for Infected cards though, they're hard to get rid of!&#10;&#10;Zombies: Infection: Each deck of Zombies: Shambling and Hungry comes with 20 Infected cards. They are used to infect your friends, who in turn can and should infect other friends! Use as many Infected cards as there are players. One person becomes Patient Zero, and starts off with 8 Infected cards. They then try to infect others! A the start of the game, only Patient Zero can infect other players. All players should agree on a time limit for the game &ndash; it can be an hour or until the end of an event&#10;&#10;",

Send your minions around the globe to execute nefarious plots such as marketing evil soda, hijacking a nuclear submarine, building a time portal, or ruining a beloved movie property. Each turn you&rsquo;ll send your minions to exotic locales such as London, Cairo, Machu Picchu, or Antarctica to gather the resources you need to carry out your plans: Finance, Occult, Science, and of course Unobtainium. Watch out for your opponents&mdash;they&rsquo;re trying to pull off their own schemes. Each sinister plot you execute is but one small part of your secret Ultimate Scheme!&#10;&#10;A game turn consists of five steps: draw new schemes, move minions (perform twice), collect resources (perform twice), execute schemes, and the end step. Players perform each step in play order, so if Player 1 collects the resources in Cairo, Player 2 can't get Cairo's resources that turn. During the course of the turn, players move their minions to sites and collect the resources each site provides. Then they pay resources to execute schemes held in their hand, and earn progress points toward victory by doing so. To execute a scheme, a player must meet the scheme resource cost, and have a minion located in the scheme's site (for example, to subvert the U.N., a player must have a minion in New York). Action cards give players special advantages in moving minions, collecting resources, gaining new minions, or destroying enemy minions. The &quot;first player&quot; rotates each turn.&#10;&#10;Each player begins the game with a secret &quot;Ultimate Scheme&quot; card such as Ruin Christmas or Destroy Rock 'n' Roll. The Ultimate Scheme card dictates how many progress points the player needs to win, and what *kind* of schemes he or she needs to pull off. The game ends at the end of the turn in which the first player to complete his or her Ultimate Scheme does so. If multiple players finish their Ultimate Scheme on the same turn, various tiebreakers determine victory -- but the easiest way to win is to be the first villain to pull off your grand plan.&#10;&#10;",

The game primarily involves bluffing, resource management, and tactical positioning.&#10;&#10;Way of the Fighter: SUPER includes five fighters: Ren, Jun, El Falcon, Alberdus, and Aurelia. Players can build their deck from multiple card techniques, allowing them to customize their favorite fighter to fit a play style that best suits them. Combining Way of the Fighter Super with Way of the Fighter Turbo allows you to tag in two more players for even more action.&#10;&#10;Over a period of twelve intense turns, each player will control a fighter&rsquo;s movement, manage the fighter&rsquo;s energy, and decide on what actions to have the fighter perform against the opposing challenger. The game continues until one fighter is knocked out, or the time runs out; at which point one fighter will be declared the Champion!&#10;&#10;",

The moonlight casts a pale light over the battleground as you compete with your team, earn experience, gain skills, and battle rival ninja clans in this league/campaign style game.&#10;&#10;Featuring world class Chibi style sculpts from the world famous Soda Pop Miniatures team (makers of Super Dungeon Explore), expect fun and whimsical game play to be married with fantastic and unique style and fun.&#10;&#10;Ninja All Stars allows for 2 to 4 players to take control of a team of ninja (this may be a pre-rolled team or a team purchased with points) and battle over objectives.  Each Ninja Clan is drawn from a different element (6 in total), with each element providing different bonuses in-game.  As well, the game's dice mechanic is based on the element system, using a rock-paper-scissors type of dice elimination to determine the outcome of various aspects such as combat, searching, and special abilities.  It is important to note that combat is not a simple &quot;I rolled more swords than your shields&quot;; the elimination of dice will give the winner a choice of different combat results based on the remaining dice.  The interesting point here is, ninja don't die in this game-rather,they are knocked out and placed in their team's dojo, where they rest and recover and may eventually be brought back onto the board.  The rules allow for one-off scenario games as well as league play with guidelines on ninja advancement, meaning that players can develop their ninja over many games.&#10;&#10;The game comes complete with enough miniatures to allow for 4 teams, each of a different element, the game board, and numerous tokens for game effects.&#10;&#10;",

Or were they? 16 card Carrier Strike portrays the essence of carrier battles in a simple format requiring cards, dice, markers and a playing area to represent the ocean.&#10;&#10;In Carrier Strike you will be in command of a group of 2 carriers and up to 4 squadrons of combat aircraft, represented by cards and dice. Using your skills in reconnaissance, timing and manoeuvre, you attempt to defend your own carriers while sinking your opponent's. Combat uses cards to select an 'aggression stance' that will help to determine losses and whether you can drive off enemy aircraft. The basic game uses only 16 cards, some dice and markers.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "True to Life Baseball is a dice/board game that accurately simulates all the drama of a real baseball game. In extensive testing the average team runs and hits were within 3% of actual game stats. TTL Baseball comes with 6 teams from the 2011 season. Each team has 23 players printed on 3 separate 8 1/2&quot; x 11&quot; card stock ivory paper. The player sheets come in 3 hole punched sheet protectors that make the game easily transportable in a standard binder. (binder is not included)&#10;&#10;The game has 4 different player modes; intro, basic, advanced, and 'Ultra Simulation Mode' which consists of using the advanced version along with all optional rules. After familiarity with the rule set, average game times range from 20 minutes for intro games to 40 minutes for advanced games. USM games would take a bit longer.&#10;&#10;The game is for 1 to 2 players and is highly suitable for solitaire play. TTL Baseball has over 1800 hours in development. The advanced game was designed first, then to shorten average game times a simpler pitching system was designed for the basic game. Finally, the intro game is a simplified version to allow players to start playing games without knowing all the advanced rules.&#10;&#10;Think you could have managed a team to a better season record than the actual manager did? Now you have the opportunity. Play a single series or an entire season with season player stat sheets available separately. In addition, extra player sheets are available for most seasons that add an additional 4 players to every team. This would bring each teams roster to 27 players.&#10;&#10;This game features base stealing, squeeze plays, maximum pitch counts, pitch guessing, defensive depth adjustments for infield and outfield. The advanced games pitching system is perhaps the most accurate available. Optional rules limit use on how often each pitcher may be used within any 5 game period. Bullpen managements are included to keep track of pitcher use. There are also ballpark ratings that make parks either allow more or less home runs just as in reality. A rare play table accounts for almost every possible play possible in baseball. ie. triple plays, double steals, power outages, rain delays leading to arm stiffness for starting pitchers, outfielders colliding....etc.&#10;&#10;TTLB uses a unique pitching check mechanic that uses a separate roll on 50% of key batting outcomes. This 'Pitcher Check Roll' (PCR) ensures that both hitter and pitcher attributes are taken into account. This makes both pitchers ERA's and hitters BA's as accurate as possible.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The game's full name is &quot;Hogen No Ran: Hogen Gannen (1156) (&#228;&#191;&#157;&#229;&#133;&#131;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#185;&#177;&#239;&#188;&#154;&#228;&#191;&#157;&#229;&#133;&#131;&#229;&#133;&#131;&#229;&#185;&#180;&#227;&#128;&#128;(1156), Hogen Disturbance: First Year Of Hogen 1156)&quot;. This doujinshi (self-published work) is a simulation of the 1156 battle in Heiankyo (modern day Kyoto), Japan, between feuding factions of the Fujiwara family of kuge (nobles) fighting over who would hold the position of Tenno (Emperor).&#10;&#10;Without getting too deeply into the complex web of politics surrounding the battle, the sitting Tenno Go-Shirakawa was involved in an ongoing succession battle with his half-brother Sutoku (the retired Tenno). Sutoku had been forced out by his father Toba years earlier in favor of another son (Konoe), and when Konoe died, Sutoku saw this as his chance to install his own son as Tenno. However, Toba insisted on installing another of his sons, Go-Shirakawa. When Toba eventually died, Sutoku took advantage of his death to plot with supporters to force Go-Shirakawa from the throne. As if this doesn't sound messy enough already, Go-Shirakawa and Sutoku both had supporters among the three major families of the day-the Fujiwara, Taira, and Minamoto. Supporting Go-Shirakawa was Fujiwara no Tadamichi, Taira no Kiyomori, and Minamoto no Yoshitomo. Supporting Sutoku was Fujiwara no Yorinaga, Taira no Tadamasa, and Minamoto no Tameyoshi.&#10;&#10;Historically the fighting took place mainly on July 28-29. Minamoto no Tametomo (a Sutoku supporter) suggested a night attack, but was unwisely overruled by Fujiwara no Yorinaga. Instead, the next evening, Minamoto no Yoshitomo and Taira no Kiyomori led a night attack of their own on Sutoku's palace. Despite being frustrated in their initial attacks on the west gate by the incredible archery prowess of Minamoto no Tametomo, Yoshitomo and Kiyomori simply broke off the attack, moved to other gates, and torched the palace, circumventing that whole messy combat thing. Sutoku was exiled and most of his allies were killed in battle or executed. On the winning side, rewards were handed out, but what was seen as an uneven distribution by the Minamoto resulted in another conflict (the Heiji no Ran) three years later.&#10;&#10;Hogen No Ran shares its game system with its follow-up, Heiji No Ran. The game runs for 11 turns, taking the action from the tenth day of the seventh month in the first year of Hogen to the 13th day (July 28-31, 1156, two turns per day with a night turn). Forces of the various factions are individual leaders with associated clansmen, rated for both troop strength and leader ability. Chrome rules put an emphasis on the favored tactics of the day, mainly the use of fire to flush out the enemy. There are also special rules for night attacks, allowing players to see if Minamoto no Tametomo's strategy would have brought victory to Sutoku. Victory is determined by unit losses and possession of the Emperor/retired Emperor. Counter numbers are low, the game system is clean and well thought out, and it does an excellent job of simulating the battle as it was recorded in the Hogen Monogatari (a gunkimono-'war tale'-written around the year 1200).&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Characteristics&#10;&#10;The essential idea behind the development of this game was to create a mechanism that would allow literally infinite possibilities of development, always keeping the maximum simplicity of the game, while keeping to the minimum the dimensions of the board. Ie not wanted to achieve a very large number of possibilities via increasing dimensions of the board, but actually achieve infinite number of possibilities with finite dimensions. I am aware that the property of &quot;infinite possibilities&quot; does not necessarily imply a high degree of complexity. Analyzing the subject I found that a way to achieve endless possibilities in a space of finite dimensions is eliminating the mechanics of boxes and introducing another type of metrics.&#10;I was essentially inspired by the game of chinese origin here known as &quot;GO&quot; which is characterized by extremely simple rules and at the same time maintaining a high degree of complexity. The dynamics of this game is quite similar to the GO, share many aspects, and in fact the purpose is similar, and yet at the same time, they also differ substantially in many aspects. This will be understood by analyzing the rules of the game.&#10;The rules were analyzed consistently with certain typical aspects of war.&#10;Another parameter of design was to attempt to emulate, if not increase, the intrinsic characteristic of the GO of being a chaotic and stochastic game.&#10;&#10;The name of the game derives from the Latin expression for the word &quot;dominion / control&quot;.&#10;&#10;Equipment&#10;&#10;Pieces&#10;The pieces are circular, with a thickness that allows its easy handling. These pieces are characterized in that each has a range (a circular area whose diameter is three times the diameter of the piece). Each piece has one side painted white and the other black (like in Othello), and each player may chose one side (color) to play. Both sides have in the center a gray circle (its just decorative), whose diameter is equal to a quarter of the pieces' diameter. &#10;To tell if a piece is within the range of another, just take a piece and place it over the two pieces. If the piece used to measure is supported by the two pieces, one can ensure that a piece is within the range of the other (and vice versa).&#10;    As in the GO, it is assumed that virtually there is an infinite supply of pieces.&#10;&#10;Board&#10;    The board has two concentric squares: the peripheral (whose side is equal to 20x the diameter of the pieces) and the central (whose side is equal to 14x the diameter of the pieces). The peripheral defines the playing area, and the central only serves as a visual reference to place the pieces.&#10;&#10;Rules&#10;&#10;&#10;    Start: At the start of the game the board is empty. Black plays first. Then both players play alternately. In his turn, a player must make appear a piece in an empty space on the board.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Disappearance: A piece disappears when it is within the range of four or more opponents pieces.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    End: When a player makes a &quot;suicide&quot; move, the game ends and that player loses. If the game comes to a point where that may never happen, then it's a tie.&#10;&#10;&#10;Notes about the terms used:&#10;&#10;Note 1: it is said that a player makes a &quot;suicide&quot; move when he makes appear a piece in a place where it is within the range of four or more opponents pieces, and since this move does not make opponent pieces disappear (then, only that piece disappears, by the rule of disappearance).&#10;Note 2: it is said that a player makes a &quot;sacrifice&quot; move when he makes appear a piece in a place where it is within the range of four or more opponents pieces, and since this move makes one or more opponent pieces disappear (then, that piece and the respective opponent pieces disappears, by the rule of disappearance).&#10;&#10;",

By acquiring the resources for manuscript illustration and reproduction, your abbey produces and sells its valuable works, thereby bringing in finances necessary for maintaining a fine abbey. Will you succeed in making your abbey the most prestigious of all?&#10;&#10;Biblios Dice is a revision of Scripts and Scribes: The Dice Game, which is itself a dice version of Biblios (originally called Scripts and Scribes).&#10;&#10;The object is to acquire gold and to collect resources &ndash; scrolls, manuscripts, pigments, quills, ink &ndash; to exchange for gold. It follows the same basic theme as Biblios, but with interesting changes due to the use of dice. As in Scripts and Scribes, players compete in five different categories, and the values of the categories change during the game. In addition, depending upon the dice roll, there may be many or few auctions during the game in which players auction their resources for gold or auction gold for resources.&#10;&#10;Biblios Dice differs from its earlier version Scripts and Scribes: The Dice Game in a few important ways. Regarding the production and components, Biblios Dice has much nicer artwork, the game board has been divided into separate boards, and the resource dice are etched. Regarding the rules, Biblios Dice has a few important changes.  The goal of the game is now to collect the most VPs, rather than gold. There is only one type of auction in this game, and the first and second place winners of the auction get dice (not winner take all). The auctions also do not happen as randomly, but can be predicted based upon the progress of the mule on the market board.&#10;&#10;",

At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt a hand of six cards. Each player now takes turns, playing one card on the 3x3 grid on the table and replenishing back to six. The crucial thing is that you can play your card on top of your opponent's card on the grid as long as the number on your card is higher than the existing number on grid. The Wild card counts as the highest number when you play, the lowest when it is already on the table.&#10;&#10;Whenever you make a three in a row with your played cards, you score 1.

They try to survive by exploring the island and collecting provisions, with each team doing their best to outsmart their rivals. The teams face off in exciting elimination challenges. After the tribes have merged it&rsquo;s every player for himself. Players individually vote for those tribe members with whom they&rsquo;ll try to keep going as long as possible. Will you survive this bloodcurdling knock-out race? Who among you is the true Survivor?&#10;&#10;Goal of the game:&#10;The player who, after the Merge, has cast the most votes for the last standing tribe member wins Expeditie Robinson.&#10;&#10;Game-play:&#10;Expeditie Robinson is played in 2 phases:&#10;1. The Team Phase (2 islands)&#10;2. The Merge (1 island, every man for himself)&#10;&#10;The Team Phase (2 islands)&#10;Each team tries to accomplish 3 different missions before the Team Phase ends.&#10;&#10;With each of the three missions the teams can earn an extra voting card to be used in the next phase.&#10;&#10;The 3 missions&#10;&deg; Have more tribe members (pawns) than the opposing team.&#10;&deg; Have &ldquo;explored&rdquo; (turned over) more island tiles than the opposing team. &#10;&deg; Have more provisions left than the opposing team.&#10;&#10;The teams take turns. A turn consists of two action points. There are two different actions, each costing one action point.&#10;&#10;&deg; Choosing an island tile&#10;Choose one tile from the four stacks in the middle of the table and join it to the island.&#10;&#10;&deg; Moving a tribe member&#10;Move a team member by one tile. It doesn't matter if the tile has been explored already. by doing this you can explore the tiles you've added and find provisions. With these provisions you can feed your tribe members and build tools.&#10;&#10;During a turn a team can perform every possible combination of these two actions. As well as actions, you are always allowed to make a campfire and tools without the cost of action points.&#10;&#10;Elimination challenge&#10;Whenever the 'Elimination challenge' tile has been revealed the challenge is played. The teams each take their own sets of dice and take turns. They must try to build a tower of six dice, with &ldquo;6&rdquo; at the bottom, followed by &ldquo;5&rdquo;, then &ldquo;4&rdquo;, then &ldquo;3&rdquo;, then &ldquo;2&rdquo;, and finally &ldquo;1&rdquo; on top. The first player to succeed wins.&#10;&#10;The Merge (1 island, every man for himself)&#10;Players now play on individually; teams no longer exist. Each player receive voting cards for 4 votes, 2 votes. Players that belonging to the team that won a mission during the Team Phase gets 1 extra vote for every mission they won.&#10; Voting&#10;Players cast their votes in secret. Putting every voting card they possess into a slot in the voting tray. &#10;On the voting tray each slot has its own color. These colors represent tribe members. Casting a vote into the red slot means voting for the red tribe member. Of course you will do what you can for your chosen tribe member to be the last one standing.&#10;&#10;The knock-out race begins&#10;Just as in the Team Phase, a player playing his turn has the two same action points and actions that can be used.&#10;&#10;The players try to find food for the tribe member they voted for so they stay in the game. But not to obvious, otherwise they might get discovered and thrown out by other players.&#10;&#10;One by one the tribe members will get eliminated. The game will continue this way until there&rsquo;s only one tribe member left. This is the last standing tribe member, in other words, the true Survivor.&#10;&#10;Now the time has come for an exciting moment &minus; who voted for this tribe member and how many votes did he cast? The player to have cast the most votes for the Survivor, is the winner!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "An elegant game based off the traditional gambling game of the fierce and reclusive konog species, a secretive and xenophobic race from a remote corner of the galaxy. This game, enjoyed for years by the expeditionaries and pioneers in the Industrial Sectors, has only recently been introduced to the Core Systems.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to make a number of &quot;Konogs&quot;; which is either three cards of the same number of any suit, or a run (1, 2, 3) of three cards of the same suit. After playing a Konog, the fourth card left in your hand is placed in front of you, this is the value of that Konog. At the end of the game (after one player has performed a sixth Konog and all other players have taken one last turn) these values are added together (plus any triumvirates) to find the player's total ending score. The player with the highest score is the winner.&#10;&#10;Note: you will need a large plate (or a rotating tray, like a Lazy Susan) to play Konog. As a player discards, many cards will make the discard piles (one for each player) rotate in different directions. Also included in the game are wooden &quot;sentries&quot;, you can place these on a discard pile to protect a card from being taken or covered up by another player.&#10;&#10;Konog has many features that set it apart from other games. Inside each game box you can expect to find: simple, yet elegant artwork featured on circular cards, a completely alien numerical system based on three (don't worry, standard numbers are featured at the bottom of each card for those that are unfamiliar with the Konog numeral system), colorful wooden pieces (a sentry and matching post for each player), and a drawstring bag to hold everything.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The Expansive Hospital is a board game in which players collaborate and compete to build a hospital with plastic blocks. Players have to build and treat patients at the same time, since the hospital is under constant expansion. There are many different kinds of patients and plastic blocks necessary to treat them. Designing the blocks is difficult because each player is responsible for one aspect of it: architect, engineer, contractor, nurse, facility manager or director. A poor design allows for earning more money but contributes to the hospital bankruptcy, in which case everybody loses the game. The gist of the game is to find a balance between the need to join forces and the greed for money.&#10;&#10;The game design is based on a research conducted with three healthcare construction projects in the Netherlands commissioned by Pioneering. The research found that hospital design is often over schedule due to the conflicts of interests between the multiple parties involved. The game reproduces some of these conflicts, such as the engineer wanting to build more pipes than needed whiles the architect wanting to build a high rise building. If the conflict is not resolved between the players, patient satisfaction drops, together with the hospital income. Playing the game is an opportunity to learn the importance and the difficulties of designing for healthcare performance while having fun with the artificial conflict enactment.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Grow: The Organic Building Game is a three-dimensional building game in which 2-4 players guide the constant growth of a tree and compete by blossoming flowers around it. The game features a simple-to-learn set of rules, ideal for younger children, while offering a deep level of strategic nuance for more seasoned players. The core mechanisms have been designed to lightly simulate the life of an actual tree, complete with seasons, flowering, and even bugs! Players are given the ability to grow the board, or tree, in any way they choose &ndash; resulting in a unique and interesting play experience every time. The game's length is completely adjustable and can be set up to last anywhere between 20-60 minutes.&#10;&#10;Each player is represented by a flower color. The goal of the game is to have the most point-worthy flowers of your chosen color before the seasons &mdash; represented by stacks of leaves &mdash; run out. To do this, you perform one of three simple actions: place a bud which will blossom into a complete flower the next turn, place a leaf to help guide the tree's growth, or use a beetle to attack or protect flowers. Since flowers can connect only to leaves, and leaves can connect together to form chains, points are determined by how many leaves each flower is from the nearest branch. The game also features several unique, seasonal events that can be very beneficial or harmful to the tree's growth including locusts swarm, bee pollination, and wood rot!&#10;&#10;Grow: The Organic Building Game was created by Tap Pribbenow, Chris Hassebrook and Kyle Bromley on the idea of blending traditional sculpture with tabletop gaming, while providing a fun way of incorporating plant ecology.&#10;&#10;",

Players attempt to play a single card, or a set of cards, each one must succeed the prior one played with a higher value, or greater amount of cards.  Players then score points based upon how long of a run their last play was, with points lost for cards left in hands.  Players also have jokers that act as wild cards, used to complete the going out in a single run.&#10;&#10;The solitaire version works like the 2 player version, but a player plays both sides.&#10;&#10;There is also a competitive version that utilizes the same drafting mechanism, but tweaks how cards are played.&#10;&#10;",

The giants are large stand-up boards with punch-out circles representing hits to the head, torso, arm, or feet.&#10;&#10;Tokens are shaken in a cup and placed in a pool on the table. One side of the tokens is a color matching each player with a number, and the other side has a magic, weapon, or gold symbol. Players draft tokens  With the gold they hire their army, with the magic they fuel their wizards, and with the weapon they activate their fighters. Once a giant is hit, the striking player gets the punch token. When a giant is dead, players roll dice, based on their punch tokens, for victory points or more fuel tokens. If the numbers showing on the tokens when they come out of the cup equal 7 for any particular player, that player has a troop killed in combat.&#10;&#10;",

You can't afford to be the weak link in this chain!&#10;&#10;McJohny's is an action-packed party game for 3 to 6 players that takes about 20 minutes. The game is comprised of different mini-games. Each shift, one player is the manager and decides who has to do what. Together they try to satisfy some of the four customers that come to the restaurant. Employees are allowed to work only one minute because of very strong unions. Also due to the low budget, there aren't always wages for everyone, so not all of the staff wants to cooperate.&#10;&#10;In the end you count up your acquired little crabs &mdash; the only currency usable at McJohny's &mdash; and trade them in at the restaurant gift shop. Maybe you'll earn enough to go on holidays to Crab Island!&#10;&#10;",

The attack came to grief in large part because of the deadly fire of German 88s well-emplaced in several key positions, but most famously at the key defile of Halfaya Pass, forever after known as Hellfire Pass.&#10;&#10;THE GAME&#10;&#10;Hellfire Pass is a World War II simulation of the British Battleaxe offensive on 15-17 June, 1941. Operation Brevity is also included as an introductory scenario. This game marks a long-awaited, new chapter for the fast-playing, operational-level system enjoyed by many in Beda Fomm &ndash; a classic Frank Chadwick game design. The popularity of the game system is its blend of simple gaming mechanics that delivers fast-paced, nail-biting action suitable for solitaire or competition play.&#10;&#10;Fans of Beda Fomm will be pleased to learn that the original game system has been retained, while also evolving and elaborating on it to best capture the protracted nature of the battles in this game. Both the Brevity and Battleaxe offensives were examples of protracted combat where both sides were challenged to sustain their efforts in the field while also maneuvering aggressively over a wider landscape.  New rules covering Supply, Repairs and Regrouping, and Morale Recovery represent additions that speak to that need to sustain operations in the face of losses. The game also reflects the greater availability of certain weapons &ndash; primary AT guns.&#10;&#10;Now available for preorder from Consim Press&#10;&#10;",

Each turn, players activate a square with one of their Fighters, which either activates combat (if enemies are in the square), or allows that Fighter to move. Combat is decided via secretly selected cards for each Fighter. Some moves allow the Fighters to travel in time, but will, over time, lock off the board to Time Travel, preventing others from doing the same.&#10;&#10;Fighters can also grab items in the square they're in, which will give them extra abilities in their future.&#10;&#10;Players get Victory Points for:&#10;&#10;     having living Fighters,&#10;     killing other Fighters,&#10;     having Fighters with long timelines,&#10;     travelling backwards in time; and&#10;     grabbing VP items on the board&#10;&#10;&#10;The Fight ends when an entire squad is dead, most of the board is locked, or a player reaches 8 Victory Points.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In Intrigo the players are pirates on a pirate ship. Half of the ship's crew is loyal to the captain, but the other half is plotting to kill the captain and take control of the ship. Who will come out of this struggle victoriously?&#10;&#10;At the start of the game each player will receive a card. On this card is a unique role and a team indication (either red or blue). Many of the roles have some sort of special power. Players do not show their role card to others. Only one player will reveal his role immediately: this is the player which has the captain role (and who is on the blue team).&#10; The blue team wins if they succeed in killing all of the players in the red team. The red team wins if they succeed in killing the captain. However, as long as the blue player with the bodyguard role is alive, the captain cannot be killed by red players.&#10;&#10;The game plays in night and day phases, just like in Werewolf. In the first night, the captain and bodyguard will get to know each other. Also, the players on the red team will get to know each other, but only partially: one player on the red team is the team leader. This player will open his eyes (&quot;wake up&quot;) and will make eye contact with other red players one-by-one. This means that the red team leader knows who all of the red players are, but all the other red players will only know the red team leader but none of the other team mates.&#10;&#10;In the game, players are eliminated at night by roles that become active then (usually red players). Players are also eliminated by day, as at the end of each day usually one player will be nominated to &quot;walk the plank&quot; (and will thus be eliminated). The captain can never be nominated to walk the plank. There are various player roles which can perform special night and day actions. These actions include finding out more about other players, kill them, or protect them.&#10;&#10;What sets this game apart from Werewolf is that most of the night actions require the player performing them to actually touch the player to which it is directed. This not only makes it harder to kill players further away from you, it also increases chances that some kind of noise or movement will be felt by the other players (which have their eyes closed during the nights). This in turn gives players during the day 'evidence' to accuse other players of being on the red team, and thus a good candidate to 'walk the plank'!&#10;&#10;Intrigo shares game mechanisms with Werewolf (e.g., two teams that battle for victory, day/night phases, hidden roles with special powers) and BANG! (hidden roles and only one role is known to all players).&#10;&#10;The game is language-dependent: the texts on the cards are in the Dutch language, and currently there is only a Dutch rule set available.&#10;&#10;",

Gameplay is fast and furious, and with super simple rules, everyone can get in on the action as quickly as you can take the game out of the box.&#10;&#10;In &quot;challenge&quot; mode, players have more options, but gameplay is still easy to learn and quick to play. Power-Ups make your dino more powerful by increasing its offense or defense. Customize your dino with nine different Power-Ups into a offensive dino of destruction or an armor clad defensive dino of doom &mdash; but you'll still need to be quick as play is always real-time...&#10;&#10;",

Players can start any number of fruit sequences, but they can only have one sequence of each kind of fruit (e.g. they cannot have two plum sequences on their own playing area), so they can compile 6 different sequences at most. Your aim is to get all 5 of the collected fruits with different numbers (from 1 to 5). If somebody collected a sequence which does not meet these demands, they will get less points or none. (If you collected from 1 to 5 &ndash; 11 points, if number 1 is missing from a sequence &ndash; 0 point, if a number occurs more than once in a sequence &ndash; 0 point!)&#10;&#10;The player who collects the highest number of points using their excellent memory skills will be the winner!&#10;&#10;",

But while navigating through the lab to get back to the monkeys, one of your friends knocks over a beaker of The Competitive Edge. Due to the current side effect, everyone is now under the impression that this is a competition and whomever frees the most monkeys wins.&#10;&#10;Monkeys Need Love Too is a fast paced, action card game where you compete to free as many monkeys as possible while at the same time preventing your opponents from doing the same.&#10;&#10;Game play is divided into two phases. In the main phase, Flinging Poo, players take turns around the table. A player's turn starts off by drawing your hand to reload back up to 5 cards. If you draw banana cards, they are set aside and you keep drawing. Next the player has the option to play one monkey card and one action card.  Afterwards they must feed their monkeys using the bananas they have stored. If a monkey can't be fed, he/she is discarded. And lastly, the player may discard any cards out of their hand in the hopes of drawing better ones or more bananas next turn.&#10;&#10;The game is over when some plays the action card &quot;No Coco, No!!&quot;.  If successful, this ends the Flinging Poo phase and triggers the To the Trees phase. Everyone must now draw for their end fate. Do they escape?  Must they sacrifice some of their monkeys to do so? Do they find new monkeys while on the way out? In the end, the person who freed the most monkeys without being caught is the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Brewin' USA is a thematic Eurogame in which players control a start-up brewery at the inception of the craft beer revolution. Players will need to collect key ingredients, launch a product line of &quot;liquid gold&quot; craft beer, and strategically compete for regional control across the nation.&#10;&#10;A game turn consists of three phases: Ingredient Auction, Launching Beers, and Resolving any Brewfests. During the Auction Phase, players compete for the ingredient cards needed to launch their beer via a turn-based bidding system. Any bids entered are then turned into craft beer &quot;market demand&quot; that is dispersed at the discretion of the players making each play through unique and delivering many interesting decisions. Each beer card has an ingredient recipe that must be satisfied before the beer can be brewed and one of six different beer styles that tailor better to certain cities which will be key when competing for regional control. When a player brews a beer, they must choose to control an open city location or challenge an controlled city to a brewfest where the winner of the brewfest will control the city. If any player controls the most cities in a region at the end of the game, then they control the region. The game ends when the first player brews three beers, and points are then totaled counting beer quality and reputation on cities and any regions you control.&#10;&#10;Brewin' USA aims to deliver a quick strategic euro experience paired with a very approachable theme and thrives on its player interaction. The game play revolves around Beer Coaster tiles delivering new twists on fun mechanisms and components including 105 Bottle caps to be used for both money and victory points. The player interaction comes from the Brewfest event in the game, which ramps us as more players grow their craft beer product lines and are chomping to establish their control in the regions.&#10;&#10;",

Unfortunately, there is no shortage of antagonists in space. Your ship has different systems represented by dice. Can you keep your ship on course for the battles with the alien vessels crowding the galaxy?&#10;&#10;Starcade has 3 distinct modes of play:&#10;-Solo&#10;-Player vs Player&#10;-Co-op&#10;&#10;Each mode was designed separately using the components in this pocket sized game.&#10;&#10;1-3 people can play Starcade with a single pack, up to 6 with 2 packs (Player vs Player only).&#10;&#10;Players first set up their system resources. Then players roll attack dice to battle the alien drones, fellow pilots, or the dreaded Mega-Mothership. In Solo mode players fight through waves of drones in an attempt to defeat them and a mothership with the most Victory Points possible. Players will have to carefully manage their ships resources and decide which ship upgrades to purchase. The upgrades are powerful, but they cost the Player Victory Points to purchase them.&#10;&#10;In the multiplayer mode Players roll their attack dice to see who will be the last ship standing. Players will have a limited bonus resource to work with and must be careful when to use it. This is the fastest mode of play and easy to take and play anywhere.&#10;&#10;Finally, the Co-op mode offers the chance for players to work together to defeat the Mega-Mothership before her powerful arsenal conquers them and maybe even the universe.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Heiji no Ran is a doujinshi (self-published) simulation of the conflict in Heiankyo, Japan between factions of the Minamoto and Taira warrior houses during the twelfth month of the first year of Heiji (January-February of 1160 by the Western calendar). The game's full name is &quot;Heiji No Ran: Heiji Gannen (1160) (&#229;&#185;&#179;&#230;&#178;&#187;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#185;&#177;&#239;&#188;&#154;&#229;&#185;&#179;&#230;&#178;&#187;&#229;&#133;&#131;&#229;&#185;&#180; (1160), Heiji Disturbance: First Year Of Heiji 1160)&quot;. Stemming from resentments brought on by the results of the earlier Hogen no Ran in 1156, the Minamoto along with their Fujiwara allies attacked the Taira and attempted to seize control of the government.&#10;&#10;When Taira no Kiyomori left the capital on a pilgrimage, Minamoto no Yoshitomo (Kiyomori's ally in the 1156 conflict) and Fujiwara no Nobuyori took advantage of his absence to kidnap both the Tenno (Emperor) Nijo and the retired Tenno (or Ho, retired Emperor) Go-Shirakawa. They imprisoned the two, burned their palaces, forced them to appoint Nobuyori as Chancellor, and executed Taira ally and Go-Shirakawa confidant Fujiwara no Michinori. However, Kiyomori was informed of their treachery and quickly returned to Heiankyo. His rapid return surprised the Minamoto and left them unsure as to how to proceed. The Minamoto were further confused when Kiyomori made a false offer of surrender to Nobuyori. The Minamoto ended up taking no action against a still gathering and vulnerable Taira force, and Kiyomori also managed to engineer a rescue of both Go-Shirakawa and Nijo.&#10;&#10;A strengthened Taira force made the first move, attacking the Minamoto in the Imperial Palace. Fujiwara no Nobuyori ran off but the Minamoto gave battle. Luring the Minamoto out with a feigned retreat, the Taira then occupied the palace, leaving the Minamoto with no avenue of retreat. Instead of trying to reclaim the palace, the Minamoto attacked the Taira's stronghold of Rokuhara in southeast Heiankyo. While Rokuhara would have been an easy target earlier, it had now been reinforced and proved too much for the Minamoto. Their forces eventually broke and scattered. Their leader Yoshitomo was later betrayed by a vassal and killed. While the fighting was of a relatively small scale, it had far reaching effects. With all opposition effectively eliminated, the Taira became the most powerful family in Japan and the first warrior house to exert a large measure of influence and control on the Imperial Court. However, they failed to kill off all the Minamoto heirs, something that was to come back to haunt them in 1180 when Kiyomori managed to have his grandson installed as Tenno...a move that provoked a chain of events that led to the Genpei War.&#10;&#10;The game shares its rules system with its predecessor, &quot;Hogen no Ran&quot;. Both games put an emphasis on the favored samurai tactics of the time-night attacks, torching the strongholds of your opponents, and misdirection. The map for Heiji no Ran expands upon the one for Hogen no Ran, including the southern portion of Heiankyo as well as the northern. This allows the fighting to take place all over the city as it did historically, particularly near the Taira's headquarters in Rokuhara. The game runs for 11 turns, taking the action from the 26th day of the 12th month (the day the actual fighting began) in the first year of Heiji to the 29th day (February 5-8, 1160, two turns per day with a night turn). Forces of the various factions are individual leaders with associated clansmen, rated for both troop strength and leader ability. Victory is determined by unit losses, possession of the Tenno/Ho, and occupation of certain locations. As with its sister game it does an excellent job of simulating the battle (in this case as recorded in the Heiji Monogatari (a gunkimono-'war tale'-written around the year 1200). Heiji no Ran plays well with a low number of counters, short completion time, and a well thought out game system with sufficient chrome. It's nicely balanced and an early, well thought out Minamoto strike will often bring victory.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Mine, All Mine! is a quick, fun game of mining planets for resources.  You manage a small hand of spaceships and actions, trying to outwit and outmaneuver your opponents.  With only 16 game cards, 8 tracking clips, and a table-free option, Mine, All Mine! can be played just about anywhere.  And with a 5-10 minute play time, it&rsquo;s easy to fit a game in while waiting in line or riding in a car (playing while driving is NOT recommended).  We hope you enjoy playing Mine, All Mine!&#10;&#10;Game Play Overview:&#10;Each player starts with 3 Ship cards.  Each card has 4 options to chose from and players can play as few as 1 up to their entire hand each round.  They play these Ship cards to control and mine resource laden planets, with all players laying down their chosen cards at the same time. When the resources are divided up (based on a fleet's total Speed, Attack and Cargo) points are awarded accordingly. Then, new Ship cards are dealt, equal to the number that were just played, beginning with the player with the lowest score. New Planets are dealt and the next round begins.  After 3 rounds the game ends and the player with the greatest score emerges victorious!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In CIA Sniper, you are a newly trained agent specializing in sniper ops. Your new job is to work with foreign &#10;agencies and travel the globe tracking down International Terrorists, Drug leaders, Dictators, Assassins, and &#10;all-around bad people. You are given a steady stream of contracts to develop your skills and earn money. In &#10;the beginning you will travel the globe accepting the easier contracts for quick cash and skill development. &#10;As your skills increase you can accept more difficult contracts which will earn you even more money and skill &#10;points. Each contract provides specific locations and target parameters that will take you across the globe&#10;into different cities, earning huge payoffs for success and more aggressive tactics from Enemy agents. Don't &#10;stay in a specific city too long or these enemy agents will track you down and try to capture you. &#10;Each new contract will confront you with many decisions: what type of weather will you have to deal with, &#10;how long do you have to complete the contract, what location will the shot take place at and how much will &#10;you earn when the contract is completed. &#10;With the completion of each contract, you will earn money and valuable skill points which you can apply to &#10;the six skill sets to help increase your abilities to become a proficient sniper. As you fulfill contracts you &#10;become more of a threat and more enemy agents seek you out. If you stay alive long enough and don&rsquo;t get &#10;caught, you will eventually complete enough contracts and earn enough money to become the greatest sniper &#10;in the CIA&#10;&#10;",

Heroes may be &ldquo;squished&rdquo; to use for their special ability and discarded, or they may be placed into the monster&rsquo;s teacup to drink later for victory points. Once all of the heroes have been plucked from the labyrinth, each monster finishes drinking their tea, counts the victory points in their stomach, and the one with the highest score may belch and rejoice, for they are the winner!&#10;&#10;This simple, family-friendly tabletop game can be played in under 20 minutes with 2-4 players. While adults may be playing for points, kids seem to have more fun squishing the heroes and using their abilities to spill, steal, or trade teacups with the other players.&#10;&#10;Epic Monster Tea Party can be enjoyed by everyone, young and old! It's simple to learn, quick to play, and the artwork will charm your socks off!&#10;&#10;",

Under the guidance of Chef Cordelia Rumplebum, you will be taught the fine art of baking delicious foods with only the finest ingredients: crunchy, juicy, savory bugs!&#10;&#10;The Rumplebum Academy for Bug-Based Baking is a lighthearted memory and set-collection game. The players are trolls who are going out into the forest to turn over rocks, looking for bugs. They'll use those bugs in the recipes they bake back at the school. But they'd better be careful, because sometimes they'll turn over a Knight who might attack! Then again, they might find a beautiful Princess to help with the next dish.&#10;&#10;",

Only the trader with the freshest goods will get the most customers.&#10;&#10;In Fresh Fish you try to build your market stalls as close as possible to the matching delivery trucks on a huge market square. A delivery of goods directly from the delivery truck into the market stall is not allowed; at least one path space must lie between them. Unfortunately the competition between the traders is quite intense, so you will block each other from the shortest paths with your market stalls. Neutral flea market tables will get in the way, too.&#10;&#10;To secure the prime spaces for your market stalls, you must buy the stall tiles cheaply at an auction &mdash; but if you bid too little and lose the auctions you may later get a space much further away.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game you add all the paths between your market stalls and the delivery trucks, then subtract the saved coins from this sum. The player with the lowest value wins as he offers the freshest goods to his customers!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Glorantha: The Gods War is a competitive strategy game in which 3 or 4 players (3 to 8 players with the Empires expansion) summon units (minions, heroes, lesser gods and usually one greater god); construct buildings (usually Shrines, Temples, and Ziggurats) and clash in mortal combat. The players seek to build their own strength and destroy their enemies by killing their enemies' units and capturing and destroying their enemies' buildings, to achieve Heroquests and thus earn gifts, and to earn runes with unique effects. Each empire has its own, and different, unique ability, weakness, greater god ability, units, Heroquests and gifts. For example, the Darkness empire features trolls, the Mistress (Cragspider), shades, and the Hellmother (Kyger Litor), while the Sky empire has archers, the Emperor, phoenixes, and the Sun God (Yelm). These are not just the same units with different names, but also have different abilities, as do their buildings. Chaos has both different buildings, three greater gods (the Unholy Trio) and a different agenda to the other empires. The game has a world-shattering &quot;mythic&quot; feel to it rather than a &ldquo;fantasy adventure&rdquo; sensation.&#10;&#10;Glorantha: The Gods War is based on the vigorous mythic realm of Glorantha, which has been the basis for multiple tabletop board, roleplaying, and even digital games, as well as numerous works of fiction. Its depth and scope has been recognized by numerous aficionados of fantasy and gaming, and now it is brought to you in all its astounding power.&#10;&#10;In each round, in the Action Phase players spend the power they have earned from various sources, most importantly how many different types of buildings they have and the Heroquests they have achieved. They then spend power to build more buildings, summon and move units, do battle with enemy empires, and use powerful empire-specific abilities including from their earned gifts. The Council Phase may include an attempt to close the Chaos Rift that threatens the existence of the world and/or the Great Compromise in which an empire may sacrifice power for the greater good and to distribute victory points.&#10;&#10;Victory is determined by obtaining victory points from various sources, most importantly the number of buildings controlled each round, paired Heroquests achieved and the Great Compromise, and from runes.&#10;&#10;",

With the world, art, and visual designs created by artist John Hathway, and game system designer Takashi Sakaue, this is JH Lab's latest attempt to expand &quot;true understanding&quot; of otaku culture.&#10;&#10;The game is set in a possible future world where science and spirituality have merged, causing a certain regression of technology. Mainly, it is found that spirits could be contained in now-defunct vacuum tubes, which could in turn be used to power various robots and androids. Human beings could transfer their consciousness into androids, and man-made androids could develop human intelligence. The world has embraced this discovery, doing away with any national, religious or ethnic segregation. Instead, people are identified by their intelligence.&#10;&#10;The game utilizes 4 different types of cards. 1, The Android Cards are your main cards which are built up and strengthened by the other cards. 2, The Resource Cards strengthen the androids. 3, The Unique Resrouce Cards are one time use cards capable of changing the properties of gameplay. And, 4, Assist Cards are one time use robots that have the ability to shift the flow of battle! Using these cards, your goal is either to destroy all your opponent's androids, or completely deplete their main card deck.&#10;&#10;",

Players take turns asking questions, with a point being subtracted for each question. Players are awarded points for asking certain key questions that eliminate faux versions of the story.

This sort of gaming procedure effectively encourages players to develop careful analytical questions and eliminates random questions.&#10;&#10;",

Could you set the goals needed to end the war and use the Imperial Japanese Navy in greater effect, which was the strongest in the world at that point, in order to achieve different results? An &quot;if&quot; scenario that history could not forgive, but may be investigated through a simulation game.&#10;&#10;[Pacific War] is a strategic level simulation game of the naval operations in the Pacific from 1941 to the first half of 1944. Players become commanders of the Japanese Imperial Navy and the Allied navy, which is centered around the US navy, and have to plan a strategy and execute it in order to win the war.&#10;&#10;Even though the rules are simple and cover only 4 pages, a unique gaming system is adopted. Similarly to the actual warfare in order to maximize the efficiency of your aircraft carrier task forces will require experience and a significant amount of trial and error.

        "description": "Mimikawa no Tatakai is the fourth entry in the Sengoku Folio battle game series. It's a doujinshi (self-published) game similar in tone to the early SPI folio games-low numbers of counters, compact map, and an easy-to-learn game system used for all the entries in the series. The full name is Mimikawa No Tatakai: Otomo (Tawara) X Shimazu (Takajogawa No Tatakai) 1578.11.12 (&#232;&#128;&#179;&#229;&#183;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;: &#229;&#164;&#167;&#229;&#143;&#139; (&#231;&#148;&#176;&#229;&#142;&#159;) X &#229;&#179;&#182;&#230;&#180;&#165; (&#233;&#171;&#152;&#229;&#159;&#142;&#229;&#183;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;) 1578.11.12, Battle of Mimikawa: Otomo (Tawara) Vs. Shimazu (Battle Of Takajogawa) 1578/11/12).&#10;&#10;Historically, the battle took place in Hyuga province (in the eastern part of Kyushu, Japan's southernmost major island). The Shimazu's increasingly expansionist ways were making the daimyo (feudal lords) in the north of Kyushu uneasy. Otomo Sorin of Bungo province in northeast Kyushu put together a&#227;&#128;&#128;sizable army and sent it south to deal with the Shimazu. The Shimazu in turn dispatched reinforcements north to their outpost at Taka castle. Shimazu Iehisa, Yoshihiro, and Yoshihisa consolidated their forces (along with some troops from their allies in the Ijuuin) at Taka, numbering about 50,000. The Otomo forces dispatched to meet them were made up of about 30,000 troops mainly from the Tawara, Takita, Saeki, and Kuwano families. They were commanded by Otomo Sorin's son-in-law, Tawara Chikataka. On the 12th day of the 11th month of the sixth year of Tensho (December 10, 1578) Tawara made an unwise frontal assault on the castle. After some bitter fighting featuring some of the earliest usage of large numbers of arquebus in Japan, the Otomo forces broke. The Shimazu pursued and many of the Otomo were drowned in the rapid waters of the Mimikawa river to the north. The Otomo lost about twice as many men as the Shimazu, probably about 4,000 or so. The Shimazu continued to push the Otomo back in the ensuing months, eventually forcing the Otomo to request aid from Toyotomi Hideyoshi, giving the warlord and his massive army a handy excuse to add Kyushu to his list of conquests.&#10;&#10;The battle is played out in eight turns. Victory is determined by both enemy casualties and possession of Taka Castle. Special rules account for the Otomo cannon (a rare instance during the Sengoku of cannon being used in the field). Counters are rated for morale, combat strength (melee), and marksmanship (in this case, the arquebus). While the Otomo have the numerical advantage in overall combat strength and counters and a couple of cannon, the Shimazu have better morale and more leaders, making things more or less even. An enjoyable play that rewards individual skill.&#10;&#10;",

It's also a well-known fact that the only way to get to BE a bigger goblin is to eat a good breakfast.  This makes breakfast in the Goblin Warren a highly competitive and somewhat dangerous meal...&#10;&#10;In this card game, players take the role of Goblins at the Breakfast table, scrambling to eat as much food as possible and to prevent other players from doing the same.&#10;&#10;Illustrated by Travis Hansen, the game plays from 2 to 6 players, (more with multiple decks.)  It takes about 5 minutes to learn, and 15 minutes to play.  It includes about 60 cards.&#10;&#10;To start the game, a few cards are dealt out to the center table, and on each turn, players can do one of the following four things.&#10;&#10;A, They can take a food or weapon from the center of the table.&#10;B, If they have a bigger weapon than another player, they can steal another card from another player's hand.&#10;C, If they have a food card in hand they can eat it, scoring it.&#10;D, They can play a special action card from the center of the table, immediately playing its effects.&#10;&#10;The result is a fast-paced, light-hearted arms race, with quickly shifting strategy and chaotic fun.  After the deck runs out, the player that eats the most food wins!&#10;&#10;It should be noted that this game was a finalist for the 2014 Ion Awards at the SaltCon board game convention in Salt Lake City.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Olympus is shaking to its foundations. Faith among the mortals is waning and with it the very power of the pantheon. Zeus is in a rage: &quot;Hear me, gods! I command you to send forth my MONSTROUS pets. Make them rain from the sky and erupt from the underworld. We will rekindle these mortals' faith - through FEAR!&quot;&#10;&#10;Monstrous is a game of gods and monsters, fear and faith, dexterous skills and tactical combos.&#10;&#10;Players are Greek gods throwing mythical monster cards from their hand onto a shared tableau of ancient Greek locations to gain as much 'Faith' as possible. But a strong guiding hand is not enough - cunning use of tactical monster and location powers is the key to gaining the most faith of all the gods, and the favor of Zeus.&#10;&#10;During setup, a number of large location cards equal to the number of gods are arranged on the table - these are selected from 12 ancient Greek cities where the insolent humans cower. Locations have special powers and provide Faith when hit by Monsters. Depending on the number of gods playing, each god has a randomly constructed deck of between 7 and 10 out of 12 mythical monster cards, each with their own special power. Each god shuffles and readies these decks, then draws 3 of their monster cards ready to throw at locations and monsters already on the table.&#10;&#10;On their turn, a god chooses a single monster from their hand, and throws it (without their hand crossing the table edge) attempting to hit:&#10;1. a location - to use its special power, and any thrown monster power that affect locations, and gain its Faith.&#10;2. other monster cards on the table - to use the special power of their thrown monster on the other gods&rsquo; monsters. &#10;3. ideally both at the same time!&#10;&#10;Look for the best cards to throw and the best targets to throw at. But beware: monsters may do unpredictable and dangerous things. Some monsters even act like traps on the table, taking effect as soon as they are hit. If Olympus is in play, powerful legendary monsters can be gained for gods to throw too.&#10;&#10;Once a god has finished their turn, they draw a new monster and play proceeds to the next god. This proceeds until one god runs out of monster cards completely. Each other god then takes 1 final turn before the god with the highest Faith is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;Monstrous blends stunning art of mythic Greece with quick card throwing, fist pumping action and the tactical combos that gods and gamers love. Every game is different and there are optional rules to tailor your MONSTROUS experience for children, team play and longer games with legendary monsters.&#10;&#10;And yes, you can release the Kraken.&#10;&#10;",

Players can stop rolling any time they want, but if a player manages to use every single one of their dice, they can take all their dice back and keep going, with each encounter being worth double points! You can spend these points on later turns to buy item cards that can help you manipulate the dice.&#10;&#10;If you fail, other players can leap at the opportunity to &quot;assist&quot; you (using their items to help you win in exchange for half the points, and you can't refuse!) or just let you fail and ride on your coat-tails, picking up where you left off.&#10;&#10;",

With no one else, the Doctor's past regenerations have been gathered to help. Whoever finds the Black Scroll and escapes first wins!&#10;&#10;TARDIS Run is a 3D printed, Print 'n Play, two-player game as inspired by Backgammon, Parcheesi and Senet, a game played by the Ancient Egyptians. This game turns the standard &quot;roll and move&quot; upside down by making you choose which character to move before you throw the paddles and add them up to move the piece you've chosen. But the very uneven distribution of the paddles means you can rely on the pieces probably moving 3 spaces. However, when the black scroll of Rassilon is found (by rolling all blanks) with it's 2x multiplier on one side the statistics become considerably harder to predict.&#10;&#10;The board for this game is designed to fold into a neat carrying case that holds everything necessary to play inside.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Hetsugigawa no Tatakai is the fifth entry in the Sengoku Folio battle game series. It's a doujinshi (self-published) game similar in tone to the early SPI folio games-low numbers of counters, compact map, and an easy-to-learn game system used for all the entries in the series. The full name is &quot;Hetsugigawa No Tatakai: Toyotomi (Sengoku) X Shimazu-1587.1.20 (&#230;&#136;&#184;&#230;&#172;&#161;&#229;&#183;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;: &#232;&#177;&#138;&#232;&#135;&#163;&#227;&#128;&#128;(&#228;&#187;&#153;&#231;&#159;&#179;) X &#229;&#179;&#182;&#230;&#180;&#165;&#227;&#128;&#128;1587.1.20, Battle Of Hetsugigawa: Toyotomi (Sengoku) Vs. Shimazu-1587/1/20)&quot;. In this case, the 'Sengoku' in parenthesis doesn't mean 'Warring States' (pronounced the same, different kanji) but rather is the name of the Toyotomi commander who provoked the battle with a foolhardy assault.&#10;&#10;After responding to a request for aid against the Shimazu by the Otomo, Toyotomi Hideyoshi prepared a huge army to take the island of Kyushu. His vanguard consisted of forces from the Sengoku and Chosokabe (around 20,000 in all)-they entered Bungo province in NE Kyushu and were instructed to stay on the defensive until the Toyotomi main body arrived. Instead, samurai being samurai and not inclined to listen to anyone, Sengoku Hisahide decided to attempt the relief of nearby Toshimitsu Castle (then being besieged by the Shimazu). The Chosokabe protested but eventually joined the assault, figuring that if Sengoku was determined to go through with the assault it would be better to join in than to sit by doing nothing. However, the Shimazu were aware of their advance and increased their efforts to take the castle, laying claim to it before the Toyotomi forces arrived. Undeterred, the Toyotomi forces (also with elements of the Otomo and Sogou, about 7,000 in all) gathered for battle on the 12th day of the 12th month of the 14th year of Tenshou (January 20, 1587). The Shimazu (with a large number of allies from the Ijuuin, the force adding up to about 15,000) provoked an attack with a feigned retreat (a favorite Shimazu tactic), luring the Toyotomi into an ambush and routing their forces. The Toyotomi withdrew from Bungo and this was to be the high point of the Shimazu-things would be far different when the Toyotomi main force arrived.&#10;&#10;The battle is played out in eight turns. Victory is determined by both enemy casualties and possession of the two castles on the field. Counters are rated for morale, combat strength (melee), and marksmanship (in this case, the arquebus). The Toyotomi forces face a tough fight as they're outnumbered almost two to one by a Shimazu force with superior morale. Thankfully, they aren't required to be be as stupid as Sengoku Hisahide.&#10;&#10;",

There are two levels of play, Apprentice and Executive, to ease younger players into the mechanics.&#10;&#10;Apprentice Game&#10;&#10;You start the game with a set of brand cards (one per brand category per player) which are shuffled and dealt to you. You are also given 50 million and the youngest player starts. You place your chosen playing piece on the board (you can start anywhere) and move the number you spin with the arrow in the centre of the board.  Each time you land on a coloured square you collect two more brand cards of that colour, or one if the board instructs you. Once you have three or more of a coloured brand you can announce a launch of your company. The person to your right shuffles the risky business cards, turning the cards over one at a time, so you can judge how much you will risk without getting a BUST! card. You then multiply the money by the number of brand cards you launched with. No takeover or newsflash cards are used.&#10;&#10;Executive Rules&#10;&#10;Add in the newsflash cards for a chance, which could be good or bad (named brands will change in value), and you have a game with a greater element of risk. These rules differ as you now have the chance when you land on the takeover spots on the board to pick up a takeover disc. The next time one of your competitors launches a company you can attempt a takeover. Adding the total of your brand cards, plus any additional 'on the up' brands, plus a spin of the central spinner. If you beat the opponent you win all their cards but be careful if you lose they launch their company with more brands and therefore can earn more money.&#10;&#10;",

Each player starts the game with six dice of a single color, and three target cards are laid face-up on the table. Players take turns doing the following: On a turn, a player rolls all of her dice not already on cards, then places any dice that match the targets on the corresponding cards. (Alternatively, before taking her turn, a player can first choose to reclaim all of her dice from all cards.)&#10;&#10;If the player now fulfills the target with her dice &ndash; e.g., a pair of 3s, a quartet of 6s, or a specific combination of numbers &ndash; she claims the card, takes back her dice (and returns any other dice on the card to their owner), then places a new card on the table. Each card is worth a certain number of points. The first player to earn forty or more points wins!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "BACKGROUND: By Fire and Sword is semi-historical simulation of the Thirty Years War. The game begins just after the Bohemian Revolt where the very Catholic Ferdinand II (future Holy Roman Emperor) of Austria was elected to the Thrones of Bohemia and Hungary. Many Protestants felt they would lose their religious rights and a small revolt occurred. This revolt soon spread as other Protestant leaders felt emboldened.  The Player represents the Commander of the Protestant Forces with the goal to overthrow the Holy Roman Empire. As the Commander of the Protestant Forces, you must control a significant number of Cities and Towns throughout Europe before the last Campaign Card is Played.&#10;&#10;GAME OBJECTIVE: Player takes command of the Protestant Forces. The Player&rsquo;s Objective is to attempt to control at least 16 Cities and 14 Towns before the &ldquo;Peace of Westphalia&rdquo; Card is Played. If the Catholics control 16 Cities and 14 Towns at the end of their Turn, the Holy Roman Empire wins.&#10;&#10;By Fire and Sword is a fast and fun game with lots of colorful game counters representing the various military units of the time, including Pike &amp; Musket, Musketeers, Cavalry, Cuirassiers and Cannon. Major leaders of the war are represented and lead forces on the map. Battles and Sieges have, almost, a &quot;miniatures&quot; feel to them as they are resolved on a Battle Mat.&#10;&#10;GAME MECHANICS: The Player moves his Leader Counters on the Map along with their Troop Points. If a Battle occurs, Troop Points are exchanged for Tactical Units and combat is carried out in a Tactical manner on a Battle Mat. If there are any Reserve Units in the &quot;Play Area&quot;, he may add them to a Battle Force.&#10;&#10;",

Players move their &quot;caps&quot; around the board according spinner. If a player lands on another cap or a stack of caps, that player captures the stack by nesting his/her cap on top of the stack. The game ends when there is only one active color of caps left on the board. Caps on spaces with an 'F' or matching color can't be caught. Ending on a 'F'-space all captured caps must be released.&#10;&#10;Game 2: More like Pachisi (kicking out other ones), but additionally players must perform one of the 4 basic arithmetic operations (according spinner &amp; space) moving their meeples.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Pickup season is open! All thanks to Demoralizer, a love battle where no holds are barred.&#10;&#10;This card game by Krzysztof Miller overcomes the classic scheme of game for couples, and makes a perfect example of playing with the form and breaking stereotypes. The game can be played by 2 &ndash; 6 people, who have only one goal &ndash; to demoralize the opponents. Each player takes the role of one of the six available characters: Blondi, Gangster, XXX Actor, Vamp, Scientist, or&hellip;  Grandma. Each character is described by four indicators: sex appeal, composure, cleverness, and morality. The level of these features, however, can be changed while playing the game by the action of cards, which players use during gameplay, as well as a direct result of actions taken by the opponents. To perform a successful pickup, thus depriving the other player his morality points, the level of attacking player&rsquo;s sex appeal must be higher than the composure of defending player. Only adequate calculation and analysis of indicators&rsquo; levels can protect a player against demoralization.&#10;&#10;The game is divided into players&rsquo; turns. Each player&rsquo;s turn is divided into six phases: discarding, drawing, activation, playing cards, seduction, and final phase. During the playing cards phase, players play on the table their cards from hand: action, helper, item, event or skill. To do this, however, a player has to pay the cost with his cleverness points. In addition, the character cards determine how many cards of a particular type the player can handle. Seduction phase is optional. A player may, but don&rsquo;t have to, try to attack any number of opponents during his turn. Futhermore, a player can attack not only with his character card, but also with helper cards, if he has got them. The same applies to defense.&#10;&#10;When the level of player character&rsquo;s morality drops to zero, that player loses and he is automatically eliminated from further play. The game continues until only one player remains and becomes the ultimate demoralizer.&#10;&#10;Demoralizer is a game for those who in the heat of battle do not forget about strategic thinking. Thanks to unique characters&rsquo; features, playing each of them requires a slightly different approach. The differences in the attributes determine strategy - sometimes player's attacks will be more frequent, or on the contrary - he will have to raise composure level and wait for the right moment to pickup the opponent.&#10;&#10;The average gameplay takes approx. 30-45 minutes.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Admiral's Order: Naval Tactics in the Age of Sail &ndash; All Hands! is a simulation of naval engagements between ships-of-the-line and frigates in the Age of Fighting Sail. The focus of the game lies on the wars between Britain and France and her allies in the years 1775 to 1815. Each player takes on the role of an admiral, commander or captain whose command could include a single ship or a fleet of several vessels. The core game (&quot;All Hands!&quot;) has five scenarios to choose from, everything from a small, fast and furious encounter between two frigates to a strategic action involving a total of 16 ships-of&ndash;the-line.&#10;&#10;A game turn equates to a &frac12;-hour watch on the day of battle. In each turn, players will play cards to execute sailing maneuvers such as tacking, wearing, or changing sail configuration in order to put their ships into position for devastating broadsides or even rakes on the enemy vessels.&#10;&#10;In larger engagements, ships are grouped together in squadrons and usually form a &quot;Line of Battle&quot;, a formation that provides the commander with the most control over his fleet. Using Admiral's Order cards players signal general commands to their squadrons ranging from &quot;Form a Keel Line&quot; and &quot;Wearing in succession&quot; to &quot;Prepare for Close Action&quot;. Keeping the ships in formation and effectively deploying the fleet in the heat of battle while also retaining the initiative is the main challenge for a commander.&#10;&#10;Occasionally, ships will engage each other in brutally destructive Close Quarter combat. In such situations, the game &quot;zooms&quot; into the action: Using a set of &quot;Close Action&quot; cards, players can employ grapeshot, grenades, carronades, and sharpshooters to wreak destruction on the opposing vessel's upper deck. Through a clever use of grappling hooks and boarding crews it is possible to overcome the enemy's defenses to take the ship as the ultimate prize.&#10;&#10;All scenarios can be played by two players, but most also provide the option to split command between two players per side. Playing time depends on the scenario. While an engagement between two frigates should last no more than 1-2 hours, fighting the Battle of Cape Henry will take four hours or longer.&#10;&#10;The game is produced in a small edition and comes in a beautiful box, designed with a picture from Thomas Whitcombe. It has a wooden presentation box with 36 hand-crafted, wooden ship models. Each ship comes with removable masts and ship names burned into each side.&#10;&#10;",

By rolling a 20-sided die&#10;2. By flipping the top card of Your &quot;fate&quot; deck.&#10;&#10;The first thought of this game was in April 2013, but not until February 2014 that I found the mechanics that I want to use to fuel my ideas. After that a working prototype has been made, and during several test the game had gotten a good reception. Now it's in a very advance test shape.&#10;&#10;Recently a 4th prototype version was printed with minor changes in game mechanics, and with prototype card layouts, and new game board preparing the title for release.&#10;&#10;",

All hope lies on the mighty heroes who unite to defend its walls.&#10;&#10;B-Sieged: Sons of the Abyss is a fully cooperative castle defense board game that combines exciting combat action with classic resource management. In this thrilling battle, 1 to 6 players control the mighty Heroes of Modhelm, who must endure the siege of the encroaching enemies and hold out long enough for the Messenger to return with a powerful magic artifact that will break the enemy forces.&#10;&#10;During their turn, Heroes may take 3 actions. They can spend these actions to visit the various buildings inside the Citadel to get resources (such as Food, Gold, Special Abilities, and Cards), repair damaged buildings, trade cards, fight Enemies from the walls, or try to use the powerful catapult at the center of the Citadel. The Heroes must coordinate their actions well to share resources, gather vital supplies, and survive the siege.&#10;&#10;After the Heroes have acted, it&rsquo;s the Monsters' turn. Each monster figure on the board will activate and perform their actions according to its rank. For 12 rounds that encompass the 4 seasons, the heroes must fight to keep the citadel safe. If the messenger can return in time with the magic artifact, the abyssal forces will be cast back into the fiery darkness.&#10;&#10;To make matters worse, a surprise disruption may summon the Avatar of the Abyss itself! This behemoth marches inexorably towards the citadel. Stop it in time, or it&rsquo;ll shatter the defenses, and destroy the citadel!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Points are earned for defeating enemy cards and taking objectives, but combat can result in lost cards and the dilution of the deck with disorganized cards providing a tense &quot;deck survival&quot; experience.&#10;&#10;Combat includes small arms fire, suppression fire, bazookas, gammon grenades, anti-tank guns, indirect artillery support and air strikes. German cards represent the actual forces and terrain present including personnel from Ost battalions and static divisions, armored cars, STUGs, blockhouses, Rommel's asparagus and flooded fields. The objective cards represent the actual causeways, locks, artillery positions, headquarters and other locations that were assigned and have features unique to each.&#10;&#10;Assign your airborne cards to one of three areas: The Battleground, Support Area, or the Reserve. Weigh the cost of buying time with your troopers against suffering reverses in order to get more and better equipped men. Do you take the mortar from the drop zone for its firepower or a high ranking officer for his additional actions? Only the airborne commander can decide.&#10;&#10;Airborne Commander First Printing includes two full color decks each in its own tuck box. The card illustrations include 40 original paintings of men in action, equipment and locations.&#10;&#10;Airborne Commander Second Printing includes two full color decks and rules in the box.

Players compete using strategy and of course the luck of the draw.&#10;&#10;Easy to learn and endlessly replayable.&#10;&#10;Players take turns drawing a card, then playing 1 card face down and/or 1 card face up.  Only Money or Nuke cards are played face down, since they are secret. Opponents can play a variety of face up cards, like Spy, Sanctions or Economic Failure, to see the secret cards and possibly remove them.&#10;There are also War and Peace cards.  They are played in a shared space called the War Line.  The game is over when there are 7 War cards in the War Line, or when the deck runs out of cards.  Score is based on the values on the Money and Nuke cards, as well as a few bonus modifiers.&#10;&#10;",

Each drone chooses 1-3 cards to play from his/her hand of 7 cards and places the face down on the table. Once everyone is ready, the drones take turns revealing his/her cards. Everydrone adds up his/her productivity for the day. The drone with the highest productivity gets &quot;praise from the boss&quot; and has to draw a career card (which will most likely increase the career stat) and the drone(s) with the lowest productivity gets &quot;yelled at by the boss&quot; and increases their HR Warnings stat; all other drones are safe for the day.

        "description": "From the publisher's web page:&#10;&#10;During the Crisis of the Third Century, the Roman Empire nearly collapsed in the face of calamitous internal and external strife, including continuous civil war and barbarian invasions from all directions.  Beginning with the assassination of Emperor Alexander Severus, a period of 50 years saw nearly as many different men seize imperial power over all or part of the Empire, until the reforms of Diocletian in 284 AD ushered in an era of peace.&#10;&#10;In Time of Crisis, 2-4 players take the reins of Roman dynasties, gathering and wielding influence among the senate, military, and people of Rome to ensure that their legacies are remembered by history instead of being lost to the mists of time.  Starting from control of one province and a few low-value cards, you are challenged to establish your base of power during this fragile period of Roman history.  You must build your armies, take control of valuable provinces, develop your support, and defend yourself against barbarian incursions, inopportune events, and the machinations of your political opponents.&#10;&#10;Time of Crisis is easy to learn and playable in about 2-3 hours.  It incorporates popular game mechanisms such as deckbuilding and hand management, but also delivers a true light wargame experience.  The historical flavor is strong, with many meaningful decisions and opportunities presented to players on the board.  This game finally fully closes the loop between deckbuilding card games and board games.  Your cards dictate what actions are available to you on the board, and in turn, your position on the board directly determines how you can add or remove cards from your deck to make yourself stronger for future turns.  Will you specialize in manipulating the Senate, wielding the power of the Legions, or being a man of the People?  Or will you master a blend of all three?  In a twist unlike most deckbuilding games, you have the privilege of selecting the cards that compose your hand each turn!  However, you still need to eventually work through  your entire deck before you can use your cards again, so deck management and timing is critical.&#10;&#10;All of the key elements of the era are present in Time of Crisis:  civil wars between competing generals and governors, Roman legions defending the frontiers against barbarian tribes, Senate favoritism, barracks emperors, even angry mobs, inflation, the Praetorian Guard, and the ability to carve off your own piece of the Roman Empire.  Can your dynasty arise as the new leaders of the Roman Empire before Diocletian emerges and brings peace once again?&#10;&#10;",

High number goes first. All tiles are then jumbled and distributed evenly and stacked face down in front of each player. First player lays 1,2,3,4 or 5 tiles from his/her hand in a straight line to establish the grid. Tiles laid down must be either different colors of the same number OR a sequence of numbers (up or down) of the same color. Sequences may also roll around e.g. 8,9,0,1,2 etc is OK. If, on your turn, you place a 5th or 10th tile on a line, you get to replenish your hand. Rather than using your turn to add tiles to the grid, you may choose to swap tiles from your hand for already played Wild tiles as long as they work there. The first player to get rid of all of his/her tiles wins.&#10;&#10;",

All lines must contain tiles in which the colors are either all the same OR all different, AND the shapes are also either all the same or all different. There are also shape-specific Wild tiles which can represent any color, and color-specific Wild tiles which can represent any shape. In addition, there are 2 Q!nto tiles which can represent any shape in any color. Instead of adding tiles to the grid, a player may use his/her turn to swap tiles from his/her hand for already played Wild tiles, as long as they work in that position. Q!nto can be played a few different ways. In Q!nto Classic, players keep score. Q!nto Plus allows players to count valid diagonal lines of 3 or more tiles. In Q!nto Light, the tiles are divided evenly among the players who then race to get rid of all their tiles.&#10;&#10;",

By fighting and gaining the will of the tribune you will be able to get the right combination of moves to win the game.&#10;&#10;You will control 5 dice with different cards that represent your preparation, the love of the people and the tricks you've learned through your days in the arena. You have to get a special order of symbols to get the ultimate move to defeat your enemies. But beware! All other gladiators are trying to get that same combination and they will do their best to make you fail!&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is completing a certain order of symbols set by a &quot;combo card&quot; each dice has 6 different symbols and they have to both match the symbols and their order shown in the &quot;combi card&quot; to win the game.&#10;You begin the game by rolling your 5 dice and leaving them in the order you rolled them, then you draw 4 cards from the deck. Each turn, you play one card from your hand and draw another, cards affect your dice or your enemies'. Move them around, change them, or re-roll them to get the winning combination! You must be fast and finish before someone else completes it or changes the required combination seconds before you win the game!&#10;&#10;Bloody sands Dice es un juego basado en el universo de Cruentis que es el mismo de bloody sands arena, a diferencia de arena aqu&iacute; encontraremos dados, estos est&aacute;n personalizados con un s&iacute;mbolo en cada una de sus caras. Cada jugador tiene a su mando 5 dados, 4 de ellos en el juego son denominados &ldquo;tus dados&rdquo; y el quinto que funciona como una especie de comod&iacute;n es denominado &ldquo;el favor del p&uacute;blico&rdquo;; tambi&eacute;n en el juego existe un mazo de 98 cartas que son las que har&aacute;n cambiar a los dados de sitio, cara y orden, el orden es muy importante ya que existen 10 combinaciones en el juego y siempre habr&aacute; una y solo una en juego que es la meta a conseguir para ganarlo, es decir, el que logre completar la secuencia que esta puesta en juego (que es una carta m&aacute;s) gana, aunque hay una dificultad y es que en cualquier momento alguien podr&iacute;a cambiar esta combinaci&oacute;n si lo permites. Otra cosa interesante de este juego es la cantidad de jugadores que pueden entrar, con una caja pueden divertirse hasta 6 personas y lo mejor de todo es que si el cupo no est&aacute; lleno en cualquier momento de la partida puede entrar un nuevo jugador sin afectar el desarrollo del juego. En fin es un juego de astucia y mucha diversi&oacute;n que te har&aacute; pasar un gran rato con tu familia y amigos.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;98 beautifully illustrated cards&#10;30 personalized dice&#10;Rules&#10;&#10;",

Players need to spend their recruiting power wisely, balancing their efforts for each of the four service branches: Army, Navy, Marines and Air Force. It&rsquo;s an advantage to recruit the most people, and it&rsquo;s an advantage to recruit the best people. But that&rsquo;s just the beginning, since allocating your recruits to hotspots around the globe is even more important, and... there are two ways to play!&#10;&#10;In the standard game, there are two decks: one with all the Recruiting Power cards plus two Special cards, and the other with all the Recruit cards. Each player gets a hand of Recruiting Power cards, which are used to sway (i.e., buy) recruits which are constantly coming and going throughout the peak recruiting season. After this first part of the game, 2 VPs are awarded to the player with the most recruits. Then, four further and crucial competitions between the players will take place, and the player who best allocates his/her recruits to the aforementioned hotspots will earn the most VPs and win the game.&#10;&#10;The &quot;friendly&quot; version of the game is a lighter, press your luck design, with unfortunate results for a too-greedy player.&#10;&#10;",

Have you enjoyed a good historical novel dated on the old Republic of Rome, and you would like to travel to that time?&#10;&#10;ONUS! Rome Vs Carthage is a war game similar to miniatures games in which both sides fight an ancient battle. The game is mainly based on the II Punic war, although battles from III to I B.C centuries can be also simulated. The game concept combines both, orders and events cards, that makes each game different and each combat becomes unpredictable and thrilling.&#10;&#10;ONUS! can be played anywhere but to get the best gaming experience we do recommend a game area as large as possible, i.e. 3.2 x 2.9 feet (100 x 90 cm)&#10;&#10;Units are represented by cards which have been scaled around a Centuria (also known as Century) or to a Maniple (also known as Manipulus), representing formations from 80 to 100 men for Infantry units, 20 cavalrymen for Cavalry units or 6 Elephants.&#10;&#10;Units have their own set of traits to represent permanent attributes of the unit, like Melee Combat, Range Attack, Defensive capacity, Morale and Life, and Movement capacity. This set of traits gets bonuses and penalties depending on the ongoing situation and combat engagements.&#10;&#10;Units also have their unique set of skills to represent specific abilities they can perform: from defensive formations to extremely effective techniques to attack enemies. Some of these skills need to be activated, meaning only one of them can be used in an engagement, while others are inherent to the units.&#10;&#10;Leadership is represented in the game by the figure of the General. A General&rsquo;s token represent his HQ and its own escort. In addition to the leadership benefit, a General grants bonuses to nearby units, boosting the morale of the troops and providing additional benefits when they are engaged with the enemy in those bloody encounters. Both, Hannibal and Scipio, two well-known Generals are included in the game with their unique set of bonuses! Also, Heroes, Veterans and Elite units take part in Onus!&#10;&#10;In more detail, ONUS! Rome Vs Carthage is played in turns, composed by six different phases each:&#10;&#10;1.    Activation of Units: in this phase, the active player can play any number of Order cards from his hand, stating what units are going to be used during the turn.&#10;2.    Movement and Charges: in this phase, the active player may move all those units activated in the previous phase. Those units finishing their movement in contact with enemy units, may Charge against them.&#10;3.    Range Attack: those active units able to carry out Ranged Attacks and which haven&rsquo;t moved or executed a Reduced Movement may shoot enemies within its maximum range. Also, special units like Skirmirsher have this skill, thus they may want to use this ability.&#10;4.      Skirmishers: units having these specific skill can harass enemy units, provided they haven't spent all their movement points.&#10;5.    Combat: All engagements are resolved in this phase, being the active player the one choosing the order of combats.&#10;6.    Flee Movement: units fleeing continue their movement if Morale checks fail.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "The game provides a unique experience for families. The challenge is adaptable to the players desire and can be played in Single or Cooperative mode.&#10;&#10;THE OBJECTIVE&#10;In the begining of the game, players receive 4 objective cards of different type that indicate witch tokens they have to find (the tokens in the game setup are placed face down in random order) in the different game-boards. The 4 tokens must be found and placed on each player character sheet in order to a player (or players in coop mode) be able to chalenge the vilain in the end phase of the game.&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY&#10;To move around, in the begining of the turn, a player must take a random encounter card that tells wich character (good or bad) he encounters in his voyage. These cards must be resolved first according to the symbols printed on them. After this, each player moves its marker the number of spaces indicated on that same card.&#10;&#10;Players then explore the boards turning the tokens around and seeing what lies beneath, looking for their 4 objectives.&#10;&#10;Hidden beneath the tokens may be be good things, objects or enemys. Players use the power of food and good nutrition to overcome obstacles trought matching food cards color sequences.&#10;&#10;MEANWHILE&#10;At the same time that players ares trying to find their objectives, the clock is ticking and they have only 10 rounds to prepare for the final battle against the bad guy....he has is hown character sheet that plays automatically against the players.&#10;&#10;Players must find their objectives and at the same time try to find out the villains hidden location in the factory for the final battle, if they fail to do this, even if the their objectives are met, the bad guy wins the game.&#10;&#10;THE STORY&#10;Our story takes place in a land called NUTRILAND, where food had enormous powers, called NUTRI-POWERS. People lived happily and had a healthy and balanced life. The big NUTRILAND FACTORY, managed by MURDOCH and a team of good nutritionists, led by NEUS, made &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;the processing and distribution of food to the entire population.&#10;ALEX GRAND, the terrible villain, seized control of his father&rsquo;s factory with the help of NOSE, a despicable bootlicker and his right arm, and subverted MURDOCH&rsquo;s dream using the Factory to produce and distribute GENEX-100, a caloric compound of his making.&#10;&#10;Before ALEX destroyed everything, NEUS instructed its seven most experienced nutritionists to flee, so that each one would preserve a food group. Thus they became Nutri-Masters and created the seven kingdoms of nutrition where even today they retain the foods that were entrusted to them and the secrets of their incredible NUTRI-POWERS.&#10;&#10;30 years later NUTRILAND became gray and entirely dominated by ALEX GRAND, which gave it a new name - GRANDLAND. The population forgot food over time and ALEX became an businessman adored by all and the GENEX-100 the only food available.&#10;&#10;Having realized ALEX&rsquo;s scheme, and having discovered the existence of food, TEO, LENA, BEN and NINA take on the exciting mission to discover the seven kingdoms of nutrition and restore food diversity to GRANDLAND.&#10;&#10;",

Players bid for control of one of six different ships on the board using a hidden bidding system that simultaneously determines how far that boat may move on that turn. The object is to pick up 'patients' in specific cities and deliver them to your own designated areas - but you have to be careful what you choose to carry because you may not be able to retain control of that boat on the next turn. Safely delivered patients reward players with varying amounts of dubloons and the player with the most dubloons at the end of the game (after there are no patients left in need of transport) is the winner.&#10;&#10;There is also a small deck of 'Arkel' cards which players can acquire during the game and use for different one-off effects such as movement bonuses or cash bonuses. The Arkel cards also include facts and anecdotes about the history of the Reinier van Arkel Group.&#10;&#10;",

During the very same day, a battle took place, the battle that after many years later became a symbol of clash of old cavalry formations with modern tank units. Poles from Wolynska Cavalry Brigade bravely resisted the German attack of 4th Panzer Division. Regardless of concentrated tank assaults supported with artillery and airstrikes, Germans hadn`t achieved their objectives. Defenders suffered heavy casualties but retained fighting capability and continued to fight in the days to come.&#10;&#10;Mokra, 1st September 1939 allows not only to recreate those events but also to check different hypothetical scenarios. Players decide about their forces` movement and they organize attacks or defense. Both sides enjoy certain advantages. Germans have large number of motorized units and strong air force. Poles need to make use of wooded terrain and an element of surprise - as Germans haven`t expected to encounter a such large cavalry formation in their way.&#10;&#10;Players use basic rules of &quot;Great Battles of Small Units&quot; system - the same one that was used in &quot;Primosole Bridge: 14-17th July 1943&quot;. The same mechanic are employed to represent a different battle of World War II. Few special rules were added to represent specific elements of that battle, like for example - an armored train &quot;&#197;&#154;mia&#197;&#130;y&quot; or German motorized infantry.&#10;&#10;",

Each turn, one person gets two cards with objects on them, then reveals one and keeps the other one hidden. That person is trying to get everyone else to guess the hidden object. The trick is that they can say only what is true about both objects. They can give unlimited hints and the other players have unlimited guesses. When someone guesses the hidden object, the guesser and the hint giver both get a card and the next play proceeds clockwise. The first player to get five cards wins the game.&#10;&#10;Let's say for example, that you drew an airplane and an apple. You could reveal the airplane and say both these objects are bigger than a strawberry, both these objects might be found in New York, both these could fall on scientists. Frame your hints to get your audience in the right mindset. This free-for-all mode of the game works best with 2 through 10 players.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "&euro;uro Crisis is a tactical as well as a satirical game for 3-4 players about the financial crisis in Europe. The players take the roles of banks with the goal of enriching themselves at the expense of the struggling states.&#10;&#10;One game lasts for three years, with each year divided into four quarters. In each quarter, all players choose their action simultaneously and resolve them in turn order. As an action you can borrow money from the European central bank just to lend it in another action to the struggling states. You'll get good interest rates, especially when the state is nearly broke! But always be aware of the possibility that a state might have to restructure its debts.&#10;&#10;From your earnings, you can buy gold and weapons. Gold is used to bid on privatizations of state property, which is the one thing that will truly be worth something at the end of the game. Your weapons can be used to defend your privatizations from an angry mob &mdash; or you can give them to decent citizens, just to see how the new privatization of another bank becomes public again. Last but not least, you have to be a good lobbyist to gain exactly the government or the reforms you want.&#10;&#10;In the end, the player with the most points wins. Beside the privatizations, mainly income, but also gold, weapons and money add a few points.&#10;&#10;&euro;uro Crisis is entertaining, with a lot of interaction and invites everyone to gamble with borrowed money &mdash; just like the euro crisis...&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Using the strategy associated with chess, and the complexity of an RPG, adventure through the world of Cathedr'l and conquer the realm of battle.&#10;&#10;Both sides have equal forces. Though, the pieces and their abilities, in addition to 20-sided dice (called action dice, or AD) are what makes this game maintain its role-playing aspect. Each character has the following attributes:&#10;&#10;Hitpoints: Ranging from 8 to 14. Based on the physical prowess of a character, the Hitpoints of the character can change. for example, the Sorcerer only has 8 hitpoints, while the Knight has 12 and the Warrior has 14.&#10;&#10;Armor Points: Ranging from 1 to 4. The difference between armor and health being that you can roll a D20 to try and negate damage as damage will always go to armor first.&#10;&#10;Accuracy: This is broken up into either melee, ranged, magic, or shield accuracy. You must roll equal to or higher than the indicated number. Rolling a 19 or 20 will cause a CRIT, usually causing double damage. When you have to hit your target you roll however many action dice your weapon allows. Refer to your accuracy, and if the dice you rolled are equal to or above your accuracy, you successfully hit.&#10;&#10;Weapons: Each character has some form of a melee weapon. Most characters will be able to cause either 4 or 6 total damage with their weapon. Though the way it is caused is different for every character. The knight with a flail rolls 1 action dice causing 6 damage. While the Crusader with his longsword rolls 6 action dice each causing only 1damage. The Cleric with his hand mace causes 4damage with 1 action dice, while the Sorcerer and their casting staff rolls 2 action dice each causing 2 damage.&#10;&#10;Movement: Movements between the characters vary based on their maneuverability and battlefield mobility. The ranger holds roots to the Bishop of Chess, allowing them to go as far as they want in a diagonal line. The knight is able to move in the classic 'L-move' associated with knights of Chess. Though when it comes to the Crusader (able to move up to 2 squares diagonally) or Assassin(able to move up to 2 squares in ANY direction) Cathedr'l takes on its own personality as characters must use their unique movement to navigate the battlefield.&#10;&#10;Spells: The Sorcerer, Cleric, and Paladin, utilize magic to support themselves and their allies in combat with powerful abilities only used by the select few magic users of Cathedr'l.&#10;&#10;Abilities: Abilities are what will allow certain characters their unique traits. The Warrior and his Charge ability allow him, like a pawn, to move up to 2 squares on his first movement. The Paladin with the ability of STED, has built extreme strength and endurance and has an extra Hitpoint that regenerates at the end of every turn, essentially ignoring 1 point of damage whenever he is hit.&#10;&#10;Using a system that is as deep and complex, as a tried and true RPG, and the unique strategy offered by chess, both players will use strategy and the role-playing aspect of a 20-sided Action Dice in order to outsmart and gain better positioning against their opponents. &#10;   &#10;   In order to beat the game, you must slay your opponents King AND Queen. After slaying either of the two 'royal' characters on your opponent's team, all of the their characters that started the game on their respective royal's side of the board, go into exile and are removed from play. This allows for another layer of strategy as slaying your opponents king or queen can leave your opponent at half strength and weak against your troops.&#10;&#10;",

Be cunning, be careful and explore the mystery of Skeleton Creek...&#10;&#10;The game starts with 4 cards being dealt to each player face down...one of the cards (placed randomly) is the Old Joe Bush card! At the start of every turn a player draws a card, they may then choose to play a card, but at the end of each turn a player may only have 4 cards in their hand. Each player must also leave their cards face down until it their turn. The game ends when the last card from the draw pile is taken. From there, each player (including the one that drew the last card) takes their last turn. The object of the game is to end with Old Joe Bush in your hand!&#10;&#10;Use Night Vision to peek at another player's hand. Use Ryan's Journal to take the top card off of a player's hand. There are countless possibilities and strategies to use to capture the Ghost of Old Joe Bush!!&#10;&#10;",

Anticipate your opponents' moves, and deliver the most stock in the quickest way possible. And, what&rsquo;s most important, fulfill trade contracts. Let your adversaries watch the sparks fly from under the wheels of your dashing train!&#10;&#10;Every turn in this game is divided into two phases. First is the planning phase, in which players plan their moves by playing move cards. Next is the action phase; this is the heart of the game. Players reveal their move cards one by one and perform actions (load cargo, deliver cargo, upgrade train, switch cargo order on the stations, pick up a new contract). There are many possibilities; players must choose wisely and plan ahead their moves. The gameboard is made from cards and players change it during the game.&#10;&#10;",

Each player is in command of forces in order to defend his race and expand the control in the universe. Three races (Numan, Slurr and Uthron, most commonly distinguished between humans, aliens and robots) fight for the galaxy on different battlefields: uncharted lands, seas of planets and in the cold space.&#10;The game's goal is destroying the opponent's &quot;headquarters&quot; by reducing to zero his command points (same as life points). To achieve this, players have 330 cards between units, supports and locations in order to build their own forces deck to use in battle against opponents, in the locations determined by each player. EverZone introduces a revolutionary game mechanism to minimize random elements, creating extremely tactical challenges.&#10;&#10;EverZone ist ein strategisches Kartenspiel, das in einer fernen Zukunft spielt. Jeder Spieler kontrolliert Truppen, um seine Spezies zu verteidigen und seine Kontrolle im Universum auszuweiten. Drei Rassen (Numan, Slurr und Uthron, gemeinhin auch erkannt als Menschen, Aliens und Roboter) k&auml;mpfen auf unterschiedlichen Schlachtfeldern um die Galaxie: unbekannte Lande, Planetenmeere, eiskalter Raum. &#10;Ziel des Spiels ist, das gegnerische Hauptquartier zu zerst&ouml;ren, indem dessen Kommandopunkte (analog zu Lebenspunkten) auf Null reduziert werden. Um das zu erreichen, baut jeder Spieler aus 330 Karten mit &quot;Units&quot;, &quot;Supports&quot; und &quot;Locations&quot; sein eigenes Deck, das er dann im Kampf gegen seine Gegner an den Schaupl&auml;tzen einsetzt, die von den Spielern bestimmt werden. Das Novum an EverZone sind Mechanismen, die die Spielstrategie auf h&ouml;chste Level anheben und den Zufallsfaktor auf ein Minimum reduzieren.&#10;&#10;",

Oh, and don't forget to grab the loot!&#10;&#10;Doom Tomb Tactics is a strategy-adventure game which pits one or two players against The Wretched, a dark and powerful force who has returned from the grave to strike fear into the hearts of the peaceful Onakwan people.&#10;&#10;Each player assumes the role of one of four classic characters, each with their own unique skills and abilities. Heroes traverse four different Levels, infiltrating Tombs in an attempt to slay the abominations within, and if successful, claim defeated Wretchs' Loot, which can later be used to purchase Artifacts including weapons, armor, and spells. During exploration and combat, Heroes spend Power Tokens to activate and resolve Artifacts and Special Abilities, and can also seek out Treasure, including more Loot and Power Tokens, but beware. Sometimes it's a Trap!&#10;&#10;Each level is constructed with four Maps. The first three of these maps are completely randomized, and contain various obstacles and enemies, while the last map contains the level's Tomb Boss. To accomplish their Quest, the Heroes of Onakwa must fight their way through these Forbidden Tombs and defeat all four Tomb Bosses, including the dreaded Zhakoros.&#10;&#10;",

After the fall of Mussolini and the declaration of war to Germany, Italy overthrew the course of the war. Playing Resistance you can choose to control the partisans, aiming to spread over the country to get consensus and support. Or you can step into the role of the Axis, trying to stifle resistance or discredit it.&#10;&#10;Resistance is a strategic light wargame with historical and political elements for 2 players, which assume the role of the forces of the Axis or the Partisans. The game map outlines the North of Italy, enclosed to the south by the Gothic Line.&#10;&#10;When playing Resistance you should give up concepts such as the &quot;front line&quot; and &quot;grouping military forces&quot;. On the opposite, Axis and partisan must aim to spread themselves all over the country: the Axis should try to surround and round up the enemies, while the partisan should try to exercise political control over the population.&#10;&#10;The Axis player controls a number of variable military units (about 20): the exact number depends by the political situation. The partesan player controls from 1 to 50 partesan units: the exact number dependes by the consensus coming from civilian population. The partesan player goal is to control the territory, in order to recruit more people than those dying each turn (which is inevitable). On average the partesan player should be able to recruit about 30-40 units of partesan fighters during a play, and lose about 10-20. This implies that the partesan ends the game with about 20 units. Since the Axis players has about the same number of units, the player having the number supremacy at the end of the play wins the game.&#10;&#10;Resistance is based on very light wargame concepts. The actual game engine is the struggle for getting control over territory and raising population support.&#10;&#10;",

Their goal is to transport photographs with a hot-air balloon at locations in the state to their towers (transmitting the scoop back to their news agencies). Each player starts with one photo card, and take turns to roll a die, moving their card by the die's result. They draw new photo cards on a &quot;6&quot;. The reporters can deploy Stop Stones to stop other reporters from moving through. The first reporter to transmit back three photographs wins the game.&#10;&#10;The second mode of the game is called Top Secret, which is played on the other side of the game board. The game takes place in the news agency and players are racing against time to dig out what the others know. Each player thinks up a secret word at the start. On their turn, they roll a die, move their marker by the result, and can ask another player for one letter of their word. Players get points for guessing another player's secret word. The game ends when one player's marker reaches the end point and the winner is the player who has the highest score.&#10;&#10;",

Players fight over Europe, across the North Atlantic and Mediterranean and into Russia using a combat mechanism similar to the traditional card game &ldquo;War&rdquo; with dice added in.  High-quality wooden pieces mark their progress, which is aided economically, politically and on the battlefield through the competition for and play of Event Cards drawn from three unique decks: one for the Axis, one for the Allies, and one from which either side can attempt to draw.&#10;&#10;Hitler&rsquo;s Reich is the first of the Card Conquest System game series in which players recreate epic military contests of history in short, comparatively simple and easy to learn, but hard to master games.  Designed to be set up in minutes and played to conclusion in one sitting, these are not simulations but games, albeit ones packed with enough historical flavor, excitement, and decision making to give you the feeling of being there at the highest levels of command.&#10;&#10;",

Three enormous altars situated on the island give power over all dimensions to those who take control of them.&#10;&#10;In Altaria: Clash of Dimensions, each player uses three of ten characters to try to capture all of the altars placed in the center of the game board or the portal that belongs to her opponent. The game consists of seven rounds, and each round is divided into three stages. In each stage, a player gets action points (APs) that are used for the skills of one character. With the help of these APs a player can relocate the character, attack the enemy, or place a unique token of power on the board. Each token can change the course of events in the game.&#10;&#10;The modular board has removable components that provide players with a number of starting combinations and make it possible to play a unique game from the very start.&#10;&#10;An interesting feature used in Altaria is the passing of the tokens of power. After a few stages of the game, they disappear from the board which makes the game more dynamic and constantly changes the situation on the board. Try to make the most of the skills of your characters, outwit your opponent, and be a better tactician.&#10;&#10;",

During the game, players play a card featuring a number between 1 and 8. As they do so, they instruct the next player (designated by them) to play a card that is &laquo;higher&raquo; or &laquo;lower&raquo; than the card they have just played. If the designated player cannot play a higher or lower card as called, the bomb explodes and the player is out of the game for the rest of the round. (Cards of identical value can be played.) When a player manages to play all the cards in his hand, he is safe for the rest of the round. The quicker the teams manage to get their players home safe, the greater their rewards.&#10;&#10;",

If it&rsquo;s a fight our enemies want, we&rsquo;ll pay them back in kind.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Welcome to 97 Cent Space Battle, where starships look suspiciously like coins and space combat is fought in two dimensions (unless the ships fall off the table).&#10;&#10;In this game you&rsquo;ll flip, flick, and spin your ships in an all-out assault on your opponent&rsquo;s HeadQuarter.&#10;&#10;The game itself is a free rules download. You'll need some table space and 97 cents for each player (1 quarter, 3 dimes, 6 nickels, and 12 pennies).&#10;&#10;97 Cent Space Battle is played in two phases. During the deploy phase, the fleets warp to the combat area. Players flip their coins onto the table. The outcome of each toss (heads or tails) determines whether the ship made a perfect warp and can activate immediately. Just flick your ship at an enemy to blow it up.&#10;&#10;During the assault phase, players take turns activating their surviving ships, until a player loses his Headquarter or his fleet is destroyed.&#10;&#10;",

A race to be the first to visit the Moon and return, players answer trivia questions about general science and the Apollo mission to move their golf tee pawns around the Moon and back to Earth. Progressive rules are provided to allow for play by novice astronauts.&#10;&#10;Publisher's Box-Back Description&#10;&#10;APOLLO is more than a game, it is an encyclopedic work devised to acquaint adults and young people with some of the fundamentals involved in a voyage to the Moon and facts about subjects such as geography, astronomy, units of measurement and practical physics.&#10;&#10;The principle of the game is for each player to pilot his Apollo spacecraft from Cape Kennedy to a landing on the Moon and return to the good Earth with a sample of the lunar surface.&#10;&#10;Dice are used to tell a player how far to move across the board on each play, providing he doesn't encounter a flight problem during a critical maneuver. There are 270 questions (with answers) which are used to overcome these problems. Typical maneuvers include landing on the Moon, re-docking the Lunar Module with the Command Module and Earth re-entry.&#10;&#10;The game will add useful information to each player's bank of knowledge whether he is a fourth or fifth grade student or a professional person in a technology. The unique design of the game allows persons of these different ages and experiences to play the game together with the same degree of challenge and interest for each player. This variable level of play allows the less experienced to progress as they become better acquainted with man's space accomplishments and other topics.&#10;&#10;We're sure you'll enjoy our approach to provide excitement and challenge with practical educational material.&#10;&#10;",

Many other questions involve bodily functions and are just meant to be gross, and a few are adult in that they challenge religious ideas or moral gray areas. Some of the questions are tame, and could easily have been adapted into the normal game. The age of the game has been raised from 12 &amp; up to 16 &amp; up. Otherwise the game plays like the normal version of Would You Rather...?.&#10;&#10;From the Box:&#10;&#10;In this sick, twisted, and wrong version you'll find questions that are nauseating, bizarre, and disturbing, but each is a field tested conversation starter that is guaranteed to provide ridiculous fun, break the ice at any party and--if played correctly--open a unique window into the twisted imaginations of friends and family!&#10;&#10;From the publisher:&#10;&#10;&quot;Zobmondo!! Would You Rather...? TSW comes in a square psychedelic (lava lamp patterned) box. It contains a game board and introduces Challenge Cards to make game play even more diverse and fun. This version has content that is more edgy than any of our other games. This is truly the new Twisted, Sick &amp; Wrong Version. As with the Original Zobmondo!! game, this game is not for the easily squeamish. It creates an outrageous, hilarious evening of fun by pushing the envelope.&quot;&#10;&#10;",
