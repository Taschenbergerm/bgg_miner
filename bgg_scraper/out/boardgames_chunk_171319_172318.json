        "description": "This two player trick-taking game combines elements of German Whist and Watten and offers scope for strategic play.  At the start of play, one player chooses a trump suit and another chooses &quot;supertrump,&quot; i.e. chooses a single rank of cards (two through Ace) that becomes part of the trump suit and beats all other trumps.&#10;&#10;The game is played in two stages.  After each of the first 13 tricks the players replenish their hands from a draw deck; each trick won at this stage counts for 1 point.  The second set of 13 tricks is then played out, with each trick won during this stage counting for 2 points.&#10;&#10;Detailed rules can be found in a forum posting below.&#10;&#10;",

In your turn you can ask any player for a card. If he has it, he passes it to the question player who can then ask for another card from the same or different players. When someone is asked for a card that he doesn't hold, the questioner's turn ends. Once sets of at least three cards are collected, they are laid face-down in front of the player, who may add to them during the rest of the game. The game ends when the last card has been played.

As a dissident, you win by playing your card to as many comrades as possible so that they may learn the secret word of freedom and vote for it.&#10;&#10;The game starts with one of the two words of freedom in play, &quot;glasnost&quot; or &quot;perestroika&quot;. Your hand consists of one card only that tells you your current role. The card is played through three distinct phases:&#10;&#10;1. Vote: Selected players vote secretly for or against freedom.&#10;&#10;2. Committee: If the vote says freedom, the selected players vote again but this time openly. If they succeed in identifying the word of freedom all except the informer win. If they fail, the dissident player is revealed and an easier target for the informer in the third phase.&#10;&#10;3. Interrogation: The players take turn to give or receive 1 card until all have 1 card again. The dissident tries to play his or her card to players who have not yet seen the card while the informer tries to play his or her card to the dissident.&#10;&#10;The players may never reveal their cards.&#10;&#10;The continuous change of roles makes the game unpredictable and keeps the players in uncertainty. A strong advocate of freedom one turn may suddenly be an informer the next.&#10;&#10;You must trust each other to successfully vote for freedom but you cannot trust anyone!&#10;&#10;",

You have a secret personal objective as well but anyone not following the party line may be purged.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, you score 1 point for each plan that was executed according to your objective but you also lose 1 point for each time you have been purged.&#10;&#10;The players take turns to play the general secretary and lead the turn through three distinct phases:&#10;&#10;1. Plan: The general secretary proposes one of the three ministries of defence, finance and security and calls for an open vote. The ministry approved by a majority of the members enters the execution phase.&#10;&#10;2. Execution: The general secretary appoints three members for a secret execution where they choose between repression and reforming.&#10;   a) If they are unanimous, the ministry adds 1 point for repression and subtracts 1 point for reforming.&#10;   b) If no unanimity is attained in three attempts, the ministry is unchanged and the three members enter the purge phase.&#10;&#10;3. Purge: The members secretly points out another member to purge.If a member is pointed out by the other two, he or she loses 1 influence.&#10;&#10;The players&rsquo; objectives may be related to the repression or reforming of one or more ministries or to the other members&rsquo; influence. They may coincide or collide.&#10;&#10;There is a delicate balance between pushing the common agenda towards your own agenda and avoiding the &quot;blame game&quot; that may follow. You need political alliances but your allies will take any opportunity to purge you!&#10;&#10;",

The usurper Pelias gave Aeson his word that when Jason will come of age, he will give crown and throne to the young prince, but that was a promise he did not intend to keep. When Jason, a young man now, confronted Pelias and asked him to honor his word, the usurper tasked Jason with a seemingly impossible quest to prove that he is worthy of the throne of Iolkos. He had to recover the Golden Fleece from the distant city of Kolchis. Jason accepted and sent word to famous heroes to aid him in his quest. Hercules, Orpheus, the brothers Kastor and Polydefkis, Laertes the father of Ulysses, were some of the 50 heroes who answered Jason&rsquo;s call and joined him in his noble quest on board the legendary ship &ldquo;Argo&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;Argonauts is a cooperative game that requires careful strategic planning and just a bit of luck, as even the best laid plans, can fall victim to the wrath of the Gods. The game&rsquo;s objectives are to acquire the Golden Fleece and return safely to Iolkos without losing Argo or too many members of her crew. Each player controls heroes that participated in the Argonaut campaign, each with his / her own set of skills and special abilities. Following the journey from the myth, the Argonauts must face mythical monsters like Scylla and Harybdis, Harpies, Sirens, the construct Talos and the dragon guarding the Fleece, not to mention the perilous journey full of lethal encounters with merciless pirates or having to weather destructive thunderstorms all the while making sure their cargo hold is well stocked with the necessary supplies for the journey to and from Kolchis and their ship sea-worthy.&#10;&#10;Each turn, the players must decide which of their characters will participate in the encounter they face, dealing with threats with either might or cunning and keeping in mind that these characters will be unavailable to face the next encounter due to exhaustion. But the Argonauts are not alone in their quest. The Gods occasionally take interest in their actions, either helping or hindering the progress of our heroes, laying careful plans to waste&hellip;&#10;&#10;",

These cards will let you modifiy your rolls, make different characters easier to abduct, let you mess with other people's ships, and numerous other effects.&#10;&#10;Characters have varying difficulties, representing how well you have to roll to abduct them. You start out with a 6 sided die, but you may buy larger dice with tech as the game progresses. Upon abducting a character, you may choose to brainwash them, netting you influence points, or you may choose to keep them contained to take advantage of their various effects.&#10;&#10;Each time a character is abducted, the threat level goes up, representing how aware the humans are of your shenanigans. As the threat gets higher, so to does the difficulty of the game, as the humans start to retaliate or protect themselves in different ways. The game ends once the threat reaches 100, where the humans are finally acutely aware of your presence and ready to retaliate. At that time, each player counts up their influence points, and the player with the most influence points wins!&#10;&#10;",

She then slaps the pie plate in the center of the table, after which all of the other players do so. Whoever slaps last gets a cake stamped on her hand, then players shuffle the cards for another round.&#10;&#10;As soon as one player has five stamps on her hand, the game ends and whoever has the fewest stamps wins.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, a player either draws a card from the deck and adds it to her hand, or she plays one card from her hand onto one or two cards already in play. When you cover a card already in play, the half of your card doing the covering must match the covered card in either number or color. If the card you play features an action symbol, that action takes effect immediately, skipping the next player's turn, changing the order of play, forcing the next player to draw cards, swapping hands with other players, and so on. As soon as a player's hand is empty, she wins.&#10;&#10;SOLOmino includes a variant that allows a player to play out of turn if she can play a card that matches a card in both color and number. When this happens, the player lays down the card as if it were her turn, then the next player in clockwise order takes the next turn.&#10;&#10;",

Place the five 1s in the center of the table, then shuffle the remaining cards and deal them out among the players, with each player forming a face-down draw pile. On a turn, a player first sees whether she can play the top card of her discard stack onto a pile in the center of the table (with numbers always being placed in ascending order) or on an opponent's discard pile (with both ascending and descending plays being valid). After this, the player draws her top card and plays it in a similar manner, if possible. If a player has a choice of location, she chooses as she wishes.&#10;&#10;If someone makes a mistake when playing a card, any opponent can shout &quot;Schlafm&uuml;tze&quot;, then all of the opponents give the top card of their deck to the player who goofed.&#10;&#10;If a player empties her draw deck, she flips over her discard stack at the start of her next turn. As soon as a player is out of cards, that player wins the game.&#10;&#10;Schlafm&uuml;tze is a slightly altered remake of a traditional card game, so no designer is credited for it.&#10;&#10;",

Game can be played in short amount of time or can be lengthy - you decide.&#10;Equipment: Game board, player pieces, sentence log, playing money, sentencing cards, appeal/parole cards and pair of dice.&#10;&#10;User Description:&#10;Roll and move game where players go along the outer track receiving money for various life events, but also are at risk of being convicted of various crimes. Cards from the &quot;Sentencing&quot; pile determine how long a player must go to jail (i.e. the inner track) or whether they have received probation. Various spaces on the inner track (each circuit around being one year) also earn you money and random card draws may win you appeals, probation, or an overturn of your conviction. Score sheets (&quot;Sentence log&quot;) allow players to keep track of all the crimes they've been convicted of and how much time they've served for each. According to the game rules, there is no set goal; players must agree on a length of time to play or an amount of money to reach first.&#10;&#10;The game is apparently intended as a criticism of the lenient &quot;revolving door&quot; of the U.S. criminal justice system, similar to &quot;Capital Punishment&quot; or &quot;Public Assistance.&quot; Although the game was made in 1995, it fails to take into account the then new but growing &quot;three strikes&quot; system in many states, as well as criminal court's tendency to impose harsher sentences on repeat offenders.&#10;&#10;",

The instruction book is filled with right-wing sarcasm -- the playing pieces represent various tropes like &quot;pork barrel&quot; etc. -- and the cards punish or benefit players (ala Community Chest and Chase) using hypothetical examples of pro-liberal or anti-conservative bias in the Federal government's bureaucracy.&#10;&#10;Around the board, players get appointed to various positions in the healthcare bureaucracy and suffer various illnesses.  Each &quot;position&quot; has two spaces to win appointments to (rather than purchasing like in Monopoly), and unlucky players who land on your department have to pay their healthcare fees to you.  Beware of getting caught in the inner circle of healthcare waiting periods!&#10;&#10;This game is similar in tone to Public Assistance or Capital Punishment, in both its conservative/Republican anger and its cringe-worthy cards and spaces.  &#10;&#10;&#10;",

Nine double-sided bomb tiles are placed to the side, and each bomb tile shows either a color or a symbol, but not both.&#10;&#10;Everyone plays simultaneously, with each player flipping her chips one by one, flipping chips in the center of the table one by one, and swapping one of her chips for one of the publicly available chips. As soon as all seven of a player's chips match one of the target bombs &mdash; say, by being all pink or all triangles or one of each color &mdash; that player yells &quot;Boom!&quot; She then identifies the matching bomb, places one of her chips aside as a one-point scoring marker, draws a new chip from the bag, then flips over that bomb before play resumes.&#10;&#10;If a player matches two bombs simultaneously &mdash; e.g., all blue and one of each symbol &mdash; she sets aside two tokens instead of one. If a players matches the Bubble Bomb, which calls for one of each color and one of each symbol, she claims the Bubble Bomb (even if another player claimed it earlier), then swaps all of her chips for seven in the middle of the table before play resumes; the Bubble Bomb is worth three points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;With four players, the game ends when the final chip is drawn from the bag and the player with the most points wins; with 2-3 players, the first player to collect nine points wins.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "My First Bohnanza serves as both an introduction to Bohnanza and as a children's game in its own right, with the goal of the game being the same as its parent: Have the most Talers at the end of play.&#10;&#10;As in the original Bohnanza, the game includes multiple types of beans, with each bean having a number on it to indicate how many copies are in the game as well as a &quot;beanometer&quot; at the bottom of the card to show you how many cards of this type you need to harvest in order to collect Talers. My First Bohnanza has simplified beanometers, with four types of beans having only a single exchange value &mdash; e.g., five Gemeine (common) beans get you one Taler &mdash; and six types of beans having two exchange values. Games with the youngest players (or newcomers to the Bohnanza universe) should use the single beanometer cards with the other cards forming a Taler stack.&#10;&#10;To play, each player gets five cards, which they lay in a face-up row, and a beanfield tile that shows spots for two types of beans. On a turn, a player must plant the first (leftmost) card in one of her fields and she can choose to plant a second. Players try to group cards of the same type in the same field, but they can cover beans of different types, if needed. The player then reveals two cards from the deck and either keeps them or trades them (and cards from her hand, if desired) for cards held by other players; all traded cards must be planted. To end her turn, the player draws three cards and adds them to her row.&#10;&#10;As soon as a player has the proper number of bean cards in order in one of her fields, she harvests them, placing these cards in the discard pile and collecting a Taler from the stack. If those cards covered beans of another type, she can then start building on those beans again. After going through the deck 1-3 times (depending on the number of players), the game ends and whoever has the most Talers wins.&#10;&#10;Once players have played My First Bohnanza a few times, you can swap the single beanometer cards for the double beanometer cards, which now gives players a choice of when to harvest. Subsequently, you can combine the two decks, which introduces the rule about using one of the bean cards to serve as the Taler (which adjusts the quantity of that type of bean in the deck). With additional plays, you can add in the remaining rules of Bohnanza, such as needing to harvest for no Talers when planting, paying for a third beanfield, keeping your cards in hand, and not being able to harvest a field with only one card.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Kakerlakak, a portable version of the identically named Kakerlakak, puts a cockroach in the kitchen once again, but this time you get to control the cockroach and try to move him to tasty treats while hoping that the cook stays out of sight.&#10;&#10;Each player has a &quot;treat stick&quot; that shows four treats that she must claim in order by moving the cockroach onto the appropriate space on the 6x6 game board. The trick, though, is that items of cutlery lie all over the floor, blocking your way to the treats along with the shelving units that stand in the middle of the floor. As in the original Kakerlakak, the cutlery items have a pivot in their center, and players can turn the cutlery during the game to open and close paths.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, she rolls the cutlery die, then moves the cockroach 2-3 spaces based on the number of pips showing, turning an indicated piece of cutlery before, during or after the move. She then rolls and moves again. Starting after her second move, an opponent rolls the cook die after each movement, and if the cook shows up, that player's turn is over and the dice pass left to the next players. Alternatively, if a player reaches her goal, her turn ends.&#10;&#10;The first player to reach all four of her food goals, then reach the hole in the kitchen floor wins.&#10;&#10;Kakerlakak includes action rules that speed up gameplay. The cockroach and cook players both roll simultaneously, with the cockroach player moving as quickly as possible because as soon as the fifth cook face is rolled, the turn is over. The winning condition remains the same.&#10;&#10;",

Through her cunning, and with the help of four magic objects, she attempts to escape her fate.&#10;&#10;The Maiden in the Forest is an 18-card solitaire game using only cards. The rules are contained within the 18 cards. The object of the game is to rotate, then turn over, each of the twelve tree cards from their blooming to dormant side. If you can do this before the end of the twelve clock cycles of day and night, you win your freedom.&#10;&#10;To begin, shuffle the twelve tree cards and place them in a ring like a clock face. All cards should have their blooming side revealed and the trunks should point towards the center of the ring. Each card also shows one of four objects. Place the maiden card inside the ring at the 12 o'clock position. Set the four object cards to one side. Each day, you perform two actions:&#10;&#10;1. Shuffle the four object cards and place them face down in a pile. Draw the top card and view the object shown therein. All tree cards with this object may not be touched by the player during this cycle of day and night.&#10;&#10;2. Take the remaining three object cards and use their actions to move, that is, to swap the positions of the tree cards allowed to be touched, keeping their current orientations. You may use these actions in any order and may use none, one, two, or all three of the actions as you choose to.&#10;&#10;Each night, you perform two actions:&#10;&#10;1. You may now rotate blossoming tree cards with matching colors or matching objects that you are allowed to touch this night. Cards are rotated so that their trunks point outward from the ring. Cards previously rotated can then be turned over so that their dormant side is showing. Cards must be rotated (either clockwise or counter-clockwise) or turned over to their dormant side in accordance with the three patterns on the other side of this card. You may use each of the patterns only once during this night, but you may use them in any order you choose.&#10;&#10;2. Move the maiden card one position in the ring clockwise to signal the end of this day and night and the beginning of a new turn.&#10;&#10;If you turn each of the twelve tree cards to their dormant side before the end of twelve clock cycles of day and night, you win.&#10;&#10;",

The general idea is that players go on gigs and accumulate a resume in the form of credits so that they eventually are qualified and ready to audition for their 'Big Break'. Booking this gig wins the game.&#10; Player take turns. Each turn has four phases. The first is an income phase, where players earn credits and/or money (except when in NYC, where they have to pay to live there). The second phase is an audition phase where they roll dice to see if they are cast in a gig. The third phase is a movement phase. The last phase the players either can play a 'bitter card' or they 'take class'. Playing a bitter card generally has a detrimental effect on another player. Taking class involves exchanging money and other resources to gain special advanced credits.&#10;&#10;Bitter cards are generally earned by failing to book auditions. Closing cards are earned by completing professional gigs. Specialty Credits are required to audition for more advanced gigs, such as Cruise Line and Bus 'N Truck. A player must possess all three specialty credits (acting, vocal, and dance) and must have 15 total credits or more to audition for their 'Big Break'. If a player fails this audition, he/she loses an advanced credit, a generic credit, and gains two bitter cards. Play continues until somebody books their 'Big Break'.&#10;&#10;A future expansion of My Big Break is planned which will contain the option to work for a Theme Park and a Dinner Theatre. Players will also be able to wait tables in NYC and take an agent there.&#10;&#10;",

The first player plays any card, then calls &quot;Higher&quot; or &quot;Lower&quot;; the next player must play an appropriate card or pass, laying down her cards and stepping out of the round. Instead of playing higher or lower, however, a player can play a card of the same value, saying &quot;Double up&quot;, which forces all subsequent players to also play a card of the same value.&#10;&#10;Two escape valves exist in the game: A player can always play a 7 &mdash; the large joker &mdash; no matter what was played previously, with this player calling out &quot;Higher&quot; or &quot;Lower&quot; as normal. A player can play a 1 &mdash; the small joker &mdash; no matter whether &quot;Higher&quot; or &quot;Lower&quot; was called, but a 1 can't be played on doubled cards; the 1 can itself be doubled, with only a 7 being able to break the doubling.&#10;&#10;As soon as all but one player have passed for the round, the round ends and the lone player still in the round receives one point for each played card. A round might also end by players running out of cards in hand, but the final card played in a round that ends this way cannot be a joker (unless a joker was also the next-to-last card). Once a round ends, players have the option to ditch their hand, after which everyone refills their hand to seven cards and a new round begins.&#10;&#10;The first player to have at least sixty points wins!&#10;&#10;",

The battle forms part of both the Hundred Years&rsquo; War and the Second War of Scottish Independence.&#10;&#10;The game is played over ten turns. Chronologically, a turn corresponds to about half an hour. At the end of the 10th turn the battle ends and the situation will be assessed using a scoring system. The resulting score will determine the outcome.&#10;&#10;Combat results are resolved by the rolling of two six-sided dice, with various modifiers applied as detailed in the rules. Different types of unit have different characteristics, with terrain affecting how far a unit can move, how easy it is to break and its ability to either engage in melee or attack using archery.&#10;&#10;",

If you slap the garlic first when someone else has a matching vampire, then you keep that player from advancing.&#10;&#10;If the exclamation mark shows up instead of a color, then what you do depends on the symbol: With the bat, you want to slap the garlic first to turn over or clear any one of your cards; with the moon, you can slap first to swap two cards held by other players; with the skull, you don't want to slap at all!&#10;&#10;Any time that you slap the garlic when you shouldn't, you must turn over one of your face down cards; if you have no face down cards, then you must add a new card to those you already have.&#10;&#10;Whoever first clears four coffins wins!&#10;&#10;",

It's a frantic race to the finish!&quot;&#10;&#10;In each round, a different player takes the role of the Road Builder, and all of the other players become Drivers. The Road Builder's goal is to lay down all of their tiles before a Driver can Exit the roadway. The Drivers are trying to exit from the roadway before any other Drivers, as well as before the Road Builder lays the last tile.&#10;&#10;The road tiles have special features, including tunnels (which allow the player to &quot;warp&quot; to any other tunnel space when landing on one by exact count), or the dreaded &quot;No Exit,&quot; which blocks the road.&#10;&#10;Recommended to play enough rounds so every player has a chance to be the Road Builder.

        "description": "In terms of its gameplay, Qwirkle Cards plays somewhat like Rummikub, with players laying down cards/tiles from their hand onto the table and possibly moving things around to create new sets.&#10;&#10;In more detail, players start with a hand of nine cards from the 108-card deck; each card shows a colored symbol, with each of the six symbols appearing three times in each of the six colors. Whoever has the most cards in hand of one symbol or one color (but without duplicates) starts the game by laying these cards face up on the table as a set. Players then take turns in clockwise order.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player must add at least one card to the table; if she can't, she draws nine new cards, shuffles her old hand into the deck, then plays. When she plays, she can play as many cards as she likes as long as they share a color or symbol. She can create a new set if she plays at least three cards or she can add her cards to existing sets (as long as she doesn't duplicate a color or symbol) or she can do both. On her turn, she can move cards from one set to another, possibly using these cards with cards that she plays in order to create a new set.&#10;&#10;The point of this gameplay is to create qwirkles, that is, a set of six cards that contains either each symbol in a single color or each color in a single symbol. When a player creates a qwirkle, she claims this set from the table. After a player's turn, she refills her hand to nine cards.&#10;&#10;The game continues until the deck runs out of cards. Each player then takes one final turn, including the one who took the final card, then whoever has claimed the most qwirkles wins!&#10;&#10;",

Each player controls two to five decks, each of which represents one ship in the fleet.&#10;&#10;Each card in a deck represents one system coming online. As the AI alerts the control crew to which systems are ready, power can be diverted, weapons reloaded, hardware destroyed, AI disrupted &mdash; all using a rules light system that is easy to understand but difficult to master.&#10;&#10;Each player attempts to use his ships to destroy his opponent's ships and be the last player remaining.&#10;&#10;In the distant future, mankind has spread across the stars of our galaxy.

Cryogenically preserved crew sleep for centuries, awaiting their awakening to the sound of klaxons as an enemy armada enters sensor range.&#10;&#10;Battle will be joined. Ships will be destroyed. Men may die. When the cryopod opens only one thing is certain: only one armada can survive.&#10;&#10;",

If you roll a number, you move your dragon clockwise exactly this many spaces; if you land on a green space, you then move forward two spaces, and if on a red space, you move back two spaces. If you roll a tailwind, you turn the windmill clockwise 1-3 spaces, pushing any dragons sitting at the front of that wind or riding on the clouds; if you roll a headwind, you turn it 1-3 spaces counterclockwise. (Once you've played a few times, you can use a second die that allows you to choose headwind or tailwind as you like, in addition to the distance that you move.)&#10;&#10;The first player to circle the island and land on or pass its starting space wins!&#10;&#10;",

The playing area starts with only a couple of jungle tiles in play: a cacao field and a small market; two jungle tiles are laid face up, and the remaining jungle tiles stacked as a draw pile.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, he places one of her worker tiles on the board adjacent to one or more jungle tiles already in play, then (if two worker tiles are next to an empty space) adds one of the jungle tiles to the playing area in this space. Her workers then get busy and deliver the results of their effort: If you placed workers next to a cacao field, you receive one or two cacao markers per worker; if they're next to a market, you can choose to sell one cacao marker per worker at the listed price; if next to a well, you receive water; if next to a temple, they stand and look good until the end of the game; and so on. He then refills her hand from her personal deck to three worker tiles.&#10;&#10;Once all players have used all of their worker tiles, the game ends. Players score (or lose) points based on their water supply, and each temple rewards whichever players sent the most workers to it. In the end, whoever has collected the most gold wins.&#10;&#10;",

The princess is placed on any tile to start.&#10;&#10;On a turn, any player rolls four dice: One of them shows which accessory the princess is looking for, the other three show numbers from 1 to 3 or an arrow. All players now look for a path from the princess to one of the matching accessory tiles, using the following rules: Each of the movement dice must be used to move the princess in a straight orthogonal line; an arrow lets you move the princess to the edge of the grid. At the end of the three moves, you must reach the accessory tile. The first player to find a solution calls out and demonstrates it, receiving one diamond if correct. If the path leads past one or more tiles with a treasure icon, there is a bonus diamond. If the path doesn't work out or leads past the flower pot, the player loses a diamond.&#10;&#10;The first player to collect five diamonds wins!&#10;&#10;",

Everyone sits around the game box, which has sixteen pockets (or landing spaces) in a 4x4 grid. When someone gives the signal, everyone starts launching their kiwi discs at the box, trying to land them in the pockets. If someone creates a 2x2 square of kiwis or a 1x4 row of kiwis in their color, they win the game instantly &mdash; so don't let them do this! Cover up their discs with yours, and keep shooting until all the kiwis have flown.&#10;&#10;If no one wins instantly, then each player claims any stacks in which their kiwi is on top, taking all of the kiwis that lie underneath their bird as well. Players then stack their tokens, and whoever has the tallest stack wins!&#10;&#10;",

They can see the numbers of all the other players, but unfortunately, they see only the back of their own display. Who will manage to figure out through deduction what is standing in front of them?&#10;&#10;In more detail, the game includes cards in six colors, with each color having numbers 0-7. One card of each color is randomly removed from play and returned to the box without anyone knowing the numbers on those cards. Each player then sets up a rack with one card of each color on it, but with the racks facing toward the other players so that no one sees the numbers on their own rack. (In a game with two or three players, set up two or one additional racks visible to all players.)&#10;&#10;On a round, the active player rolls the three color dice, e.g., blue, red, and yellow. Each player tries to guess what the sum of the numbers on their rack is for the cards that correspond to the die colors. If the dice showed two green and one grey, for example, you'd add the green number twice and the grey number once &mdash; but of course you can't see what your numbers are; you can only see what they aren't based on what's showing in the racks visible to you.&#10;&#10;The active player then takes one of the bid strips &mdash; seven cardboard strips that come in different lengths &mdash; and places it across one or more numbers on the number line in front of them to show the range in which their sum lies, e.g., 13-16. Each other player does the same, choosing from the strips not previously chosen. If you guess correctly, you score points, with shorter strips being worth more points; if you're wrong, then you must discard any one of your colored cards face up, then draw a new card of this color and place it in your rack unseen. You now see this hidden number, which may help you deduce sums from previous rounds, but now you have to start over with you deductions for that color! Other players see the new card you just placed, so they get more info, too.&#10;&#10;After 8-10 rounds, depending on the number of players, each player guesses the numbers on their racks, writing down one, two, or three guesses for each color. If you guess correctly, you score 5, 2, or 1 points for a color based on how many guesses you wrote. Add these points to whatever you scored previously, and whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Ausgerechnet Fernweh uses the same game play as the other Ausgerechnet titles: Players deal three piles of 15 location cards from a deck of roughly 200 cards (naming locations related to Hamburg for this edition), then place an interlude card between each set of piles to make a deck of 45 cards. One location card is placed on the direction board, which has arrows pointing north, south, east and west.&#10;&#10;During a turn, a player draws a location card &ndash; keeping the latitude and longitude on the back of the card secret from all players &ndash; then places the card next to the direction board, indicating how he/she thinks this location relates to the starting one. Is L&uuml;neburg west or east of Blankenese? Why sure, so place it by the west arrow. Location cards can be placed between cards already on the board.&#10;&#10;After each location card is placed, any player can challenge the positioning of that card. That player reveals the back of the most recently placed card as well as one adjacent card. If the challenge was correct &ndash; and the card placed wrongly &ndash; the challenger wins a point chip from the placer and the card is removed; otherwise the challenger hands over a chip to that person.&#10;&#10;After fifteen cards have been placed, the interlude card signals an interim scoring in which all players secretly guess how many cards have been placed correctly. Guess correctly, and you score two chips; if no one is spot on, the closest guesser wins a chip.&#10;&#10;After three rounds and the final interlude scoring, the player with the most chips wins.&#10;&#10;",

Remember them well, because only then you can help the monkey to end the chaos!&#10;&#10;Der verdrehte Sprach-Zoo (The Twisted Language Zoo) is played in two phases. During the game, players take turns drawing two tokens: one animal, and one object. The player has to come up with a story of what has happened with that animal and that object. For example, when a player draws &quot;snake&quot; and &quot;balloon&quot;, he can say &quot;the snake has found a balloon in a tree, and uses it to fly away&quot;.&#10;&#10;When there is a story about each animal, the second phase of the game starts. Now, the players take turns remembering the stories. On his turn, a player draws an animal card. He has to remember what object was connected to that animal. The other players may give hints. If the player gives the right answer, he may move the monkey one space on the score track.&#10;&#10;The players win together if the monkey reaches the last space of the score track (the tree). If they run out of cards before the monkey reaches that last space, they lose together.&#10;&#10;The game comes with a mechanized gameboard for hiding and revealing the answers, and several rules variants.&#10;&#10;",

Some action cards allow players to swap identities, stumble players, nullify effects and even changing the scenario of the game.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each game which is the revealing phase, each player is dealt with 3 Item cards which work as identities. Similar matched identities creates clan which introduce the leader system. Dominant leaders have higher abilities than any player in the game where they have the ability to use their member's cards which is the key to securing the outcasts. Ranks of each player plays the role of power and defence. Ranks are given to those who are worthy of becoming a leader.&#10;&#10;In this game there is the Item Deck and the Action Deck. When the game starts, each player is given a choice to choose either drawing an Item card or an Action card. Then the player can either keep those cards or use the Action cards. For every player can only hold up to 3 cards in-hand, it forces players to a good challenge of planning and execution among members. This also leads to multiple strategic ways of winning the game. Backstabbing betrays can happen and so does denouncing friendships for a game! As much as sabotaging is a prominent factor of the game, it is also a heavy cooperative game that fosters communication among players.&#10;&#10;After a number of clan members is reached, the game ends with a rank comparison with the outcasts and the dominant leader. The highest rank holder wins the game. With a draw as a result, the dominant team takes the victory.&#10;&#10;Dominant Clan is currently in the process of publishing and is estimated to be released in late 2015.&#10;One of the first modern European card games designed by a Malaysian.&#10;&#10;",

All multiples of 10 are colored in black. Fields 35, 56 and 68 show hurdles, field 77 a water jump. In clockwise order, players roll one die and move their horses forward accordingly. If a horse stops on a black field, the player loses one turn. On a hurdle the player looses two turns, on the water jump he's out of the game. The player who first reaches field 100 is the winner. If he however exceeds 100, he has to move back the exceeding number of steps.&#10;&#10;A betting mechanism is built into the game: Each player has to pay 10 or 20 units to enter the game. Losing a turn costs 2 units, loosing two turns 3 units. Dropping out of the game costs 10. The winner takes it all.&#10;&#10;German rules:&#10;1.

Jeder Spieler bekommt einen Reiter und setzt denselben der Reihe nach mit den Vorderf&uuml;&szlig;en zwischen die 2 Linien Nr. 1, dann wird gew&uuml;rfelt und wer das meiste wirft, beginnt das Spiel und setzt immer den Reiter mit den Vorderf&uuml;&szlig;en in den Raum der gew&uuml;rfelten Nummer. Wirft jemand einen Zehner, z.B. 10, 20, 30, so zahlt er 2 Marken in die Kassa und darf einmal nicht w&uuml;rfeln.&#10;2. Kommt jemand auf ein Hindernis, so bleibt er auf seinem Platze, darf 2 mal nicht w&uuml;rfeln und zahlt 3 Marken in die Kassa, hat aber jemand das Ungl&uuml;ck und f&auml;llt ins Wasser, so hat er 10 Marken zu zahlen und mu&szlig; vom Spiele austreten. Wer Zuerst die h&ouml;chste Nummer erreicht hat, gewinnt das Spiel; wenn er aber dar&uuml;ber hinaus kommt, mu&szlig; er um soviel Augen wieder zur&uuml;ck als er geworfen hat.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "With Tour du Jour you can organize one-day classics or your own multi-stage tour! Use a single racer or a team consisting of a maximum of four members. Whether you enjoy hills or mountains, cobblestones or coastal roads, Tour du Jour has it all. Find out how your team holds up under the onslaught of the gruesome secteurs pav&eacute;s of Mons-en-P&eacute;v&egrave;le or Trouee d'Arenberg and brutal c&ocirc;tes such as the Kapelmuur and Oude-Kwaremont. Prefer long or short or false flat stages? It's all up to you. Mountain top finishes? Check out the tiles for 3 infamous climbs: L'Alpe d'Huez (France), Alto de l'Angliru (Spain), and Plan di Montecampione (Italy). Rain? Snow? Got it covered. Labyrinthine, narrow city streets, complete with 90 degree turns, nasty road furniture that pops up unexpectedly? Tour du Jour has that as well. There's no end to the possible configurations: this versatile game contains enough tiles to lay out any type of race and blast off.&#10;&#10;The gamebox itself&mdash;containing 6 teams of 4 racers, game token holders, a set of 40 cards, 45 terrain tiles, and a 20-sided die&mdash;has been reduced in size and weight in order to save on shipping charges.  Less box, more game!&#10;&#10;The course is laid out from the terrain tiles each of which has a number indicating its degree of difficulty.  On a player's turn, they roll a die and if the die roll is higher than the difficulty, the player may advance.  If there are still unused pips to cover the degree of difficulty of the next time, the player may advance another tile until all the pips are used up (or insufficient pips remain to advance a tile.)  Unused pips are tracked and carried over to the next turn.&#10;&#10;The cards are event cards which are drawn at the end of a turn.  Most are blank (no effect), the rest contain an event (usually bad, but not always) that impacts the race.&#10;&#10;For a single race, the winner is the first to cross the finish line while for multi-stage races, the lowest aggregate score (aka time) is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

She ha brought sparkling crystals, which they generously hands out in the magic Papillia garden.&#10;&#10;To reach all Fillies, the princess travels from place to place. With a little luck of the dice and courage to some take risks you can get hold of a lot of colorful glitter stones. Here we go!&#10;&#10;In Filly Butterfly: Sammle deine Funkelsteine (Filly Butterfly: Collect your Glitter Stones), each player attempts to collect as many crystals as possible.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, all players receive the same amount of crystals.&#10;&#10;The board shows six locations in Papillia; each location has some spaces for crystals. A Princess Scarlet pawn is placed on one of the location.&#10;&#10;Players take turns rolling the die and moving Princess Scarlet a number of spaces clockwise, as indicated on the die. If Princess Scarlet ends her move in a location that still has an empty spot for a crystal, the active player has to place one of his crystals there, and may then roll the die again, if desired. On the other hand, if Princess Scarlet ends her move on a location that has no more empty spots, the active player may take all crystals from that location, and his turn ends.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player has no more crystals left. Then, the player who has collected the most crystals wins.&#10;&#10;",

After a long and grueling journey that led through Jerusalem and Mesopotamia and over the &quot;Silk Road&quot;, they reached the court of Kublai Khan in 1275.&#10;&#10;In The Voyages of Marco Polo, players recreate this journey, with each player having a different character from history with a special power in the game. The game is played over five rounds. Each round, the players roll their five personal dice and can perform one action each turn with them. Each action requires the use of one or more dice, and can be collecting resources or money, acquiring contracts or traveling on the board. When traveling, each player begins at Venice and can decide between several routes eastward, all the way to Beijing. When a player stops at a city, they place a trading post there, giving them access to extra actions or resources for the rest of the game. The higher the value of the dice used for an action, the better the options that may be chosen, but also the more money the player must pay if an opponent has already chosen the same action.&#10;&#10;After five rounds, the game ends with players receiving extra victory points for having trading posts in Beijing, fulfilling the most orders, and having trading posts in the cities on secret city cards that each player gets at the start of the game.&#10;&#10;This game should not be confused with Marco Polo Expedition, which has the same German title.&#10;&#10;",

When a player reaches the carrot, he wins the game.&#10;&#10;The spinner has some other outcomes as well, allowing the player to cover a hole (uncovering another one), moving a bridge (which allows for shortcuts) or pushing another player backwards using the mole.&#10;&#10;",

The board tiles are double sided, and you can lay them out in a variety of ways to build your town your way.&#10;&#10;Form your Posse - Bad Lands is a co-op survival game for 1-4 players. While most players will just control 1 Hero per game, you can still quite easily have a larger posse. The more Heroes in the adventure, the more Villains you will have to face, and the tougher the game will be.&#10;&#10;Kill Some Bad Guys - Bad Lands features a whole host of vicious Skinwalkers and minion beasts for your Heroes to vanquish. The core boxed game comes with a deck of 30 Encounter Cards. You draw a card, and it tells you what Villains are going to jump out and attack the Heroes.&#10;&#10;Get some Loot! - Of course, no adventure is complete without cool rewards. When you defeat tough Villains, they will leave a Loot Marker behind. If your Hero picks one up, you can draw a Loot Card from the deck. Each Hero may carry an unimited amount of Loot Cards, but may only equip and use two.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;You have been caught looting the hoard of the dreaded Drakon. For such transgression, a fiery death should be the only appropriate response &mdash; but Drakon has decided to toy with you before she devours you. You and your rival heroes will each be released into the labyrinth, and the first hero to discover ten gold pieces will go free with his treasure. The rest of you will satisfy the dragon's hunger.&#10;&#10;In every game of Drakon, you and your opponents must fight to stay alive in the midst of the labyrinth. On your turn, you can either move your hero to another room, or add another piece to the labyrinth, placing beneficial chambers in your own path and throwing your opponents into harm's way. But you must be cautious. The chambers of Drakon's labyrinth are filled with danger and ancient magics, not to mention the dragon herself. To navigate these deadly corridors and survive, you&rsquo;ll need to be quick and careful.&#10;&#10;On every turn, you have a crucial choice to make. You can either move forward into a new chamber, or you can expand the labyrinth by playing a new chamber tile from your hand. The new chambers that you play feature unique circumstances and magical objects that you may encounter on your adventures through Drakon's lair.&#10;&#10;The majority of these chambers offer powerful effects to any hero that enters the chamber. You may gain the power to destroy any chamber in the labyrinth, or call a windstorm to carry you along, increasing your movement. You may even take command of a floating chamber and fly it to the other side of the labyrinth. Other chambers force more harmful effects on those heroes unlucky enough to enter. A room may cause you to lose a coin as you avoid the dangers within, and any hero who hears the siren song of the magical harp is forced to move into its chamber. As you and your fellow heroes play these chambers from your hand, they form a cunning maze, and only the wise can find their way out.&#10;&#10;Despite the power of these chambers, the central goal of your quest is to find gold: only by being the first player to claim ten gold can you escape the dungeon. Plenty of chambers allow you to find a coin or steal a coin from an opponent, but the gold value of coins can vary dramatically. Your most recently stolen coin may have a value of three gold or just one. Because coins are kept face-down, hiding their value, you'll never know exactly how close your opponents are to victory.&#10;&#10;Six heroes are trapped within Drakon's sadistic labyrinth, and each hero has his own unique abilities to help him survive. Each ability can only be used once per game though, making the timing of the ability incredibly important. You may play as the sorceress and escape from a most dire situation by passing through a wall. You may play as the thief and collect the gold you need at the most opportune moment by preying on another hero. You may even play as the ranger and use a burst of speed to race across the maze when necessary. No matter which hero you play in a game of Drakon, you'll need to take full advantage of your unique ability at the opportune moment if you want to grab the gold and escape from Drakon's clutches.&#10;&#10;Of course, the heroes are not alone in the labyrinth. The legendary dragon also stalks the halls and chambers of the maze, taunting any hero unlucky enough to encounter her. Certain chambers throughout the labyrinth allow you to move Drakon through the dungeon. If you can move Drakon into the same chamber as a hapless hero, that hero is immediately sent back to the entrance chamber and loses three coins, as Drakon toys with him before releasing him once more into the maze.&#10;&#10;You and your rival heroes are trapped. Your greatest threat may be Drakon or the other heroes. In this dark labyrinth, only one thing can save you: your own greed. Will you ruthlessly grab gold and undermine your opponent&rsquo;s schemes before escaping to victory? Or will you fail and become just another meal for the dragon? You decide your fate, but only one hero can escape from Drakon!&#10;&#10;",

(Players will not all have the same number of cards.)  Each player arranges his hand and lays down any pairs he has been dealt.&#10;&#10;Player to the dealer's left begins by drawing a card from the dealer's hand.  If he can make a pair, he lays them down.  Play then moves clockwise, the player on the left taking a card from the player on his right.  The game continues until all the cards have been paired.  If a player has used all his cards he waits until his opponents have played all of theirs.  The first player to use all his cards receives a bonus of five points, but his pairs can still be captured.&#10;&#10;Using the points on each card the scores are then added up and recorded.  The first player to reach a score of 50 or the player with the highest score over 50 is the winner.&#10;&#10;A Superman card has no value alone.  However, it can be used to (a) cancel out a pair of minus cards, (b) capture an opponents pair, (c) protect one of the player's own pairs.  It is placed on top of the pair it has captured, cancelled out, or protected from being captured.  Players must wait their turn before using a Superman card.  After playing the Superman card they also draw from the player on their right.  Once a Superman card is used it cannot be used again.&#10;&#10;",

The game is player in four phases, each a simple mini-game with different rules, but each building where the other left off. Each phase is roughly ten turns per player. The four phases relate to various godly activities:&#10;&#10;Creation - The gods build the game world, using a tile placement mechanism. Each god will place ten, and score points based on number of edges connected and terrain features completed.&#10;&#10;Population - Each god has 40 tribes to competitively place on the board, usually 3-5 at a time. The finger of god touches an origin square, and life spreads from it. Terrain features limit how many tribes can fit in an area. Points are scored based on how terrain is filled. This phase feels a little like Go.&#10;&#10;Construction - With the world populated, the gods migrate tribes together. When enough are in a square, they build a temple to whichever god has a majority in their stack, and leave the board. Rival tribes are captured and converted by this process.  Points are scored by using tribes to build temples, and by converting rivals' tribes. This feels vaguely like the city building mechanic from Civilization (original).&#10;&#10;War! - The world is now full of temples. The gods each have a monster and a hero to summon from their temples on their turn. Monsters seek to defile rival temples, making them more difficult to summon from. Heroes go to fight rival heroes and monsters, or just vandalize a rival temple. Points are scored for slaying, defiling and robbing. This phase can feel like the endgame of Chess.&#10;&#10;Each phase has a method of earning bonus points. At the end of the last phase, the gods total their scores to determine a winner.&#10;&#10;",

Assign your women for teaching your children vocabulary, leading to cognitive fluidity in the next generation and to a tribalistic culture. Specialize your elders for fire, war, big game, inventions, or animal domestications. Choose between three mating strategies: promiscuous, harems, or pair bonding. Victory depends on which strategy you choose, and may include your hunters, elders, women, vocabulary, trophies, inventions, or domesticated animals.&#10;&#10;At this point, the players have developed to the point where the companion game Greenland begins, so you can flow one game into another seamlessly.&#10;&#10;",

Then, going around the table, players must either play a card in their hand or back out of the mission. Each card represents either threats to the team (such as mortar shells and weather conditions) or negative personality traits (such as frightened or obsessive). At the end of the round, more cards are added to the draw deck. The game ends only if the players can deplete the draw deck as well as their hands without letting time run out.&#10;&#10;If one threat shows up too many times, the team fails the mission. The team must play their threats correctly in order to gain any progress. However, most of the information in a players hand remains secret throughout the game.&#10;&#10;Planning, teamwork, and a little luck are the tools you'll need to win this cooperative game for two to five players.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Why First? is a racing game in which players vie to be second in order to win.&#10;&#10;The game lasts five races, with each race lasting five turns. At the start of each race, players receive a hand of five cards, with each card bearing a value from -4 to +5. The players' pawns start each race on 0 of the racing track. Each turn, players choose a card from their hands and choose which pawn to move with this card, then reveal them simultaneously and move the selected pawns forward or backward based on the cards they played.&#10;&#10;After five turns, the race ends and the player in second place on the racing track wins, scoring a number of points equal to his position on the race track. All other players score nothing. (If the winner is in the negative portion of the racing track, he loses points instead.) After five races, sum all of the points scored; the player with the second highest total who has won at least one race wins.&#10;&#10;This revised version of Why First? has new rules, including simultaneous actions by players that cuts down the playing time from the original release.&#10;&#10;",

The goal of the game is to tip the folded boy card so that it leans on the girl standee card, without the latter tipping. If the player succeeds, he gains 1 point. If the girl card tips, or the boy card doesn't lean on the girl card, the player scores &ndash;1 points. If he refuses to try, he scores nothing.

        "description": "Head Honcho is an introductory level mini-game on air combat set during the early years of the Korean War. The game is designed by Paul Rohrbaugh, with graphics by Bruce Yearian, and is published by High Flying Dice Games.&#10;&#10;Head Honcho: Jet Combat over the Yalu is also the Consimworld Donation Drive Gold Level game for 2015. Head Honcho features such aircraft as the F-86, the F-84, F9F Panther and other aircraft of the war, all battling the Communist MiG-15s for air supremacy.&#10;&#10;Head Honcho is not meant to be the most accurate of air warfare simulations. Rather, players should find this an entertaining diversion that still captures the &ldquo;essence&rdquo; of the violent and tense nature of Korean War jet combat. Similar to other minigames using this design (Dueling Eagles, Fighting Eagles), I also hope Head Honcho serves as a vehicle by which newcomers to the hobby of simulation gaming can be introduced.&#10;&#10;",

The game uses simple mechanics with a highly interactive turn sequence that keeps gamers engaged for a fast, fun, and furious 2 to 2.5 hours of play.  The game units are blocks with labels and a low unit density on board means the game does not bog down. The core rules are 4 pages expanded to 8 with detailed graphics and explanations meaning you can be up and playing with 15 minutes of rules reading and a short set up.&#10;&#10;Korea is called America&rsquo;s &ldquo;forgotten war&rdquo;. There are very few games on the topic, and none quite like this. The US Army, US Marine Corp, ROK Army, NKPA, and CPA forces are all represented. Air power, armor, and the Naval might of the UN forces are represented simply and elegantly. Rail movement, amphibious landings, and surprise attacks are in here too. Can you as the NKPA take Seoul and Pusan before the might of the US led UN forces get too strong? Will you as the UN player be able to blitz into N. Korea securing the Yalu River before Chinese forces come pouring across like a blizzard from the north? And as a last resort can you secure more enemy territory to control across the 38th Parallel as the peace makers negotiate the end of the war? The decisions are yours!&#10;&#10;",

They move around shooting and cutting through waves of aliens blocking their advance while at the same time trying to complete objectives that will bring them to victory.&#10;&#10;The game consists of a number of real-time 2-minute rounds (depending on the scenario) separated by an AI Alien Phase where aliens perform abilities, advance towards their goal and receive reinforcements.&#10;&#10;The constant performance of actions through dice rolling combined with an innovative combat/movement system result in a mix of intense gameplay that offers countless hours of fun.&#10;&#10;What really makes Project: ELITE unique is the &quot;Alien Move&quot; symbol that appears on one side of each of the player's dice and forces him/her to move an alien towards their goal.&#10;&#10;The end result is a real-time tactical board game where friend and foe are in constant motion, trying to prevail over the other.&#10;&#10;",

        "name": "Lion of Judah: The War for Ethiopia, 1935-1941",
        "description": "Lion of Judah: The War for Ethiopia, 1935-1941 is a two-player wargame simulating two campaigns located in the Horn of Africa - Italy vs. Ethiopia in 1935-1936, and the British Commonwealth and Ethiopia vs. Italy in 1940-1941. The scenarios use a common rule set combined with scenario-specific rules. Regular units are mostly divisions, brigades and regiments, while irregular units include warrior levies and tribal bands. Armor, transports, air power, and headquarters (which represent corps-level artillery assets, engineers, and administrative and command centers) are also represented. Lion of Judah has one large-hex map and approximately 400 counters representing Italian, Ethiopian, Commonwealth, French and German units.  In addition to the military units, there are markers to track game and unit status, as well as several Random Event markers used in the historical scenarios for added historical flavor.&#10;&#10;Colonial Warfare in Unforgiving Conditions.&#10;The campaigns for Ethiopia were fought in extremely inhospitable terrain. Logistics was one of the key issues of these battles. This is simulated in Lion of Judah by supply counters: everything a modern army requires to operate, from replacements to ammunition to artillery, has to be moved across the harsh terrain. Western units have far more firepower that the Ethiopians, but much lower movement rates. This simulates the &ldquo;safe&rdquo; rate of movement for western units when moving across difficult terrain. They had to move through jungles, mountains and marshes, relying on local guides to move through this mostly-unmapped terrain.  Supplies often had to go by air due to lack of a road network. Western forces may attempt to move at a more &ldquo;normal&rdquo; movement rate (using the &ldquo;Forced march&rdquo; table), but this entails risks: units may get lost, run out of supply, lose their pack mules, or even be ambushed. Unlike the Italians, the Ethiopian army of 1935 was a medieval-style collection of warriors, with little or no central command. This is simulated through activation rules: Ethiopian forces are activated randomly, and some may end up not activating at all during an entire turn! The Italian player may also &ldquo;bribe&rdquo; certain Ethiopian formations into inactivity, as they did historically.&#10;&#10;Conventional and Guerrilla Warfare.&#10;Both historical campaigns, have conventional and unconventional warfare. In 1935-36, the Ethiopian army engaged a conventional Italian army in the north and south, while at the same time fighting rebels and tribal guerrillas in the far off corners of the Empire. In 1940-41, it was the Italian Army who had to face both a conventional, professional enemy (the Commonwealth forces) and Ethiopian guerrillas and Commonwealth special forces operating in its rear.&#10;To win, players must successfully manage both kinds of warfare, guerrilla and conventional. When invading Ethiopia in 1935-36, the Italian player must invest resources to encourage trouble within the Ethiopian Empire, recruiting irregulars, bribing and encouraging rebellions. If the Italian player concentrates exclusively on the conventional military front, then the Ethiopian Empire will have a chance to concentrate its armies and achieve a resounding, glorious Adowa-like victory over the Italian invaders.&#10;&#10;Similarly, in the 1940-41 campaign the Commonwealth/Ethiopian player must raise rebel forces to force the Italian player to use desperately needed units to defend their lines of communications and cities. Furthermore, the Italian player has an 'Italian Prestige Index', which determines the chance of internal revolts.  He must attack British held territories and outposts as much as possible to keep his Prestige high, especially early in the game before the full might of the Commonwealth army can be brought to bear. The uncertainty regarding Italian defeats in Libya  (handled via event chits) adds further randomness as it is not guaranteed that the British and Indian units that were historically available in January 1941 will arrive in time for the Allied counteroffensive in Ethiopia.&#10;&#10;Diplomacy and other Chrome&#10;A random events system similar to that used in The Spanish Civil War 1936-1939 accounts for political and diplomatic events, rebellions in the rear, the arrival of combat units, the purchase of foreign weapons (in the 1935-1936 Scenario) or the arrival of blockade runners to Italian East Africa. Pressure exerted by various political actors is also simulated through events chits: for instance, the event &ldquo;Pressure by Mussolini&rdquo; (1935-36 Scenario), simulates pressure from il Duce when he demanded a rapid advance on to Addis Ababa before he lost the favorable international situation. The Italian player may use chemical weapons, but at the risk of losing Italian Victory Points if the &ldquo;League of Nations&rdquo; event is pulled that turn.&#10;&#10;Special units and rules cover the above mentioned Italian chemical warfare, as well as road building, supply dumps, Italian fuel and ammo shortages (1940-1941 scenario), open cities, the Red Sea Flotilla and blockade runners. The countersheet includes exotic units, such as the Somali Camel Corps, the Italo-German motorized company (a German volunteer unit that was recruited among German refugees from Kenya and crews of interned German ships), and Mission 101 or Gideon Force (Orde Wingate&rsquo;s guerrilla force operating in the Italian rear).&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Mahou Sh&#197;&#141;jo, meaning Magical Girl, is a turn-based paper card game based off the anime genre with the same name. Two players face off against each other in sparkling combat in order to defeat the other and capture their gems so that their rival cannot transform. Decks span from a number of themes including Nightmares, Daydreams, Sweets, Flowers, the Constellations, and even in the Internet. Playtime is under 20 minutes, which is more than enough time to show your rivals what true (sparkling) pain is.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is score three of your rival's gems. Gems are gained when a RIval's Magical Girl's HP reaches zero. To do this, players using a series of spells and abilities (and sometimes a little roleplaying) must engage in battle. As battle is happening, Magical Girls have a limited supply of magic they are able to use. If their magic is drained to zero before their hit points are, they are safe from being defeated. Some Magical Girls will be able to become Grand Magical Girls, which are very powerful for only a short amount of time. The game ends to be short but action packed.&#10;&#10;",

(The weather reduced flight operations considerably.)&#10;&#10;The surrounding of the German 6th Army in Stalingrad had happened, and in the game von Kluge must try to (irretrievably) withdraw as many panzer divisions as possible to send to Stalingrad, while stopping Zhukov's attempt to retake Rzhev and erase the salient it was in.&#10;&#10;The Russians get points for any victory point cities they take, for clearing out German defense zones along the front line, and for eliminating German units, outright or in exchanges.&#10;&#10;This heretofore little-known battle was the subject of Col. (rtd.) David Glantz's revelatory book, Zhukov's Greatest Defeat.  Historically, the Russians took horrendous casualties and achieved little, other than preventing panzer divisions from being transferred south, to try to help save 6th Army surrounded in Stalingrad.&#10;&#10;",

In level one, players roll five &quot;money dice,&quot; (which have the names and values of US coins on each side, as well as an X, indicating no money). They then take the indicated plastic coins from the tray.  Next, they may choose to roll as many dice as they wish that did not come up with Xs a second time, and take the indicated coins.  They may then do so a third time. The goal is to get a total as close to one dollar as possible without going over. After each player has rolled, the player closest to $1 wins. Five rounds are played, and the player who wins the most rounds is the winner. This level teaches counting and adding coins.&#10;&#10;In level two, each player starts with five dollars.  On each round they roll two money dice and pay the amount indicated to the bank by making change from one dollar. At the end of the round, the player with the most change left wins, and keeps his change.  All other players put their change back in the tray. At the end of five rounds, the player with the most money in his or her pile wins.  This level teaches making change from a dollar.&#10;&#10;Level one offers a small amount of strategy (the press your luck mechanic of deciding whether to roll more dice and how many to roll) while level two is entirely luck.&#10;&#10;",

Players must then read the clock faces on their card and mark any matching times. First player to complete a row or column of clock faces calls bingo. The caller then checks to make sure they have made the correct matches, and if so declares that player the winner. If not, play continues until a row or column is correctly completed.&#10;&#10;",

Two pins are on 5 points and two pins are on 10 points.&#10;&#10;The scoring board is enclosed in a wooden frame. A twist is that between where the top is dropped and the scoring &quot;bowling pins&quot; are four pegs which are fixed to the board. These pegs cause the top to bounce around.&#10;&#10;The top is a wind-up top in two parts. The bottom metal part of top has the round top with a metal spindle. The spindle fits into the wooden upper part which has a spring inside the center hole and a pin on the outside edge to interlock with the bottom part. Thus one can wind up the top and holding the top between two fingers you can push the top loose by pushing down with a third finger.&#10;&#10;",

An imaginary cat, passed between players, chases an imaginary mouse who must escape it and eat cheese; or hide down a mouse hole; or turn into a cat-eating monster &ndash; or whatever the players invent. Because that&rsquo;s the aim of the game: to build upon its basic rules, redesign it on the fly and make it sillier while you play.&#10;&#10;The game is now available in digital and print editions as a 48-page illustrated storybook. The book includes full instructions so that anyone can play, fun extra features and details of numerous popular variants in five sections:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Getting Started&#10;     Extending the Game: Cheese&#10;     Extending the Game: Mouse Holes&#10;     More Features&#10;     Adding Your Own Rules&#10;&#10;&#10;A free sampler PDF including the Getting Started section is also available.&#10;&#10;All versions are available from www.catonyerhead.com&#10;&#10;",

Will you resist mutation and survive, or give in to the inevitable and join the evolved?&#10;&#10;In the game, players are humans on a solitary journey to a promised safe house. This journey takes them through ten zones, with the zones being tile-based and randomly generated. As they travel, they encounter each other, other humans, and posthuman mutants. Encounters with mutants may inflict scars, and the more scars players have, the less human they are and the more posthuman they become. Will they strive to cling to their humanity and make a run for the safe house, winning the game? Or will they give in to the ever more tempting mutation, join the posthuman, and deny the win from the rest of the humans?&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Aggressive worker placement. Control a tribe of stone creatures fighting, mining &amp; building in the heart of an asteroid. 1 to 4 players. Caverns &amp; Crystals is a worker placement game that relies on direct conflict between players as each tries to gather the most resources and build their tribe of Stone Imps to its maximum potential.&#10;&#10;The board is made up of six hexagonal cards in a circle representing an asteroid drifting through space. As the game progresses (depending upon the turn cards that are placed in the center)three resources are placed upon the cards: Stone, used for spawning more members of your tribe, Metal, used to beat your opponent into submission and precious power crystals which will win you the game! By tactically placing your Stone Imps onto different Cavern Cards on the board you can dominate an area and ensure it is your imps who bring the crystals home. Be careful however, as somewhere in that asteroid there is a very hungry space squid placed secretly by another player that will devour your tribe and a vacuum that will eject them into space!&#10;Most importantly you have an Imp king leading your tribe who will give your imps a dramatic boost when used with forethought. At the beginning of the turn a set of six cards is passed around to each player who takes one secretly. Each card gives your king a power to use for that turn whether it is sneaking into an opponents home to take their resources or surprising your opponents by teleporting your tribe at the last minute. You will have to think very carefully as you select your card and ponder what your opponents have chosen.       &#10;Caverns &amp; Crystals can even be played Solo where it ceases to be a game of deducing your opponents' actions and becomes an intense puzzle where a player must be as efficient as possible to succeed. The Game Itself comes in a small tin ensuring it remains safe and undamaged between plays.&#10;&#10;So do you have what it takes to build your tribe and Rule the Rock!&#10;&#10;",

        "name": "Miracle at Dunkerque: The British Withdrawal From France",
        "description": "In May of 1940 the German army invaded Holland, Belgium and France.  In a matter of a few weeks they rolled up the combined armies of Belgium, France and Great Britain.  The BEF (British Expeditionary Force) and other nearby Allied forces were forced to retreat toward the French coast, resulting in about 400,000 men being surrounded near the town of Dunkirk. Rescue operations commenced to evacuate these forces to England and Winston Churchill, the new Prime Minister of Great Britain, was hopeful that perhaps 30,000 men could be rescued from the trap.  Admiral Sir Bertram Ramsay was put in charge of &ldquo;Operation Dynamo&rdquo;, the goal of which was to send ships of all sizes and shapes to evacuate these beleaguered soldiers from the beaches of France and Belgium.  Through skill, efficient planning and poor German coordination (along with some fortuitous luck), the operation was able to rescue an incredible 330,000 men from the pocket. A true military miracle had been performed and by doing so, the future of the Second World War was forever altered.&#10;&#10;Miracle at Dunkerque is essentially a solitaire game, but also includes a two-player option. It is meant to recreate the tense situation within the Dunkirk perimeter during those last eight days in May and June 1940.  The game design aims to capture the spirit of the difficult decision-making challenges faced by Allied commanders as they attempted to extricate the remnants of Britain&rsquo;s last field army from certain capture or death. Historically-based Event Cards drive the action and create varying circumstances each turn. The besieging German forces (army, air and naval units) are controlled by these cards, which are specifically designed to place constant pressure on the player. Allied Player Actions must be allocated each turn for the defense of the perimeter, the creation of evacuee units and the loading of these evacuees from the beaches and moles to available ships and then sailed onward to the safety of England.  You obviously cannot save all the Allied units, so you must choose who stays to fight and who shall attempt to escape in order to continue the struggle against the Nazis another day.&#10;&#10;Miracle at Dunkerque is designed by Hermann Luttmann and developed by Paul Fish. Chris Hansen provides additional development and playtesting support. This is the same team that put together the popular game, A Spoiled Victory. However, Miracle at Dunkerque represents a significant enhancement and expansion of that original design concept. The map is more extensive, the player now controls actual naval units that travel back and forth across the English Channel (hopefully loaded with evacuees), more combat units are provided to both sides and the air campaign is now represented. And of course there is the priceless added value of the incredible Legion Wargames production team. But just as importantly, the game system has been honed and polished so that despite the extra detail and chrome, this larger, deluxe edition of the game will play just as quickly as the original did.&#10;&#10;The ultimate goal of the Miracle at Dunkerque game design is to provide a different kind of gaming experience for the player &ndash; one that is both an evacuation management game and a tough, nail-biting perimeter defense and fighting withdrawal wargame. In any case, we hope that you find it a challenging, unique and fun game that gives you the feel for the nearly impossible position in which the Allied troops found themselves and the true extent of the miracle that occurred on the beaches of France that spring of 1940.&#10;&#10;",

While making the trek from Mannheim to Pforzheim, her car ran out of fuel in Wiesloch. Mrs. Benz stopped into the city drugstore to obtain the appropriate chemicals to make more fuel, effectively creating the world&acute;s first gas station.&#10;&#10;By the year 1928, Germany possessed a dense road network where combustion engines had triumphed over electric and steam engines and where cars were produced via assembly lines. Manufacturers began producing more affordable vehicles for the broader population.&#10;&#10;In&nbsp;Kraftwagen, players advance the state of automobile development and production by playing as start-up companies. They must research new technologies and build improved chassis and engines. Early Grand Prix races provide the young companies with prestige and money, but the players must maintain a key balance of fulfilling the demand preferences of buyers at the lowest possible price.&#10;&#10;Kraftwagen: V6 Edition&nbsp;includes a new set of tiles, featuring the next technology available at the time, the V6 Engine.&#10;&#10;",

Every player has a team of five animals, which move on the tight racetrack leading to the water source. The one who places at least two in the water first wins the game.&#10;&#10;In order to move the animals, players roll the dice. Every turn player roll all the dice, pick some of them and place on selected animal tile. Every animal is moved by two kinds of dice result only and player need to distribute his roll wisely. After that, the player may finish the placement and execute the moves or roll again excess dice and try to distribute them on additional animals. Of course, there is a catch: If you cannot place the dice correctly, your turn is lost.&#10;&#10;In advanced mode, every kind of animal have special ability: Giraffe has the longest neck, so may reach the water from neighboring space.

The Villagers don&rsquo;t know who the Werewolves are, and the Werewolves are trying to devour the Villagers one by one before the Villagers discover who they are.&#10;&#10;How to Play&#10;Choose a Moderator: He is not on either team and only manages the &ldquo;Day&rdquo; and &ldquo;Night&rdquo; phases of the game.&#10;&#10;Choose your cards: From the deck of Role cards, choose enough cards so that each player gets a card. Make sure you have at least 1 Werewolf card, 1 Seer card, and 1 Villager card for each of the remaining players. &#10;Example: for 7 players you will need. 1 Werewolf card, 1 Seer card, and 5 Villager cards.&#10;&#10;Shuffle the cards: Using only the cards you pulled out, shuffle the deck and deal a card to each player, face down. Each player secretly looks at their card, being careful not to let other players see it. Players may say anything they want about their card but they can not reveal their card at any time.&#10;&#10;Mark of the Werewolf takes place over a series of &ldquo;Day&rdquo; and &ldquo;Night&rdquo; Phases.&#10;&#10;NIGHT: During the night the Werewolves pick an innocent Villager as their victim, eliminating them from the game. The Seer will pick a player and learn if they are a Werewolf or not. The Moderator will lead the players through the Night Phase of the game following a script provided.&#10;&#10;DAY: During the day, the players try to discover who the Werewolves are. They do this by lynching one player during each Day Phase in an attempt to eliminate the Werewolves from the Village before the Werewolves kill all of the Villagers. Once a player has been lynched he must remain silent for the rest of the game. It is often best to have lynched players get up and watch from an area close by.&#10;&#10;Winning the Game&#10;Repeat the &ldquo;Day&rdquo; and &ldquo;Night&rdquo; phases until all Werewolves have been killed, or the number of Werewolves is equal to the number of Villagers (at which time the Werewolves overtake the village and win the game).&#10;&#10;The game comes with 54 Role Cards, 54 Treasure cards, 1 Rule book, and 1 Score pad. 44 unique role cards and 36 unique treasure cards. The combination of cards in this game are endless and will keep you and your friends entertained for hours on end.&#10;&#10;",

A distinctive feature of the game is that playing pieces are shared by all players, that is, players do not each have their own color of pieces.  Instead, each player is associated with two opposites sides of the board.&#10;&#10;Only white and black stones are used. The board starts empty. Taking turns clockwise, on his turn each player drops a single stone onto any empty space. The color of the stone must be different from the previous stone placed (thus, the stones alternate). The first stone to be played is black.&#10;&#10;A player wins in either of two ways: (1) By connecting his/her two sides with a chain of stones of either color (i.e. a black chain or a white chain); OR (2) by making a Y shaped chain that connects one of his/her sides with each of his/her opponents' sides on the opposite half of the board.&#10;&#10;The name Triskelion (pronounced try-SKEL-ee-un) is the name of a Celtic motif design that consists of three curved branches radiating from a center.&#10;&#10;",

You also have a common stock of card board plates, with different foods printed on them. At the start of the game every player gets few banknotes and when you run out of money, you drop out of the game. Last player with money wins the game.&#10;&#10;On your turn you add a plate in to waiters tray. If the waiter swings and plates drop, then you must pay him a tip. If plates don't drop, then you succeeded. In both cases it's the next players turn to add plate. This goes on until only one player has money.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "In El Grande, players take on the roles of Grandes in medieval Spain. The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions. To that end, you draft caballeros (knights in the form of meeples) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions. After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).&#10;&#10;A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo&mdash;a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king's pawn. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards vary from round to round.&#10;&#10;The goal is to have a majority of caballeros in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any meeples you had stashed there into the region you had secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande (large meeple) and in the region containing the king.&#10;&#10;El Grande Big Box, the 20th anniversary edition of El Grande, includes all previously published expansions: Grand Inquisitor &amp; Colonies, Grandissimo, King &amp; Intrigant, King &amp; Intrigant: Players' Edition and King &amp; Intrigant: Special Cards as well as something currently known only as the &quot;Anniversary Extension&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

Instead of &quot;Bingo!&quot; the player shouts &quot;Pink Elephant!&quot; Winner of the particular game gets point chips from other player depending on circumstances. PLayers then shuffle cards and start another round.&#10;&#10;Overall winner is player who has the most points at the conclusion of play. (The rules are nebulous on how many rounds should be played.)&#10;&#10;Another twist in this game is how the squares to be covered are to be selected. Instead of a draw bag as in Bingo a top is used. On the tops spindle are placed two plastic discs. One red and one white. The top with the two discs is spun in the game box bottom which has a gridded board with various colored animals in it.&#10;&#10;The red disc indicates what color of animal should be covered and the white disc indicates what animal. There are also provisions in the rules for covering multiple spaces. As an added twist it is acceptable to nudge the top to try and get it to throw a disc off in a particular direction!&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Kite Fight includes three games in one box, with players using the kite, wind and lightning cards in different ways depending on what they're playing. The games included are:&#10;&#10;&bull; Catch the Wind &mdash; Imagine playing in a park with the land divided into quadrants by wind cards. Over the course of the game, players place kite cards in different parts of the park (that is, the space between wind cards) to try to have the highest valued kite cards on top of the stack, but the first card played in a quadrant determines which cards can be played to that area subsequently. Designer Jason Kotarski describes this game as &quot;sort of a twist on trick-taking with players playing to multiple tricks at once over multiple rounds&quot;.&#10;&#10;&bull; Ride the Skies &mdash; Wind cards fill the air (or rather the table as they're laid out in a grid), and players place their kite cards on top of them to ride the wind. The trick, though is that the card being placed must be equal to the sum of the card being played on and one of the adjacent cards in the grid. Once all of the wind cards are covered, players check each pile to see who played the most cards on each pile, awarding the wind card to that player.&#10;&#10;&bull; Full of Air &mdash; Catch the most wind cards by participating in kite fights and outnumbering everyone else. To set up, a few wind cards are placed face up on the table, then players take turns placing a kite card at either end of the row, creating a sequence of 1-10 in each row. When a row is complete, whoever contributes the most claims the wind card from that row. Lightning cards let you zap another player's card and replace it with one of your own.&#10;&#10;",

They must compete to buy and utilize nightclubs, popular restaurants, tourist attractions, trinket shops, street bands, and more.&#10;&#10;Players begin the game as one of several possible businesses, all with unique abilities. During a round, custom dice are rolled to create the action pool for all players. As players take their turns, they select a die for its action and execute it. Depending on what you choose, you'll be attracting tourists or cashing them out, buying new businesses (with new abilities), hiring new employees, etc. Combine that with blocking opponents out of actions, taking advantages of citywide events, and playing in a high-stakes poker game using the tableau you build...and you have Big Easy Business.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "For thousands of years the Dragons have ruled the world of Erien, but their domain has become infested by other races - Elves, Dwarves, Fae, and worst of all, humankind. The dragons have done what they can to slow the process but the humans bred like rabbits and the other races weren&rsquo;t much better. It didn&rsquo;t take long for the inevitable conflict over resources to begin and the dragons soon realized that they didn&rsquo;t stand a chance against the combined strength of the new races. Those dragons that survived are now forced to fight amongst themselves for food, a home, breeding grounds and anything else they want. They have taken to the skies to battle it out with others of their kind, knowing only the strongest amongst them will survive to become the lords of the skies.&#10;&#10;Players take on the role of Dragons as they battle against one another in the skies over Erien. Their old sense of pride and self-importance mean that they must have the best feeding grounds available even if it means fighting other dragons to get it.&#10;&#10;The game uses a system where at the start of each turn the players plot out their dragon&rsquo;s movement for the turn. Movement is truly 3D allowing the dragons to fly up, down, left, right or any combination of directions. Elevation is tracked with stacking tiles and turns are shown with angled tilt blocks. Then with a bit of luck as their plans unfold on the game map their plans will have put them in to a better position to strike either with breath weapon or claw.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Quiet for so long, the Night is rising again, spreading its tendrils of evil through the empty and unwatched backwaters of the world. Once again, Vampires are spreading from den to den, adding locals to the body count &hellip; or to their ranks. Can the Order regain its former strength and push back the tide of evil?&#10;&#10;The Order of Vampire Hunters is a fully co-operative miniature-based board game for 1-4 players. It brings the dark imagery of Vampire lore from the classic stories in movies and books to your table top, as you take on the role of a newly recruited Vampire Hunter. Thrown into the Vampire den with a small band of comrades, you use stakes, crossbows and holy water to destroy the creatures of the Night. Craft makeshift weapons on the fly for more destructive power.  Tear down window coverings to burn the Vampires with rays of Sunlight. Drag screaming Vampires outside the den with the Extractor. Team up and make combination attacks on your enemies. Always stay focused on your mission to power your special abilities.&#10;&#10;But watch the clock: at sundown, you become the prey!&#10;&#10;Optional game modes add to the replayability. Play standalone games or follow the full campaign, upgrading your weapons, equipment and special skills as you advance in the Order.  Play semi-coop to rate your skills, giving bragging rights to the best Hunter.  You can even play on as a Vampire, if your Hunter gets turned. Make The Order of Vampire Hunters the experience you want it to be!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Keeping true to the spirit of time and the epic, the game focuses on the actions of heroes and constant involvement of the gods who are always ready to lend a hand to one side or the other. Common soldiers also have a role to play, and initially, their role comes down to guarding their champion. But beware, without a phalanx to support him, even Achilles may be felled by the hand of well-trained rank and file troops. During the battle, each player will try to defeat the opposing army in the field or to push it back to its base &ndash; Troy, or the Achaean camp. And then, when the going gets rough, and the battlements have to be breached, every single warrior is precious. Only good coordination of all elements &ndash; the power of heroes, the much needed support of the soldiers and timely interventions of the gods, can secure victory. Tyche be with you!&#10;&#10;",

The catch is that there is one less spinner than there are players. So in each round one player won't get a chance to obtain a Bandersnatch part.&#10;&#10;The players all grab for a spinner when any player builds a hand of 4 cards of the same color. So there is an action/dexterity element to the game too.&#10;&#10;Play begins with dealing 4 cards to each player. On a signal of go from the dealer all players look at their cards. If no one has four of a kind then each player passes card card face down to player on left. Again on go player pick up card and dtermine if they have four of a kind.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "4:20 is a dice rolling game for 1 to 4 players. The aim of the game is to roll as many joints from your boss&rsquo;s stash as possible.&#10;But what fun is that unless you get to dabble in the goods?&#10;By the time the clock hits 4:20am the player with the most J&rsquo;s is declared King of Toke!&#10;Just make sure you stay awake! Take too many puffs and risk &lsquo;greening out&rsquo;.&#10;Move around the apartment, gather Joints, feed the munchies by raiding the refrigerator,&#10;session up in the living room, or strip down and jump in the hot tub. The night is yours!&#10;&#10;Setup:&#10;Place the Board in the middle of the table. Place the time marker on the 4:20pm square of the time track.&#10;Shuffle the Kitchen, living room, Hot Tub and Bedroom card decks and place each deck beside the corresponding room on the board.&#10;Place the Joint tokens beside the board in reach of everyone.&#10;Each player chooses a character and takes the corresponding player board and avatar.&#10;The person who&rsquo;s the biggest stoner starts. If you can&rsquo;t decide who that is &ndash; play rock paper scissors to decide.&#10;The Starting player places there character on any room in the house (except the bathroom). In clockwise order each player places their character in any empty room they choose (once again, not the bathroom). Only one player can be in any room at the same time.&#10;&#10;How to Play&#10;The starting player takes the 5 dice and rolls them all. They can then put aside any die they wish to keep (this is called &ldquo;locking&rdquo;). The player has 2 rerolls (unless stated otherwise like in &ldquo;The Bedroom&rdquo;) so can roll the dice 3 times in total per turn. After your rerolls you apply your results.&#10;Each Turn Consists of&#10;Resolve room power on board if it states &ldquo;Start of Turn&rdquo;&#10;Roll all Dice. Put aside any dice you wish to keep (All clock dice are automatically &ldquo;locked&rdquo; &ndash; see below)&#10;Reroll (this is optional) any dice up to 2 times except &ldquo;locked&rdquo; dice. They must be put aside.&#10;Resolve dice (see below for results and order)&#10; The Dice Results are as follows&#10;&#10;    J = Take one J token (1 per J)&#10;    M = Move. You must move to another location in the apartment. If it is occupied by another player they must move to your location as only one player per room is allowed. If 2 M&rsquo;s are rolled you do not move and must take a card from the room deck you are in. If 3 M&rsquo;s are rolled and you have no rerolls left you must move to the bathroom square. Your turn is over and disregard any other dice results except clock rolls. (do not collect J&rsquo;s or dish out puffs)&#10;    C= Clock. Time passes and for every C rolled the time marker moves one square up. Every C rolled is instantly &ldquo;locked&rdquo;. You cannot reroll any C results (unless a card states otherwise).&#10;    P= Puff. All other players take a puff and must move their awake marker up one square on their player boards.&#10;&#10;&#10;Order in a turn&#10;When applying results, do so in the following order.&#10;1               IF you have 3 &ldquo;M&rsquo;s&rdquo; Proceed directly to bathroom , Ignore all other dice except clocks this turn. Advance clock if applicable and your turn ends.&#10;2               Take all J&rsquo;s&#10;3               Everyone else takes Puffs&#10;4               Move or take room card and resolve (if applicable)&#10;5               Advance clock&#10;6               End your turn. Pass dice to player on your left&#10; &#10;Bathroom:&#10;Nature called and you had to go to the bathroom. Damn, the locks broken.. How the hell do you get out you ask?! Getting stuck in the bathroom is no fun at all.&#10;As soon as you enter the bathroom lose 5 J&rsquo;s (they fell in!)&#10;Roll dice as usual but.....Bathroom rolls are a bit different&#10;No&rdquo; J&rdquo; results count when rolling dice, you can still make the others take puffs and the clock still ticks on as normal.&#10;&#10;Escaping the Bathroom:&#10;The only way out of the bathroom space (unless you have a card)  is by rolling and &ldquo;locking&rdquo; 2 &ldquo;M&rsquo;s&rdquo;. You must then go to any empty room in the house and play on as normal. If you have any rerolls left this turn you may continue to roll unlocked dice. Resolve dice normally at the end of your turn (ignoring the 2 &ldquo;M&rsquo;s&rdquo; used to escape the bathroom).&#10; Time / Awake Tracks / Game End&#10;If any players awake track hits &ldquo;white out&rdquo; that player has fallen asleep and is out of the game. If all other players fall asleep the last player awake is the winner.&#10;As soon as the time track hits 4:20am the game is over. All awake players add up their J&rsquo;s and the stoner with the most wins! If that is also tied the most awake stoner wins....&#10;If both J&rsquo;s and Awake are tied..... geeeze?!?

Though a Corsair enters the Expanse with but a single old ship and a handful of loyal crew, they may eventually command up to three customized ships, a trio of cargo shuttles, and more than a dozen squads of seasoned soldiers. Ships can be upgraded, territory claimed, and rivals fought both in space and on the ground. Conflict with other Corsairs is likely as each attempts to increase his or her reputation by demonstrating political influence, technical savvy, and a willingness to do whatever it takes to secure the Expanse.&#10;&#10;During his or her turn a player will move their ships and choose actions from one of four categories (Technology, Politics, Personnel, or Finance), - deploying troops to hold territory and positioning resources where they are most needed. Potential combat is resolved and then the next player takes a turn.&#10;&#10;&#10;    The ultimate goal is to earn enough Commendations to be granted sole governorship of the Expanse.&#10;    Technology, Politics, and Contract Cards have important game effects and also earn the Reputation needed to win Commendations.&#10;    The cards are gained using  resources harvested from the board and by fulfilling a contracts.&#10;    Employing their ship(s) and crew, a player must to secure enough resources or complete enough contracts to propel themselves to victory, while hindering (or destroying) the competition.&#10;&#10;&#10;- - - Full Component List for Standard Edition - - -&#10;&#10;Plastic:&#10;&#10;    16 player ships (2 of each type)&#10;     2 cruisers&#10;     6 alien scout ships&#10;    15 shuttles (3 in each player color)&#10;    75 crew figures (15 in each player color)&#10;    17 flight stands  (3 in each player color + 2 black)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    40 orange cubes (damage markers)&#10;    25 blue cubes (for resource levels and contracts)&#10;     2 dice&#10;&#10;&#10;Boards &amp; Mats:&#10;&#10;    12 sector tiles&#10;     5 player mats (1 in each player color)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    16 ship mats&#10;     4 small reference mats&#10;     1 non-player phase mat (ConFed /Alien Phase)&#10;&#10;&#10;Cards:&#10;&#10;    46 politics (blue) cards&#10;    46 technology (yellow) cards&#10;    46 contract (grey) cards&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Other:&#10;&#10;    1 rule book (28 pages)&#10;    1 lore book (12 pages)&#10;    1 reference page  (1 page)&#10;    1 box with custom insert&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;3 punch boards containing:&#10;&#10;&#10;        Cargo Tokens:&#10;            18 tribute tokens&#10;            18 politics tokens&#10;            18 recruit tokens&#10;            18 metal tokens&#10;            30 kiloCredit tokens&#10;            16 shield tokens&#10;            16 bomb tokens&#10;            16 fortification tokens&#10;            12 player &amp; alien logo tokens&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;       Round Tokens:&#10;             9 &ldquo;plus four&rdquo; tokens&#10;            15 battle station tokens&#10;            27 commendation tokens&#10;             6 A, B, C tokens&#10;            30 ownership tokens &#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;       Large Tokens:&#10;            8 minefield / forbidden zone tiles&#10;            1 Alien/ConFed phase token&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Critical Mass is a fast-paced mech combat game. Players go head-to-head in this fighting-strategy game with deck-building aspects. Players choose their favorite mech to battle it out, with each mech offering a different loadout of cards to start the game and unique powers.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players play a card face-down. When both players have chosen a card, they reveal them. Cards resolve based on their speed if they haven't been interrupted. Weapons deal damage and interrupt the enemy, while defending avoids weapon hits. Upgrading offers you additional cards to add to your arsenal but is vulnerable to being interrupted. Lastly, recharge reloads spent cards.&#10;&#10;As cards are played, they go to their owner's cool-down pile, where they remain until they're reloaded. As players take damage, the armor on their mech is destroyed. When enough armor is destroyed, an armor core becomes vulnerable and can be destroyed to stun that mech for the next turn. The game ends when a mech's armor is completely destroyed down to the last core.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "You are mighty VIKINGS! Mighty, but very small. As you sail your ship around a bottlecap, you will loot and plunder gold and wood to improve your city (granting you new abilities) and gain victory points. And while you may get hurt along the way, sometimes it's best to just push ahead, because the Valkyries don't come to claim the dead immediately...&#10;&#10;Bottlecap Vikings is a small rondel game with a ton of replayability. The rondel spaces are not fixed in place- they are randomized at the beginning of the game. Not only that, they're double-sided, so you might never play on the exact same configuration twice. There are two different victory conditions, and players each have a small &quot;tech-tree&quot; in their city with multiple viable paths. Furthermore, the city cards are double-sided, one side is identical for all players, and the other side is unique. To top it off, the crux of the gameplay is the push-your-luck damage system, which makes you value spaces differently depending on how damaged you or others already are.&#10;&#10;Bottlecap Vikings is packaged with 3 mini-expansions for other Tasty Minstrel Games&#10;Harbour: Ice Viking&#10;Gold West: Bandits Promo&#10;Eminent Domain: Battlecruisers &#226;&#128;&#147; Heavy Assault&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;In The Others, the world stands on the brink of apocalypse, as the fanatics of the Hell Club have summoned the 7 Deadly Sins to lay waste to our reality. Slowly the Others have creeped into our lives, corrupting society from within. The city of Haven is the key to their invasion, but it will not go down without a fight, thanks to the actions of the paranormal organization known as F.A.I.T.H. (Federal Authority for the Interdiction of Transdimensional Horrors). Each session of The Others is played with one player controlling the forces of a single Sin, against the other players who control a team of 7 FAITH heroes. The heroes cooperate to survive the Sin's attacks and accomplish the missions set before them, while the Sin attempts to thwart the heroes in all ways (preferably by destroying them).&#10;&#10;The heroes are divided into different classes, each specialized in a different aspect of the game. Leaders are good at helping the other members of the team. Bruisers are excellent melee fighters. Snipers are experts at using guns to put down monsters from a distance. And Fixers have the resourcefulness and knowledge of the occult necessary to resolve supernatural crises that spread through the city. Each hero also has their own stats and unique abilities that set them apart from all others. Knowing when to bring in the right reinforcement can be key to FAITH&rsquo;s victory.&#10;&#10;Corruption is one of the main mechanics of the game. It is both a way for the Sin to consume heroes, and a way for heroes to accomplish amazing feats they wouldn&rsquo;t be capable of normally. Taking corruption grants heroes powerful bonuses (as long as they keep taking corruption), but when they become fully corrupted, their darkest secrets may come back to haunt them and tear the team from within, or their flesh might simply succumb to the sinful influences.&#10;&#10;The Sins player, on the other hand, has access to the different monsters of each Sin, including Abominations, a Controller, and the terrifying Avatar of Sin! These monsters can attempt to destroy the heroes, or simply hinder their progress on their missions. Each Sin provides the Sins Player with a different deck of Sins cards that can be played at different times to surprise players with different effects, often tied to the strategy of each Sin. Yes, because each Sin taints the game with an overarching mechanic that is always in effect. For example, Pride punishes prideful heroes that venture into the streets on their own, while Sloth punishes heroes who try to move quickly across the board. Heroes will need to learn to deal with the different influence of each Sin, which will always stand between them and their mission.&#10;&#10;The Sins are also aided by Acolytes, with each session using a different type. These lowly corrupted servants of darkness can fight and stand in the way of heroes, but they also have a once per round special ability that reflects their previous lives. For example, corrupted hobos take equipment from heroes, corrupted nuns corrupt the city districts, and corrupted doctors keep heroes from healing.&#10;&#10;There are 7 different stories that players can embark on for each session of The Others. Each of them brings different special rules, different dynamics, and a unique system of branching missions the heroes need to accomplish in order to be victorious. There are Terror stories, which are more straightforward, focusing on action and combat; Corruption stories revolve around the Corruption spreading through the city and the heroes themselves; and Redemption stories rely on saving the city and the few innocents that remain. Each story can be played on a different map setup, which further makes the dynamic of each session unique.&#10;&#10;The board used in The Others is made up of several tiles, each depicting a different city district and different configurations of streets. As the city of Haven still belongs to humanity, and it&rsquo;s the Sins that are attempting to take it over, the heroes can use it to get different benefits each district offers them. For example, they can go to the hospital to heal wounds, to the museum to get rid of corruption, to the RavenCorp tower to get new equipment, or to the police station to call in an orbital strike. What districts are available on each map, and their location, can greatly change the dynamic of the game.&#10;&#10;As the game progresses, and depending on how badly the heroes fare against storyline plot twists and developments, the Apocalypse Track will advance, making the Sins gradually stronger and more terrifying. Apocalypse cards, tied to the type of story being played (Terror, Corruption, or Redemption) introduce new twists and challenges to the game, even bringing in the members of the Hell Club themselves!&#10;&#10;Heroes will die. Either in noble sacrifice, torn apart by claws and tentacles, or consumed by the corruption welling up in their souls. The question is whether the FAITH team will manage to fulfill their final mission in time, or whether the Sins will reign supreme over humanity.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "This is a great game, with plenty of detail, of the critical Battle of Quatre Bras fought between Marshall Ney and the Duke of Wellington on 16 June 1815.  The battle is an excellent example of a Meeting Engagement, which will provide you the ability to easily alter the flow of the battle, and its tempo.  The French II Corps, reinforced with the Light Cavalry of the Imperial Guard, is ordered to take the crossroads and send some troops to the east to help Napoleon, who is fighting the Prussians.  This game will smoothly connect to the Ligny battlefield maps when the Ligny game is released.  This game contains the Order of Battle charts, and supporting charts, for the entire 4 game set.&#10;&#10;Scenarios include:&#10;&#10;    The Battle of Quatre Bras - for those of you who want to play the entire event.&#10;    15 June 1815 - for those who want a really small scenario that plays quickly.  The French Lancers of the Imperial Guard attempt to outmaneuver the small Dutch/Nassau force holding just north of Frasnes and take the crossroads in a quick battle.&#10;    Counter-Attack at Thyle - for those who want a really small scenario that plays quickly.  The French must take the town of Thyle and the British must hold it.  Counter density is very low.&#10;    Hooves of Destruction - where the French Cuirassiers and Lancers of Pire's 2nd Cavalry Division manage to catch a British Battalion unprepared for a cavalry charge and the unthinkable happens.&#10;    The Guard Attacks - the British Guard has popped out of the Bois de Bossu and is hitting the French to push them south.  Their over-zealous pursuit puts them in a bad position when the French cavalry again begins some fine charges.&#10;&#10;&#10;Key Features                                                                     &#10;&#10;       (8) 11&quot; x 17&quot; game maps of the Quatre Bras area&#10;      (8) Full Color Order of Battle Charts&#10;     Numerous charts and tables&#10;      Variable combat strengths&#10;       Reduction by Levels of Order&#10;       Restructured rules and Quatre Bras Rules Supplement with National Doctrinal Rules&#10;       Approximately 1400 Die Cut Unit Counters and Markers&#10;       Infantry and Cavalry units at the company and squadron level and artillery at the section level&#10;       Battalion level infantry and Regiment level cavalry units&#10;       (5) Scenarios that allow play on smaller parts of the battle or the entire affair&#10;       Highly detailed without overbearing rules&#10;      Excellent Solitaire Play&#10;&#10;&#10;(from Grognard sim's website)&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Demi: Labyrinth of the Gods is a cooperative game where each player takes on the role of a modern day demigod (there are eight to choose from). These 2-4 players must then work together to navigate a labyrinth that shifts and changes as you play, while trying to accomplish the task of finding three ancient artifacts the gods have demanded in order to prove your worth and gain access to the exit - but there's a catch!  This labyrinth is filled with mythic monsters and traps...&#10;&#10;This is a tile-based game.  A grid of thirty face-down tiles represent rooms within the labyrinth.  Players move together as one, flipping over a room to move into it, one room at a time.  To represent the fact that the Labyrinth is always in motion, when the players enter a new room they choose the orientation of that room (provided one entrance/exit points back the way they came).  They then replace the room they came from with a room from the next difficulty tier.&#10;&#10;Within each room they draw from an encounter deck and face off against monsters out of Greek mythology, traps, or if lucky - a pile of resources they can use to upgrade their gear or utilize their special abilities.&#10;&#10;Each of the eight demigods has three special abilities:  A Free Ability they can utilize anytime the text applies, a Cost Ability they can pay resources they've gathered to activate, and a Coin-Flip ability they receive later in the game, letting them tempt the fates for a positive or potentially negative outcome.&#10;&#10;Winning means reaching opposite corners three times to gather the three artifacts, then back once more to find the exit - the shifting rooms that are constantly replaced as you progress means player tactics in room orientation to determine the route become a deciding factor in the group's ability to make it out alive.&#10;&#10;",

Six dinosaur cards with special powers are included as well, and you customize the deck before the start of play based on the number of players.&#10;&#10;During the game, players try to rid themselves of cards along the lines of Cheat. At the start of a round, a player lays 1-4 cards face down and claims they're a type of animal, which they may or may not be! The next player either also lays down 1-4 cards and claims they're the same type of animal or calls out the previous player by flipping over one of the cards previously played. If that card matches the animal claimed, the current player takes all played cards in hand; if not, the previous player does. If the card revealed is a dinosaur, then some special power takes effect. Whatever the case, the next player then starts a new round.&#10;&#10;Whenever a player has all cards of a particular type of animal in hand, they discard those animals immediately, removing them from the game.&#10;&#10;As soon as a player runs out of cards, whether by discarding a type of animal or by playing their final cards (and not being proved a liar), the game ends and they win!&#10;&#10;",

Offense and defense can choose their personnel and can be either aggressive or conservative.  Offense can pick from run or pass plays.  Defense can pick a focus area of the field.  The 144 possible outcomes match real football averages at the play and possession levels. Try playing with your own personal game-plan or style.  You can be a conservative team that runs the ball and controls field-position.  Or you can be a wide-open passing team that takes aggressive risks on defense.&#10;&#10;The Flip play solution is a diagrammatical solution of the offense and defense play pairing.  Each offense play-card has a play arrow which is positioned in one of six lanes.  Each defense play-card has play outcome arrows in each of these lanes.  The cards are aligned and the offense play arrow will line up with one of the defense outcome arrows yielding the outcome of the card pairing and the play.&#10;&#10;Each team has three kick tables for kick-offs, punts, and field goals.  These tables are used with three dice and the results match real football stats.&#10;&#10;Four possessions per side is a quick game (30 minutes) and eight possessions per side is a qood game (60 minutes).&#10;&#10;",

England has been at peace for a decade, the family and guests are at the Hall for a evening meal, the cook has prepared a delightful supper, and the staff have arranged the summer&rsquo;s mauve and white flowers in crystal vases in impecible fashion. Everything is simply tip-top ... except for the still-warm body found on the grounds of Woodperry Hall. Was it murder or suicide? Was it simply an accident, or something far more sinister? Oh, without a doubt it&rsquo;s murder alright, and now Oxford City Police detectives will arrive and dramatically solve the case. Who will be discovered to have commited the crime?&#10;&#10;A Very English Murder: Murder at Woodperry Hall is a three- to eight-player murder mystery game set in the fictional village of Thornbury, near Oxford, England in 1955. It is a narrative game where players cooperatively construct a story about a murder that takes place by answering questions and trying to appear innocent. Each player assumes the role of a character who is frequently found in classic English murder mystery novels. Every turn, one player assumes the role of an Oxford City Police Detective to question the other players who, in turn, build a case against each other to make sure another character is responsible for the murder that took place. At the end of the game, the Detective will solve the crime and&mdash;in dramatic fashion&mdash;reveal who the murderer is. Will you turn out to be the one who committed the murder?&#10;&#10;",

But Dr. Doom, Mole Man, and Annihilus are out there to prevent you from carrying out your plan.

They then place a marker on a space that displays the resulting number.  If another marker is already on the space, the marker must be placed on another matching space. If the square has instructions, the player follows those instructions. If the player lands on a space with a villain, their marker is stuck there until all other markers are placed. A Silver Surfer space allows the player to move the marker to any space. The first player to place one marker on each member of the Fantastic Four wins.&#10;&#10;",

Players jointly contribute to the construction of the cave.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to finish alive with the most experience points gained during the race.&#10;&#10;Each turn, player's put a small part of the cave on the table, representing either the ceiling or the floor of the cave. By doing so, a long small cave is created on which different dangerous objects or animals (vampiric bat, giant centipedes, laser beams, etc) are shown. During movement the bat-planes fly either along the cave ceiling or along the cave floor until they arrive at a cave and have to encounter its horrors. The dice-fight that follows during an encounter can be won (experience points are gained) or lost, depending on the strength and equipment of the bat-plane. Players can strengthen their bat-planes by upgrading various parts of their plane (shields, short-range attack, plate armor, power, maneuverability and navigation &amp; control), however only at specific locations in the cave. Players can not only invest their money in upgrades, they can also decide to buy long-range missiles or booster fuel. The long-range missiles can be used to shoot rivals, caves and obstructions. Booster fuel is used to outmaneuver other players by playing an extra turn or to move diagonally. Some cave locations also offer the possibility to explore the local environment, and with a bit of luck player's  might find special upgrades there.&#10;&#10;Each game, the layout, the length and the difficulty of the cave is different. It is a tactical game, thrilling to the last turn, based on a few simple rules, in a steampunk sci-fi technological world, where players have to continually cope with limited resources.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Ancient and mysterious entities, known only as Artifacts, drift from planet to planet engulfing entire civilizations. They travel together, appear on a planet, and cause nations to frenzy. Most recently, they appeared on Gallia. Players represent factions fighting for control of these Artifacts. Some want them destroyed entirely. Some simply don&rsquo;t want them in enemy hands. And still, others want to use their power to enslave the world. Players will have to build their teams and enter the battlefield. Lose, and you have failed your people, perhaps your entire civilization.&#10;&#10;Skirmish Dice is a customizable skirmish game. Using powerful leaders, sizable brutes, clever totems, and more, players customize their teams and send them into battle. Units are represented by dice on the field, and each unit&rsquo;s corresponding card holds its actions, abilities, statistics, and more. The game is highly tactical and meant to move, meaning you can get the experience of a skirmish/squad level miniatures or card game in a smaller timeframe.&#10;&#10;While the units are dice, the game doesn&rsquo;t suffer from luck-induced chaos. The dice faces are significant to character abilities and are rolled to receive offensive and defensive bonuses. It&rsquo;s streamlined and quick to learn, but the strategy runs deep as team building can offer hundreds of combinations within factions.&#10;&#10;",

As they move, players land on spaces that allow them to pick one, two or three puzzle pieces.  They must take face-down pieces and try to match them to their puzzle.  If they match, the may be added to the puzzle.  If not, they are returned to the face-down pile.  Some spaces also force players to put a puzzle piece back or stay on the space until a certain number is spun.  The first player to complete his or her puzzle wins.&#10;&#10;",

When they land on a letter, they choose a face-down tile of the same color. If the letter matches, they must say the name of the letter and then may roll again. If the letter does not match or they misidentify it, their turn is over. The first player to reach the end of the track wins.&#10;&#10;The board is two-sided. On one side, players must match upper-case with upper-case letters. On the other side, a more difficult match between lower-case and upper case is required.&#10;&#10;",

Juggernaut, that unstoppable engine of destruction, is roaming about the X-Mansion.  Professor X's life is at risk.  He telepathically calls his X-Men to the rescue.  However, they are already on a mission to prevent Magneto from enrolling the Morlocks and their leader, Callisto, into his deadly plans.  Help the X-Men stop the villains and restore safety to the X-Mansion.&#10;&#10;X-Men was published as part of the Marvel Comics Super Heroes Game Book, and the board is a double-page spread of the book which is laid flat to play. It is in the Pachisi/Sorry family.  Each player has four markers. A roll of 4 is needed to get a marker on the start space. After that, they must enter a track and make their way around to their color of ladder  They must then make their way up the ladder and roll the exact number to land on the X-Mansion.  Along the way, if they land on another player's marker, they may either send it back to the start or take another turn. Spaces marked with villains move the marker backward or cause loss of a turn. The first player to land all four markers on the X-Mansion wins.&#10;&#10;",

Each player in turn &quot;rolls&quot; the electronic die and moves one or the other token along the track, following any instructions on the space where they land.  Spaces may move players forward or back or cause them to lose or gain a turn. Since players have two tokens, a small element of strategy is introduced in deciding which token is more advantageous to move with each roll.

        "description": "In the XVI century Italy was the scene of wars and dynastic quarrels. In the Papal States, Pope Paul III knew he could rely on the strength of the powerful Orsini family to oppose the power of his enemies. In 1542 Pierfrancesco II Orsini, called Vicino, inherited the fief of Bomarzo, which elected to his residence, along with the fiefs of Collepiccolo, Castelvecchio, Montenero and Mompeo. In 1547 Vicino Orsini wanted to celebrate the grandeur of his family, by commissioning one of the greatest architectural wonders of Italy. Within a natural amphitheater were masterfully carved huge mythological figures, whose sublime beauty enchants and terrifies those who are in their presence. Even today the park is shrouded in mystery: is it a Sacred Grove in which to bring votive offerings to the gods or a Park of Monsters made to scare poor people? It's rumored that Vicino Orsini owed his own fortune to the devotion shown to the gods and to the offers that he brought to them.&#10;&#10;In Bomarzo, you will have to delve into the mystery of the park, to propitiate the gods and obtain their favor. You&rsquo;ll play the role of one of the feudal lords of the Orsini and you&rsquo;ll manage one of four minor feuds, Collepiccolo, Castelvecchio, Montenero or Mompeo, trying to earn the esteem of your lord. If you&rsquo;ll develop your feud in the best way you will manage to prevail over your rivals. Do not forget the supernatural forces that dwell in Bomarzo: your existence and your achievement will be influenced by how you manage to turn in your advantage the will of the monsters of the park.&#10;&#10;Bomarzo is a game of deep strategy for 2-4 players, the short duration of which gives to the players' choices even more decisive importance. The careful management of resources will allow you to easily take advantage of the power of the monstrous deity of the park. Each turn you will be able to perform various operations in your fief and also you will have to choose which god ingratiate, through workers placement bound by auction. But beware: each divinity of the park requires a very specific offer to concede his favor otherwise unleash his monstrous fury on unwary visitors! To triumph in Bomarzo you not only need the best development but mostly to have tied your for-tunes to the most powerful and prestigious deity.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Unspeakable Words is the Call of Cthulhu Word Game designed by James Ernest and Mike Selinker. In the game, you and your opponents will attempt to form words from the letter cards in your hand. Each letter is worth points &ndash; the amount of points is determined by the number of angles in the letter (where the hounds of Tindalos are lurking!). You may try to make the highest scoring word possible, but&hellip; you&rsquo;ll have to test the strength of the word against a roll of the 20-sided die. Roll equal to or higher than the value of your word and you&rsquo;re safe&hellip; but roll less than the value of your word and you lose a precious piece of your sanity, represented by an adorable Cthulhu pawn!&#10;&#10;Each letter is uniquely illustrated with a horrifying character from the works of H.P. Lovecraft, which adds to the dark whimsy of the game.&#10;&#10;Since its release in 2007, Unspeakable Words has been received with great reviews. It was Games Magazine's Word Game of the Year and the Best Party Board Game at BoardGameGeek's Golden Geek Awards.  In 2008, a second edition of Unspeakable Words was released, this time with purple pawns. Because of the flexibility of the game, a second deck and second set of pawns can be added for twice as many players.&#10;&#10;Since the inception of Unspeakable Words, Playroom Entertainment has wanted to release more specialized editions. With this Kickstarter, supporters can upgrade the Unspeakable Words game with special multi-colored pawns (five pawns each of eight colors to play up to eight players!), a dice/pawn bag and additional cards! AND...this Deluxe Edition will feature artwork by famed artist John Kovalic! Plus, if we hit our stretch goals, even more amazing things will be added to the game!&#10;&#10;",

With amazing abilities, spells and magic weapons, you must explore the dungeons beneath the Sword Coast where you will fight monsters, overcome hazards and find treasure. Are you ready for adventure?&#10;&#10;Temple of Elemental Evil includes multiple scenarios, challenging quests, and co-operative game play designed for 1-5 players. The contents can also be combined with other D&amp;D Adventure System Cooperative play board games, including The Legend of Drizzt and Castle Ravenloft.&#10;&#10;Each player selects a hero, such as a fighter, cleric, or wizard. On their turn, each player can explore further into the dungeon (turn over new tiles), move through the already explored parts of the dungeon, and fight monsters. When a new dungeon tile is revealed, there is typically an encounter of some sort, and new monsters to fight are added. Slain monsters reward the players with treasure, and experience points, allowing them to level up and increase their skills during play. Players must cooperate to stay alive, slay the monsters, and achieve the goal of their quest. Each scenario has a different goal, from retrieving a relic to slaying a large boss monster.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Schr&ouml;dinger&rsquo;s Cats is a pseudo-scientific card game of strategic uncertainty for 2-6 players. A fast, fun game of bluffing, deduction, and cute cat pictures!&#10;&#10;Uncertainty didn&rsquo;t kill the cat, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s not dead. Dr. Erwin Schr&ouml;dinger and Werner Heisenberg taught us that. We&rsquo;ve all heard about the cats in boxes experiment and maybe we're even curious about the results -- but attempting such an experiment would be INSANE in real life! Now you can try your hand at challenging the uncertainty principle without risking the lives of innocent kittens or exposure to radioactive particles! Awww!&#10;&#10;In Schr&ouml;dinger&rsquo;s Cats players run experiments, form hypotheses, and try to one-up each other&rsquo;s research. Players take on the role of a Cat Physicist such as Albert Felinestein, Sally Prride, or Neil deGrasse Tabby! Using their special ability to help prove their hypothesis, or at least debunk someone else&rsquo;s, each cat physicist tries to determine the minimum number of alive cats, dead cats, or empty boxes across all the boxes in Schr&ouml;dinger&rsquo;s lab.&#10;&#10;You may not be certain your hypothesis is valid, but if you love cats, science, and games you will be certain to love the Schr&ouml;dinger's Cats card game!&#10;&#10;",

How many headbands were worn? Or how many weapons were pointing to the left? Was the second Indian from the right painted with war paint? Or is there an Indian wearing a shirt, and carrying a tomahawk? The player who is able to give the first correct answer, gains a token.&#10;&#10;The 10 playing cards in Kiqsuyapi are double-sided. They determine the level of difficulty of the game. With only 4 cards, the challenge is still moderate. With 10 cards even true champions are going to work up a sweat. And if you still consider this too easy, the expert version will be an even greater challenge for you. Here, all players have to answer and the right answer will gain you a point, as before. Wrong answers, however, will cost you points! This applies in particular to those questions that ask for two or even three aspects at once. For example, how many Indians are wearing a shirt, a headdress and are carrying a bow?&#10;&#10;",

Each turn comprises of three phases:&#10;&#10;The Pre-Show phase - Where players draft wrestlers to their roster and buy special Booster cards (to both improve their Roster and to hinder their opponents). Each player draws a House Show card and books their wrestlers to appear in their show. Finally decisions are made about the outcomes of the various segments such as which wrestlers are receiving pushes.&#10;&#10;The Showtime phase - Where players take turns describing (commentating) their Show and roll the dice to determine the results of the various Segments. Even the best laid plans and flawless booking can be undone on the night by bad luck, injuries or a crucially timed disruptive Boosters played by an opponent.&#10;&#10;The Post-Show phase - In the aftermath of the show players vote to give the best General Manager award to one player. Additionally, gate receipts are calculated, Rosters reorganised and Wrestler&rsquo;s appeased.&#10;&#10;The phases are played simultaneously by the players with the exception of part of the Showtime phase where players take turns to commentate on their own show and roll the dice to decide the results of Segments.&#10;&#10;During the each of the phases the players will have the opportunity to build a roster of wrestlers for their Promotion.  These wrestlers are further developed with Booster cards, such as pleasing moves, story lines, equipment and arenas, dirty tricks to play on rival player's promotions.&#10;&#10;Finally each player will then book their Wrestlers into Shows and Pay-Per-View special events in order to gain Popularity Points (PP). At the end of each Post-Show phase, the players count their Popularity Points; the player who reaches the goal number (different for the different variants) has managed to impress Network TV bosses, signed a TV Network deal and wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

By defeating these epic creatures, players gain glory and the favor of the gods. When the game ends, the player who has earned the most glory earns the title of Jarl and is recognized as a champion of Midgard!&#10;&#10;Placing workers allows for the collection of resources and warriors, which players may then send on journeys to neighboring villages or across the sea to defeat monsters and gain the glory they need for victory. Resources are used to carve runes, build ships, and feed your followers. Viking warriors (custom dice) do battle with the myriad enemies the town faces.&#10;&#10;",

        "description": "Flavor backstory:&#10;&#10;The Enclave is a city of opportunity and adventure; a place to earn a name for yourself. It's treacherous surroundings offer endless chances to take on daring quests and slay fearsome monsters.Of course slaying monsters requires quality gear, and you won't just find it laying around. But no worries, there are always tasks to be done to earn some coin; such as helping the blacksmith forge some tools, or helping the Inn Keeper fix up the place. While the Enclave has always been known as a &quot;safe haven&quot; from the terrors that surround it, recently it's fortification has been tested due to a Dragon that has made home near by. Although adventurers do come through often, not many are brave enough to go toe to toe with a dragon. That's where you come in! It's about time someone stood up to that gigantic, fire-breathing, armor-like-scale covered, razor fanged, flying pest. No true Hero wants to share that glorious triumph, so your on your own. It's time to forge your legacy!&#10;&#10;Gameplay Description:&#10;&#10;Each player stars the game by choosing a Hero. There are 4 races to choose from, Human, Elf, Dwarf, and Orc. Each has a unique starting deck of skill cards and 1 unique trait card. The skills are Strength, Dexterity, and Focus. These will be the power behind your actions. Each side of the main deck has 4 revealed cards. One side represents outside the Enclave, the other represents inside it. You will use the cards in your hand drawn from your deck to interact with the revealed cards. This includes slaying a monster, completing a task, or buying gear. Your actions reward experience in the form of skill cards. These are collected and then added to your deck once you level up. You can either buy bigger and badder gear, or upgrade what you have. You can also spend all of the cards in your hand to gain a new talent card which is added to your deck. Once you feel your ready to go, you can face off with the Dragon. Defeat it, and you've not only won the game, but also forged your name in glory for all of eternity! Or at least until an expansion comes out with a bigger dragon....&#10;&#10;What makes it Unique:&#10;&#10;Experience: Unlike other deck-building games, you don't &quot;buy&quot; cards from the main pool and add them into your deck. Instead you complete tasks and defeat monsters to earn &quot;experience&quot; in the form of skill cards. Those are what get's added to your deck. How does more of the same card help you? Most importantly, adding MORE of these cards allows you to level up your character. This also gives you a chance to really fine-tune your character. If you want to wield a sword, you'll need strength behind it, and so completing Strength tasks earns you more Strength cards. The more Strength cards in your deck, the more often you will draw them. Also, the more cards in your deck, the more turns you can take before you need to rest (recycling your discard pile for your deck). There are also trait cards such as Relentless, Fearsome, Agile, and Clever. Each of these provides a different effect when played. At the end of the game, you've built a truly unique Hero with a unique deck of cards to power it!&#10;&#10;Leveling: Each player only starts with a hand of 3 cards, which is then increased by leveling up your Hero. The larger hand size gives the player more potential power behind their actions, which is not only required to defeat the Dragon, but feels very rewarding.&#10;&#10;Theme implementation: The tasks in the game are simple labor jobs but the skills required to complete them are intuitive and logical. For example, the Blacksmiths' task requires Strength to forge ingots while the Alchemist' task of preparing potions requires Focus. This helps eliminate that disconnect many deck-building games have.&#10;&#10;These are just some of the many unique mechanics that make The Enclave a deck-building game that we feel truly stands out among the rest!&#10;&#10;The game is set to release at the end of April, 2015.&#10;&#10;",

Assets are earned primarily by passing Payday spots on the game board.  Money is also earned (and sometimes lost) by drawing Action cards, which assign set amounts or multiples of the wheel spin.&#10;&#10;There is a very linear board that you move along by spinning a wheel.  There are a handful of intersections where you can choose to go one direction or another but they ultimately have similar spaces and meet back up quickly.  The first one is a decision to either attend college (payment due and a longer track), or not - with different career cards drawn as a result of that decision.  There are a handful of choices regarding house speculation, but for the most part it is a game of luck.&#10;&#10;This game makes a number of updates to older games in the game family.  The maximum number of players has been reduced from 6 to 4, and a number of new cards and concepts have been introduced, increasing the randomness of asset collection.&#10;&#10;",

Now with 3 types of roles: witches, druids, and gatherers.&#10;    Drizzelda, the weather fairy, helps chase away the bad weather.&#10;    New illustrations and game pieces.&#10;    Same style of play, and by the same game designer as Witch&rsquo;s Brew.&#10;    New version also includes a 2-player version.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game is played over 7 rounds, with 4 turns per round. Each round, players simultaneously select 4 of their 10 role cards, and then they take turns playing one role at a time. Each role has a brave action and a cowardly action; the brave action is stronger, but riskier, as another player could steal the action from you later; the cowardly action is safer, but not as robust. How well can you bluff your opponents?&#10;&#10;Use the gatherer roles to collect ingredients to make potions, the witch roles to zoom around on your broom to different areas, and the witch or druid roles to deliver the potions, collecting victory points as you go. Chase away lightning clouds with the help of the weather fairy, and keep an eye on the event cards that change game play, one event per round.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player with the most victory points after all 7 rounds are complete and end-of-game bonus points have been awarded.&#10;&#10;",
